In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Although it continues to surprise me, I know many of you have trouble with metaphors and poetic language. You 
want facts and figures, something quantifiable and measureable. Something known not imaginary. I am willing to 
bet that even you played games as a child, read stories and watch movies. So let’s step into a world of signs and 
wonders, the world of the Book of Acts, the world of the early church. Come with me to Joppa and to Tabitha’s 
house and meet the only woman called a disciple in the New Testament.

What do we know about Tabitha? She lives in Joppa, a port city on the Mediterrean Sea. Although widows are in 
her house when Peter arrives, her own marital status is unknown. This suggests Tabitha is a woman of independent 
means. She is able to perform good works especially providing clothing for widows and their families. In the 
previous chapter of Acts, after baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch on the Gaza road, "Philip found himself at 
Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to 
Caesarea." (Acts 8:40 NRSV) 

I wondered just how far a walk that was so I typed into a search engine on my phone: How far is it from Azotus 
to Caesarea. I expected to find a series of biblically focused websites which would give me the info. No. The answer was there on my screen: 60 miles from Ashdod to Caesarea. Temperature: 67 degrees Farenheit. Traffic is light.

I have no idea if traffic was light when Philip worked his way up the coast. I do know Ashdod is the present day 
name of Azotus.

Philip would have passed through Joppa on his way home. Tabitha may have heard Philip preach and he may have 
baptized her. I like to think so.

However Tabitha comes to know Jesus, she becomes one of his disciples and performs good works and makes charitable 
donations. Then she gets sick and dies. Nothing out of the ordinary here. We have known lots of people like her.

Now messengers go to Lydda to ask Peter to come back with them. 

This is not the bungling disciple of the Gospels. This is Peter who has come into his own at Pentecost. This is 
the Peter who stands up to the authorities in Jerusalem and leads the early church. This is the Peter who 
performs signs and wonders in the name of Jesus. Some examples given in Acts: Peter has

* actively healed a lame man at the Beautiful Gate of the temple

  * passively healed sick people put out into the streets so his shadow passes over them

* Healed a bedridden man named Aeneas.

Lydda is about a 3-houur walk from Joppa. It is not clear why the messengers go. What is clear that they think 
Peter can help. And Peter goes with them--just like that. Their mission is urgent and time sensitive. He 
responds willingly.

"You can't," as my New Testament always said, "think a dead head." There is no way to know what was in Peter's 
mind as he entered the upper room in Tabith's house alone. Did he have an inkling of what he was going to do or 
was he feeling his way, open to the promptings of the Spirit, following Jesus' example when he raised Jairus's 
daughter? I can't say.

What I can say is that Tabitha is an ordinary disciple, going about her business, doing Jesus’ work as well as 
she can. She made an impact in a small circle of widows and community of disciples. Tabitha, living in a city 
where we have no record of a Christian church until the fifth century, finds herself lying in her upper room 
with a man she has never seen before holding her hand and telling her to rise. No wonder she sat up.

News spread 
throughout the city. I am certain Tabitha had to put down her sewing more than once to talk to a curiosity 
seeker. You can picture it, can’t you? She is hemming a cloak when someone comes in and starts questioning her. 
The temptation is great to send them away. She is busy. But instead she, and perhaps the widow she is helping, 
sit down, hem trailing, to give their witness to this stranger. "Come and hear more on Sunday," Tabitha says 
when the stranger leaves. "Jesus died on the cross and rose to life forever for you and me. This body of mine 
will die again, but because of Jesus, I am here today, an ordinary woman, performing an ordinary task, helping 
someone less fortunate than me, sharing the good news with you. was Tabitha is a wonder not just for the first's 
century people of Joppa. She is a sign of Jesus’ comfort and assurance for each one of you. She is why you came 
today, to hear that death is not the last word. Jesus won the victory over death not just for himself, not just 
for Tabitha, but for you and everyone you love. Jesus and Tabitha live and so will you. Amen.
