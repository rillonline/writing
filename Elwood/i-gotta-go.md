# I Gotta Go #

When I untied Elwood this morning in preparation for going out, he
began dashing wildly about, up and down the hall. Up onto the braille
printer, hitting the form feed button. Back down the hall and back,
knocking over the floor lamp. Another turn and more paper spewed
forth. Finally, the leash was attached and he made it out in the knick
of time.

AUpon his return to the apartment, he continued to be excited.
fortunately, none of his restlessness was destructive. He simply had
trouble settling down to go to his place so I could start preparing
his breakfast.

Once he was fed, he was his gentle self.

I guess that's what happens when you don't poop at dinnertime or
bedtime. You're raring to go the next morning in more ways than one.
