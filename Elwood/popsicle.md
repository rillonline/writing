This time, however, when I pressed down on the knife, one frozen
sausage flew off the kitchen counter and landed in Elwood's water
bowl.

Now both dogs and people know the rules about food:

1. Anything that hits the floor legally belongs to the dog.

2. Anything in the dog's dish is definitely the dog's.

Therefore, the frozen sausage in Elwood's water bowl was his. Rinsing
something off which has fallen onto the floor is one thing. Retrieving
food from a dog's bowl is another.

So Elwood had a sausage Popsicle for breakfast, after his own healthy
dog breakfast.

The only problem is-- He now watches closely any time I take more
sausages out of the freezer. He will no doubt do this forever because,
you never know, one may fly off the kitchen counter and land where
it's legal to grab it.

I'm just grateful I don't have sausage Popsicle's in my freezer for me.
It just sounds yucky though he was happy enough to crunch his.
