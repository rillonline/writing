*  Chapter Zero:  Setting Up the Mission
**  Section One:  In General Lincoln's Office
 Gyllian walked up the corridor in the Ministry of Defense.  The corridor had the nickname General's Row.  She hoped one day to have an office here, but that had not happened yet.  She always wondered why.  She had already done some amazing things: Solved the riddle of the Bermuda Triangle, negotiated with the Republic of Space, encountered the frog people, unmasked agents working against the Alliance of Planets, made sense of the toxic site known as the Landscape of Thorns and followed the trail of human beings missing since the War of the Second Expansion not to mention much more mundane work in the field of intelligence.

Today she was going to a conference with General Lincoln.  She did not know the nature of the conference.  She hoped it would mean her promotion from Colonel to General.

She opened the door to the conference room.  Despite all the advances of human beings over many millennia in the exploration of space and the settlement of a large part of the galaxy, conference rooms continued to look much the same, table and chairs with viewing screens built into the table.  Maybe the same design was because human beings continued to be designed in the same way.  The uncanny valley made sure that human beings could not differ much in looks from themselves and still look normal.  The Institute of Genetic Design knew that, too.  The ungendered Pantherans used to perform most tasks looked more or less like gendered ones Gyllian was told.  Anything else would be too weird to contemplate.

"Please sit down, Colonel," General Lincoln said, not rising from his position on the other side of the table.

Gyllian sat and waited for General Lincoln to speak.

"We have been considering your report about the Confederation of Three Planets.  It was quite a surprise to learn that human civilization exists in an unsettled area of the western spiral galactic arm.  Although it is quite some actual distance from Coalition space and the areas settled outside Coalition space, we wondered why there is not much colonization going on out there."

The general paused to see if Gyllian wanted to make a comment.  The comment Gyllian wanted to make was, What took you so long to read the report?  She decided this would be seen as impudent on her part and so she said, "I do not know why precisely, but one possibility, and it is only speculation on my part, is that another race once occupied that area and is no longer there as far as we know.  our encounter with Prince hat suggests there might have been other races who have succumbed to the pressures of time."

"A most curious business," the general said, dismissing the topic.  "The point is, Colonel Romeres Lujo, the Alliance of Three Planets exists.  We want you to formulate a plan to bring them into an alliance with the rest of humanity. I am sending you the particulars of the mission now.  Assemble your team and report back when you have achieved this objective.  My staff is available if you have any questions.  That will be all."

And there she was, descending in the elevator tube to her office.  Definitely no promotion.  She was clever and adventurous, but she still would not be given a chance to move into the inner circle.  She was a rogue, good at solving a certain kind of puzzle that needed solving, but not the sort of person the higher ups wanted around, making decisions for the Alliance as a whole.  They would tout her successes to make the ministry look forward thinking and creative, but when it came to actually defending their interests, the Ministry of Defense was happy to send her off on a wild goose chase.

Her secretary smiled at her when she entered the office.

"Everything go well upstairs?" he asked, fishing for details.

"A new mission," Gyllian replied.  "I will let you know what you need to do to set it up."

Sam was crestfallen.  He hoped she would get the call to General's Row, too, because she would take him with her.  She and Sam had been together since she rated a secretary.

"Reports are in your queue," Sam added.

Gyllian went into her office and read quickly through the additional reports, checking some off, sending others back with comments, assigning new work.  She was putting off looking at the new assignment General Lincoln had given her.  Something told her it would be problematic.

When her desk was clean, figuratively speaking, she opened the file.  It was worse than she had feared.

**  Section Two:  The Scope of the Mission
It was bad.  In fact, it was terrible.  As General Lincoln had outlined, her objective was to bring the Alliance of Three Planets into the cooperative relationship of the Alliance of Planets and The solar League.  She had freedom to act.  She had a limited budget.  She always had a limited budget.  She always overran her budgets and sooner or later all expenses were met.  She had been given no staff.  She had Sam, of course, but a terse note said,

>  You have demonstrated a willingness and success with non-military personnel.  You are strongly encouraged to make use of these  contacts in pursuit of this mission.

Non-military personnel.  Her superiors were thinking specifically of Captain Star Runner, the fuchsia-colored Pantheran....  Captain Star Runner had a starship, a rather advanced starship not to put too fine a point on things.  Star Runner's on again off again lover, Ronnie Camberwell, was working as a private investigator on Marathon itself.  The Czarina, a well-loved gossip blogger was already there along with her new flame, Captain William Kidd, a retired League of Hypatian Pirates official.  Josh Levins on, a security expert, had return to the Pharaoh Star System to conduct his business out of Ptolemy City.  That left Eberhard.  She would have to find out where Eberhard was now.  He did not typically stick around the Alliance of Planets much.  He was probably back in Ptolemy City, too.  The lack of laws there made it easy for him to operate as a hired assassin from time to time and to perfect his comedy sketch as Emily Dickinson.  He had some rough patches as a resident of Ptolemy City, but it was a forgiving place.

Gyllian sighed.  The first thing to do was to contact Star.  She gave Sam instructions.

"I have no idea where Captain Star Runner is," Gyllian told him.  "Just find him and tell him I need to speak with him."

"And if Captain Star Runner asks why, what should I tell him?" Sam asked.  Sam did not like speaking with the Pantheran free lance operator.  For one thing, Pantherans spoke to human beings in a breathy, high voice which had a tendency to produce a squeak that was hard on the ears.  Sam, like most human beings, had an almost genetic aversion to Pantherans.  They were the race that had the upper hand in the Coalition.  It was the desire to escape that upper hand, more accurately called the upper paw, that had brought Sam's family to the Northern Frontier in the first place.  Sam had joined the military to fight any encroachment of the Pantherans over the border.  In short, Sam did not like Pantherans.  He had never met Captain Star Runner.  Gyllian doubted he ever would.  Captain Star Runner might be an asset to the Ministry of Defense, but they would never admit it nor would they invite Captain Star Runner to their facility.

"Tell Captain Star Runner I need his expertise," Gyllian said.  "I will pay for that expertise.  Ask him if he can accommodate me."

With luck, Captain Star Runner would not be halfway to Half Moon Bay Space Station in the adjoining galactic arm.  Recently the fuchsia-colored Pantheran had returned from a highly profitable trip there.  With Captain Star Runner's exceptional ability to find his way through hyperspace, Star Runner had found a very expedient route which made regular visits back and forth feasible.

Now to contact Eberhard.  Her text was short and to the point:

>  Eberhard, can you work with me?

Eberhard called her five minutes later.

From her wet wire display, Gyllian saw tables and chairs with spacers talking, eating and drinking.  It looked familiar.

"Where are you?" she asked.

"Baker Street Lounge," Eberhard replied.

"On Dirty World Station?" she asked.

"The same," he replied.

"It looks the same," she said.

"It looks like it has not changed since the day it was fabricated," Eberhard said.  "I do not think the coffee pot has ever been emptied either.  I think I am drinking some of the coffee from the original pot."

"What are you doing there?" she asked, then said, "Never mind.  I do not think I need to know."

"You do not," Eberhard said.  "What do you need?"

"Intelligence," Gyllian said.  "Is this line secure?"

"As secure as I can make it," Eberhard said, "which is pretty secure if you ask me.  Noting is perfect, of course."

"Of course not," Gyllian agreed.  "Here is what I need.  I am to go back and talk to the people in the Confederation of Three Planets.  I know the Pantherans were trying to follow us there.  I need to know what they are doing, if anything, about finding out where we went and why.  I need to know what  they know and what they want to know."

Eberhard whistled softly.  "That is a tall order, Gyllie."

"I know.  But you have resources I do not.  You have ways of finding out information I do not."

"Agreed," Eberhard said.  "I can wander about, ask a few questions, and listen a lot."

"Good.  I need this information as soon as I can get it."

"Talking about the cats can lead to trouble," Eberhard observed.

"I know," Gyllian said.  "There is compensation, of course."

"Of course," Eberhard said and rung off.

Good.  That was done.  Without checking, the Alliance would not have anything.  She would have to ask her counterparts in The Solar League.  It was very dangerous for them to talk about certain subjects.  Pantheran surveillance was everywhere.  They pretended to be in the forefront of open and frank conversation between the different races of the Coalition.  Over time, everyone had learned the Pantherans used the Coalition to control other races.  They thought of themselves as ruling this part of the western spiral galactic arm.  They had been an out of the closet empire previously.  Now they used the myth of an open Coalition.

And they were good.  Despite everything, peace had prevailed.  All the races did not suffer interracial violence.  There were no external threats, at least right now.  The problem was, the Pantherans watched and listened.  Nothing was below their notice and they wanted everything done their way.  They intimidated their way to dominance.  It was a word here and a word there and a threat somewhere else.

Gyllian often wondered how they managed it.  She thought she knew Captain Star Runner well.  Star Runner was  many things, but Star Runner was gullible and easily manipulated.  She wondered how Star Runner's engineering varied from the military planners and the diplomats.  Star Runner was just that, someone who ran a starship, piloting it safely through hyperspace where ships could be easily lost and never return to normal space.

Sam stood in her office doorway.  He could have reached out and notified her through her wet wiring, but Sam always took opportunities to get out of his chair and move around.  Sam said, "Captain Star Runner is available to speak with you."

"Go ahead Star," Gyllian said.

The fuchsia-colored Pantheran appeared to her.  He was stretched out on his acceleration platform,.  A turquoise haze enfolded him.  This was the upgraded acceleration web.  No more hammock.  Gyllian was still not used to looking at Captain Star Runner through the haze.  She supposed it told her Captain Star Runner was underway.

"You had a business proposition for me," Captain Star Runner said.

To the point as always.  Captain Star Runner considered profit to be very important.  Maybe if she was so dependent on technology she literally could not live without it, Gyllian would be as concerned with money as Captain Star Runner was.

She said, "Yes, I have a mission with the Confederation of Three Planets.  I wondered if you would contract with me to take me there and provide whatever support you can."

"That is fairly nebulous," Captain Star Runner said.  "I understand passage to and from that star system."

"I do not know what I may be called upon to do there," Gyllian explained.  "I need a ship and a pilot.  Can you do that for me?"

"Am I a part of your mission?" Captain Star Runner asked.

"I cannot say for certain yet," Gyllian replied.  "It is still early days."

"Is the Empire involved?" Captain Star Runner asked.

"I do not know that either," Gyllian said.  "My instructions are to go to the Confederation of Three Planets and open up a dialog with them.  We would like them to interact with the rest of humanity."

"And why do you need my services?" Captain Star Runner asked.  "Why do you not have your own vehicle?"

A very good question, but Gyllian thought she knew the answer.

"A military vessel was not assigned," she said.  "My brief is to go there and employ the resources I think best to undertake this mission.  I believe that my superiors are telling me, indirectly of course, to ask you to be my star runner."

"And who else is involved in this mission?" Captain Star Runner asked.

"I have contracted with Emily Dickinson," Gyllian said, using Eberhard's alternate name, the one Star Runner used.

"Anyone else?"

"Josh Levins is back in Ptolemy City," Gyllian said.  "I do not know how I would involve him yet.  When I get to the Confederation of Three Planets I plan to contact The Czarina and Captain Kidd though I do not have a role for them yet."

"And Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell?" Captain Star Runner asked.  "What about her?"

"I do not have a role for a private investigator yet," Gyllian said.

Star Runner was silent.  Ronnie was his lover.  Gyllian and Ronnie did not see eye to eye.  If she was honest, Gyllian felt jealous of Ronnie.  She did not understand Star Runner's attraction and love for the woman.

Star Runner continued his silence.  This was unusual.  The Pantheran had not been as guileless as he once was especially after his return from the adjoining galactic arm.

"You would be free to interact with Ronnie as the mission permitted," Gyllian said.  "You would be working for me."

"It is my ride," Captain Star Runner said.

"Of course," Gyllian agreed.  "You can have whoever you want on board.  I just need to know you would be contracted with me."

"I will draw up a contract and send it to you," Captain Star Runner said.

"You are available immediately, right?" Gyllian asked.

"I can make myself available if you agree to the contract," Captain Star Runner said.

"Okay," Gyllian said.

Captain Star Runner broke the connection.

As usual, Star Runner's contract was very precise.  When compared against previous contracts, it was basically the same.  As captain, Star Runner reserved the right to only do things that safeguarded his vessel.  He also made it clear that the personnel aboard his vehicle had to be to his liking.  Gyllian had to accept these provisos.

**  Section Three:  The Confederation of Three Planets
Captain Star Runner met Gyllian at the Rock Island Line Diner on Grand Central Station.  It was good to be back together again eating at the diner.  Captain Star Runner already had a plate of his favorite foods in front of him.  His AI Christabel scolded him for eating these rich foods because she had to adjust his biochemistry after he ate, but Captain Star Runner delighted in macaroni and cheese with chocolate chip cookies and tapioca pudding with whipped cream  It was an odd meal, but everyone at the Rock Island Line Diner knew how much he loved it.  Captain Star Runner came into the diner often enough that the sight of a fuchsia-colored Pantheran did not upset anyone.  They knew he was a regular spacer who dropped in when his routes allowed it.  He was, in a real sense, their Pantheran Gyllian thought as she sat down across from him.  That made all the difference in the western spiral galactic arm.  Captain Star Runner was not threatening.  He was known and judged to be no different than any other independent operator running his ship to make deliveries thought the Alliance of Planets and beyond.  He was reliable and did not ask questions about his cargo.  Smugglers and legitimate businesses were willing to pay a high price for Captain Star Runner's services.  Being a Pantheran, he could withstand higher G-forces than humans could and he could insert and extract from hyperspace without a jump gate.  That meant he could move through hyperspace faster and therefore get goods to where they were going quicker than anyone else.  His limitation was that he refused to enter Coalition space, but making a regular run to Three Ravens on the Southern Frontier was no problem at all.

"Are we ready to go?" Gyllian asked.

"I have all the items you requested on board," Captain Star Runner replied.  "Christabel has put together an order for comestibles that will satisfy you and the Terries we know in the Confederation of Planets.  Based on the outline you sent me, I am concerned that you do not have a role for Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell.  I wonder if you are intentionally leaving her out of your plans."

That was a bold speech for Captain Star Runner, Gyllian thought.  He did not usually confront her like this.  Gyllian suspected Captain Star Runner and Christabel, the AI, had discussed the situation.  Christabel had written this speech and prompted Star Runner to make it.  It was a fair question.  She needed to allay his fears.  Star Runner was very protective of those he cared about.  Fortunately, he cared about everyone he knew in the Confederation of Three Planets which would make him a reliable pilot.

"I do not have a role in mind for her at this time," Gyllian said, "but rest assured if I need her I will call upon her investigative skills."

"She does have good skills," Captain Star Runner insisted.

Gyllian was not altogether sure about that.  Ronnie had disappointed her in the matter of the Landscape  of Thorns though she had been very useful to Tamara at The Big Dig.

"You are very loyal," Gyllian told the fuchsia-colored Pantheran.  "That is a great virtue."

Captain Star Runner was pleased.  Gyllian saw he did not recognize she had skirted his issue.  She wondered if she had fooled Christabel.  The AI was very protective of her charge.  The Fungusian Network which had designed her was far more discerning than Star Runner was.

When they were finished eating, they went aboard Captain Star Runner's ship and traveled to the Confederation of Three Planets.
----
The ship definitely needs a name.  I need to review the initial encounter when Captain Star Runner and company first meet the Confederation of Three Planets.  I also need to review the disposition of the company at the end of The Big Dig.
-----
Captain Star Runner collected messages when they arrived in the star system.
-----
The star system needs a name, too.
-----
There was one from Eberhard.

>  Gyllie, there is talk that the Pantherans are looking for extraction points in your sector.  I do not know why or anything else.  The chatter comes from reliable sources.
-----
This sector of space needs to be located relative to the other areas touching the Coalition.
-----
Later Gyllian would realize this information was disinformation put out by the Pantheran Empire.  They already knew where the Confederation of Three Planets was, how to access it and they had left messages there for many years.  The time was not right for them to act on the knowledge they had.
-----
"This extraction thing bothers me," Gyllian told Captain Star Runner.  "If they force the lock from the Pharaoh Star System, they can easily overpower anyone here."

"The thing to do is to map all the insertion and extraction points," Captain Star Runner said.  "Then we can go about locking them."

This seems like a good idea to Gyllian.  An organized approach to solving a problem satisfied her like nothing else.  In the meantime, she had to contact the Confederation of Three Planets and convince them they needed to be concerned about an imminent threat to their security.  By formerly joining with the rest of humanity, they would benefit by having other human beings willing to assist them if the unthinkable happened.  The Pantheran Empire had not moved against any other race since the War of the Second Space Expansion, but Gyllian and others in the Ministry of Defense and in The Solar League were concerned that this state of affairs could change at any time.
-----
I need to clarify the name of this ancient conflict and its nature.
-----
Many of the races in the Coalition scoffed at the human race for having this fear.  They considered them paranoid.  Gyllian thought they were naive.  Even the Fungusian Network was convinced the Pantherans would assert their hegemony soon.  They believed the Pantheran Empire would fall like so many others before them, but their estimates ranged into the tens of thousands of years.  They were well-organized and apparently all the members of the Race from the juvenile ungendered Pantherans to the most significant gendered ones were willing to subsume their own personal well-being to that of the whole.  Gyllian offered wondered how Captain Star Runner had overcome that genetic programming.  Maybe it was his fuchsia coloring.  Fuchsia-colored Pantherans were known to be unique.

When they arrived in the star system, Gyllian sent out messages to The Czarina, Captain Kidd and the Confederation of the Three Planets.  She had no way of contacting Ronnie Camberwell and besides, Gyllian had no intention of contacting the private investigator if she did not have to.  Captain Star Runner was extremely unhappy with this state of affairs.

"We will have to wait until we have a reason to go down to Capital City in The Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer," Gyllian insisted.  "She is posing as a regular member of their society.  We just cannot go charging in there and expose her as a person from outside their star system.  It would put her in great danger."

"You have contacted The Czarina and Captain Kidd," Captain Star Runner said.  "Your actions could endanger them, too."

"Their situation is different," Gyllian said.  If pressed, she had to admit to herself, the difference was in her own judgment, not in their situation, but Captain Star Runner did not press her.  She wondered why at the time.
-----
Don't forget to go back to this at the end of the novel.
-----
The Confederation of Three Planets was not happy she had returned to the star system.

"The Confederation's General Secretary wishes to advise the representative of the Alliance of Planets and The Solar League that this organization exists for the well-being of the three inhabitable planets of this star system and neither has the authority or desire to interact with governments and organizations outside its jurisdiction."

Gyllian frowned.  They were far too isolationist and parochial.  There was a whole galaxy out there that could drop in at any time.  She said as much to the functionary.

"We have managed our affairs in this way for five thousand years.  We see no reason to change our conduct now."

And that was the end of the transmission.  No amount of cajoling on Gillian's part even produced a response.

While she was pondering what to do next, a transmission came from The Czarina and Captain Kidd.

"Has anyone heard of anything about The Rebel Horde?  We keep hearing references to them but we are unable to pinpoint any specific information about this group.  It would help our research to learn more about them."

This was the key Gyllian was looking for.  This was why she had contacted The Czarina and Captain Kidd in the first place.  They were doing research for some blog posts The Czarina hoped to write in the future for human consumption.  She made her living as a gossip columnist.  Gossip about some here-to-fore unknown worlds was just the ticket that would boost her ratings.  She had done that previously when the most powerful person on Hypatia was indicted for corruption and murder.  She was always on the lookout for more sensational stories.
Gyllian sent another message to The Confederation of Three Planets, asking for anyone to contact her about The Rebel Horde.  She had information to share.  It was a bold move.  Her information was only that some of her operatives had encountered the term but she hoped someone would respond.  And someone did.
**  Meeting with Lord Stern
The message that the ship received was in text only.  Captain Star Runner thought the sender had spoofed his address of origin.  This supposition proved to be correct.  Christabel was able to track back to the office of one Lord Stern, the Confederation of Three Planet's representative from somewhere called The Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer.  Gyllian was excited.  This was one of the representatives she had met with when they first came to the star system.  Ronnie was living in Capital City, the main urban area of that  province.

Lord Stern wished to keep their communication as private as possible.  He knew the Confederation of Three Planets had refused Gillian's offer of assistance.  For his part, Lord Stern believed the Confederation of Three Planets as a whole was being short-sighted and foolish.

"But you see, Colonel Romeres Lujo," he wrote, "the province in the strongest position in our Confederation Council is that of the Royal Province of Barbara of Portugal, the largest and most powerful province.  If the Barbarans do not want something to happen, it does not happen.  They do not want to contact other members of the human race.  Their power would be greatly diminished if they did so.  They would not be equal partners with your illustrious Alliance of Planets or Solar League.  They would be seen as a handful of country bumkins and they want to maintain the fiction that they are an elite group of highly sophisticated individuals.

"For my part, I consider us vulnerable to attack from both outside our star system and from within.  I have heard of this Rebel Horde and I am concerned that they could and will undermine our current position."

*  Chapter One: The Message Placed by the Swan
**  Scene One:  In Ronnie's Dingy Third Floor Room at 202 Green Street, Capital City, The Royal Province of Debussy-on-La-Mer

I stare at the coals on the hearth in my dingy room on the third floor of my boarding house in the Rocky Bluff neighborhood of Capital City, in the royal province Debussy-on-La-Mer, Marathon.

Let me back up.  I know this makes no sense to my readers.  The planet Marathon is unknown in the Coalition or on any frontier, Southern or Northern or in the worlds that the League of Hypatian Pirates knows about  It one of three planets settled by a million or so refugees from the Wars of Expansion which happened five thousand years ago.  These are relatively large numbers and deal with events which happened a long time ago.  What is significant is that human beings escaped from Pantheran attacks to settle in a region of space where the Pantheran hegemony does not reach.

My readers know, from previous adventures, that I have been in a long-going relationship with an ungendered Pantheran, Captain Star Runner.  It has been a relationship with many ups and downs and consists mostly of long absences by Captain Star Runner whose business takes her far beyond the regular trade routes.  I have no idea where Captain Star Runner is at the moment and communication is not possible as Captain Star Runner, for complicated reasons, must work outside space where the Pantheran military can reach.

When I first met Captain Star Runner, I believed, as many human beings do, that the Pantherans are equal partners in the Coalition along with the Featherote Charm, the Solar League and a dozen other races.  Through Star I learned that the Pantherans still think of themselves as having an empire and use the Coalition as a ruse to promote cooperation among the races in the Galactic Western Arm.  It is more efficient and diminishes the need for a great deal of oversight.  The Fungusian Network knows better but keeps to itself as much as possible, selling its information and artificial intelligence systems to whoever can pay.

As I sit and stare in into the hearth with its dying coals and shiver against the coldness of my room, all these machinations seem very far away.  Everything about my life up until the time I came to Marathon seems very far away.  I was successful, financially secure and I used many conveniences brought about technological advances.  Currently I live in a dirty city which still uses horses to pull wagons for heaven sake.  There is no connectivity and no information.

The truth is, I am lonely, broke and I have no prospects for either condition to change.  I am near the end of my rope, a colloquial expression I once read in a book back when I lived in the Pharaoh Star System and I have no idea how to get out of this situation.  I do not even have someone to talk to about my situation.  I do not know that many people here.

I came to Marathon with a number of people.  Tamara's archaeological team and Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo went back to the Northern Frontier.  My friend Josh Levins decided it was safe for him to return to Ptolemy City. The Czarina and Captain William Kidd are off on a tour of Llondune Town, another planet in the Free Planets Alliance.  I have not heard from or about them since their departure.  They would have no way of knowing where I am.  If we meet again, it will probably be by chance.

And, as I have said, Captain Star Runner is off on another space adventure.

So, if you have-not figured anything else out already, I am on my own
and I have precious little to offer Capital City.

I have no idea how to be homeless.  Ptolemy City had homeless people,
people down on their luck.  There are no social programs to deal with
homelessness there.  But at least the city was kept at a comfortable
temperature under the dome.  No one would ever freeze to death.  All the others would never know what became of me.  I would be lost
to history.

I wonder how long it will be before I can see my breath in this drafty
room.  Mrs. Farnesworth will ask me for money when I bring my coal
bucket downstairs to put a few more pieces of coal into it for the
evening.  I have very little money left.  The truth is, I can spend my
money on coal to keep from freezing, but by the end of the month, I
will not have enough for another month's rent.  And there is the
matter of food.  Food is not included in my rent.  I am hungry.  I
have never been hungry in my life like I am hungry now.  In less than two week's time, I will be homeless, too, and it is winter here in
Capital City.  Where do the homeless go here?  

I physically shook myself.  Yes, my situation was desperate, but self
pity and over dramatization solves nothing.  I would buy a few more
pieces of coal, bring them back to my room, and then go out.  This
room would depress anybody.  I need to go to the Royal Gardens to
think.  It would be cold but I think better when I am walking.

**  Scene Two:  The second floor landing of 202 Green Street

Ronnie is seen dressed in her threadbare winter coat.  One sleeve is awkwardly patched at the elbow.  She has a scarf tied around her neck and a hat pulled down over her ears.  A knitted belt around her waist emphasizes that the coat is too big for her.  

Gwennore steps from her room and speaks to Ronnie.

"Going out again, are you?"

"Yes, Gwennore," I said.  "It is too cold to sit in my room."

"So you're walking in the royal gardens again, are you?"

Gwennore has an annoying habit of ending every sentence with "are you".

"Yes, Gwennore," I said.  "I am going to walk in the Royal Gardens to think."

"You know they can put thoughts in your head," Gwennore said.  "I'd be careful if I were you."

Two sentences with no "are you".  This must be a record.

I made to continue down the staircase.

"I wouldn't go on the island if I were you," Gwennore said.  "Mind my warning.  No good can come of it."

I was anxious to leave the house.  Gwennore is an odd person.  She has long white hair, dresses beautifully and always seems to be waiting for me when I am coming in or out of the house.  She always has a warning to impart, too.

I unlocked the front door preparatory to going out.  I could not wait.  Gwennore's dire warnings are another depressing aspect of living here at 202 Green Street.

I wanted to turn around, to deliver a retort.  "Whoever it is, she can have that awful room.  She can have you and Gwennore and Daniels who lives in the attic.  She can have all of you."  But I did not say anything.  I simply fled down Green Street.

"Remember your rent is due in five days," Mrs. Farnesworth said as I stepped out the door.  I had not seen her but she seemed to watch the front door the same way Gwennore watched the landing.  "Don't be late.  There is someone who wants your room."

**  Scene Three:  Walking Through Capital City to Get to the Royal Gardens

Capital City is dreary.  All the houses are stone, a red brown stone that is mined near the sea.  I have heard that the quarries fill up with salt water and the walls of these quarries collapse and the sea water rushes in, changing the contours of the coastline and, perhaps this is obvious to anyone who knows about the ocean, killing people.  People drown who have nothing to do with the quarries.  They just happen to be there.  The people working are drowned because they have to be there.  Animals and trees and all sort of living things die when the water rushes in.  I suppose some sea animals and plants like all of this.  I know nothing about the sea.  In fact, I have never seen an ocean up close.  On my home world of Hypatia, there are no seas with water in them.  Hypatia is cold, volcanic and with a poisonous atmosphere.  I lived under a dome and never worried that it might breech.  Thinking of the sea, I think I would worry all the time that I would be swept away.

I walk quickly.  I must cross the bridge over the river to reach the royal gardens.  It will be damp and feel much colder along the river, but it will be worth it to get to the gardens.Capital City, according to Captain Star Runner, is like an old Earth city in the late nineteenth century of the pre Solar League (PSL) period.  They use animals to pull wagons, carts, and carriages of all sorts.  Some of these vehicles are for hire while others are in private hands.  Some small vehicles are pulled by people on foot or on bicycles.  I walk because I have no money even for an omnibus.  

Smoke hangs heavy over the city.  Everyone burns coal and it is dirty.  It causes me to cough.  I was took the coal smoke can cause lung diseases that kill people.  I think sometimes I will die alone on these streets from one of these diseases.  I come from a place and a time where people usually live a long time and disease, which does exist, can often be treated.  After all, one of the premier medical centers exists in my star system.

But that is all behind me.  Now I must face the dirty air, the dirty streets, the cold and the horrible smells of manure, manufacturing and just the mass of unwashed humanity.  If I am truthful, I am one of this mass of smelly people and animals moving about Capital City.  Baths cost money and I have no money for bathing.

The Old Stone Bridge crosses the Afternoon of the Faun River near the Rocky Bluff neighborhood, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Capital City.  The other oldest neighborhood is Palace where presumably the royal family stayed on first arriving on Marathon.  It is hard to know because there are no public information centers in Capital City.  If I want to know something, I must go to an information keeper.  The information keepers decide if you have a need to know the information you are requesting.  When I first asked for information about the early history of the settlement of the Free Planets, I was given a physical book with the appropriate history lessons for school children.  When I asked for more information, I was told that I knew all I needed to know about this topic.  The book, of course, described a heroic band of pilgrims and many trials culminating in the founding of Capital City with lots of pictures of very important-looking people.  A brief history of the colonization of the royal province of Debussy-on-La-Mer was included with lots of soldiers, flags flying, demoralized prisoners and marching bands.  I wondered why, after so shortly arriving on a new world with lots of space the leadership found it necessary to engage in mortal conflict.  It reaffirmed the live-and-let-live policies I had grown up with on Hypatia.  Leadership, especially hereditary leadership, is greatly overrated as far as I am concerned.  Individuals can figure out what they need to do to survive and do it.
h
I paused to look over the low balustrade when I reached the midpoint of The Old Stone Bridge.  The River Afternoon of the Faun, known locally as The Faun, spread out below me.  Like Capital City, it was dirty and mean.  I doubted any life still remained in its murky depths.  Work boats and barges went by in both directions.  Some were rowed, others sailed, using the stiff wind for propulsion.  Only a few belched the ever present smoke of the city.  Capital City spread out before me as I was looking downstream.  Upstream The Faun is unnavigable by larger vessels.  The better establishments, fine homes and shops, lay along the river.  Delivery vessels call there as needed, but mostly the river is for pleasure craft.  The farther upstream you go, the finer the houses.  Across the river are the royal gardens, my destination.  Along the Faun on the other side stretched the high imposing walls of The Citadel.  The royal flag flapped in the wind on its summit.  This is the administrative heart of the royal province of Debussy-on-La-Mer.  I went there to ask for information.  The cathedral is there, the prison, the royal residence and, I have heard, even dungeons though Gwennore is my source for this intelligence and Gwennore is, as you have seen, a bit eccentric.

"Thinking of jumping?" a man asked.

I flinched.  He had startled me badly.  Quickly he shot a muscular arm in front of me.

"No," I said, stepping back from both the railing and his arm.  (Muscular?  How would Ronnie know.  Presumably he was dressed against the cold.  I need another way to describe the man as muscular.  I either have to have this story take place in warmer weather in which case Ronnie does not have to buy coal and is simply using the grate as something to stare at or I have to stick with the cold and describe people another way.  The cold is preferable because it precludes easy thoughts about living outside.  Living outside could simply be uncomfortable but more likely quite dangerous since freezing to death is an option.)

"Many people jump into The Faun during the winter," the man continued as if suicide is a casual topic for conversation with a stranger.  "It's a messy business, you know.  Although The Old Stone Bridge appears to be low, you would hit the river pretty hard.  It's more like jumping from a window of a building.  Drowning would be much more pleasant, but you'd have to wade into the river or slide off a boat."

I shivered violently.  The thought of the cold water producing an instinctual response.

"I see that does not appeal to you," the man said.

"I am fine," I said and turned away.

He said nothing more.

I walked quickly to the far side of the bridge.  I did not turn to see if he was following me.  What reason had he to do that?  Yet his presence near me on the bridge unsettled me.  I was only looking.  How would he know how desperate my life was at this moment?  I had never considered suicide.  I cannot say it was from any sense of wrongdoing.  It simply seemed like giving up and I was not about to give up.  There must be a way out of my predicament.  I only  needed to find it.  And wasn't that I was doing, going to the Royal Gardens to think and, in a burst of optimism, to craft a survival plan?

**  Scene Four: The Island in the Middle of the Lake
I was alone as I trudged against the wind toward the Royal Gardens.  In the distance I saw several people with their dogs.  I did not go in their direction.  I made my way inland, away from the river, toward the lake.  My sense is that the lake is human made.  I cannot< imagine a lake so near a river, but what do I know about such things.  The lake at home is artificial though the river is not.  It, however, is toxic, not from pollution but from its environment.  All of Hypatia is toxic to oxygen-breathing life forms.

I climbed the hill and there, spread out before me, was the lake.  I seemed to be the only one in this part of the vast preserve.  I stood still and breathed great gulps of fresh air.  This far from the river, fresh air was the norm.  I felt alive for the first time today.

I am becoming accustomed to the open sky of Marathon, to clouds and wind and rain.  I am told it will snow soon.  All this is unknown on my home world.

I looked for the swans.  Perhaps they were on the other side of the island.  They are special to the royal family and cannot be killed under penalty of death.  Why anyone would kill a swan is beyond me.  Of all the wildlife I have ever seen, I think I like swans the best.  I like to watch.  I do not want to get close to them.

I picked my way down the steep side of the hill.  I wonder if it, too, is artificial.  Perhaps the steep climb and descent discourages people from coming here.  There are no pavilions, no vendors.  Only a few benches afford a visitor a place to sit.  I have never seen a boat on the lake.  I wonder if they are allowed.

There is a narrow foot bridge to the island.  It is so close to the water no boat could pass this way.  I crunch gravel underfoot as I make my way along the island shoreline.  I will follow this path all around the island.  Perhaps, if I have time before it gets dark, I will take one of the paths inland, but I doubt I will have time for that.  If I walk all the way around the island, I will find some of the swans.

I came here to think, but as I walk, I find myself not thinking but living in the moment.  This is such a restorative place that I do not want to bring my problems to its tranquility.  Yet I know I need to decide what to do.

"No," I thought, "I do not need to decide anything."  

I know I want to leave 202 Green Street.  I want to leave Gwennore's madness.  I want to leave Daniels' secretiveness and well, creepy factor.  I want to leave Poppy Farnesworth's open hostility toward me.

I am not from the Royal Province of Debussy-on-La-Mer and therefore Mrs. Farnesworth considers me a foreigner.  And Mrs. Farnesworth does not like foreigners.  I have never told her I come from another star system.  That would make me a foreigner to some power of ten I cannot imagine.  I simply said I was from elsewhere and refused to answer all her questions and respond to all her insinuations.  She has decided I come from the Democracy of Rock and Roll which, in her mind, is the most scandalous place she can think of.  As the Democracy of Rock and Roll is on another continent on the other side of the planet, I have left this inaccuracy alone.  Why not be from a scandalous place.  Mrs. Farnesworth would probably think Ptolemy City is scandalous and if I told her about Captain Star Runner, well, I would certainly not be allowed to stay.  I would be consorting with the enemy.  Although the people of the Federation of Three Planets escaped from Pantheran domination five thousand years ago, you would think they were actively fighting the Pantherans still.  That might be true if the Pantherans found out where they are, but Captain Star Runner assures me the hyperspace insertion points are secure.  I have to take her word for this.

Then I come around a corner and stop quite still.  There in front of me is a swan, a dead swan, lying across the path, its beautiful white feathers soaked in blood.

I know the swan is dead, but I still go to it.  How did this happen?

My police training takes over.  I want to know who did this and why?  It is clear by the swan's cut throat no predator killed the swan.  This was a deliberate act by a human being.  Who murders a swan and why?  Besides being illegal, what purpose does it serve?  The swan was minding its own business in a lake probably created for swans to live in.  

And then I see it, a piece of paper affixed to a stick stuck into the ground.  It says,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    What we did to your swan we will do to the entire royal family and all your minions.
    You are just like the swan--ornamental.  You serve no purpose.
    You have been warned.
    The Unwashed Rebel Horde
#+END_QUOTE

This could not be a joke.  I was positive about that.  But who were The Rebel Horde and why did they think killing a swan and placing its body on an obscure path on the island in the lake of the Royal Gardens would telegraph their grievances to the population of the Royal Province of Debussy-on-La-Mer?  And did they think all the royal family and everyone who worked for them would get the message?  I doubted it.

The dead swan destroyed the peaceful and tranquil atmosphere on the island.  I turned around and hurried away.  If I had continued my walk around the island, I wonder if things would have turned out differently.
*  Chapter Two:  The Royal Summons

**  Scene 5: A Royal Summons Comes to 202 Green Street

I did not have much to pack, some just some clothes I had bought when I arrived in Capital City.  I had a few things from Ptolemy City.  I packed them carefully.  I stared at my credentials for private investigation.  I had thought to make that my profession when I settled here, but I discovered no one wanted to use a private investigator.  Private investigator collect information.  Collecting information is dangerous.  I would be in competition with the Royal Information Keepers and, basically, that is illegal.  So the thing I knew how to do is illegal here.  I do not know much of anything else and any inquiries I have made for employment have been rebuffed.  I am, after all, a foreigner.  I do not know how this happened, but like Mrs. Farnesworth, everyone think I come from the Democracy of Rock and Roll which makes me, for all intents and purposes, untouchable.
I was closing my bag when a forceful knocking began at my door.  This was strange.  No one knocked at my door.  Both Daniels and Gwennore interacted with me on the landings.  Mrs. Farnesworth watched the front door.  No one came to my door.  The knocking persisted.

I stepped to it.  Should I ask who was there?  The pounding continued.  This person would not go away.

I opened the door.

An Area Boy faced me.  These are typically young men who run in packs and threaten people.  They back off if they are given money.  Pinned to his dirty shirt was a Claude pin.  This must be n official visit.

"You Ronnie Camberwell?" he asked.

"Yeah," I said.

"This is for you," he said and shoved a document into my face.  Then he left.

I stepped back from the doorway and closed my door.  Then I looked at the document.  It was definitely an official document.  

"Bring this with you when you appear at the Palace.  Come immediately."

A royal summons.  Why?  Should I be worried?  Did this have anything to do with the dead swan?  That was the day before yesterday.

I reached for my coat.  There was nothing for it.  I had to go.



Gwennore met me on the stairs.  Of course she had seen the Area Boy coming and going.

"So you're off to the Palace are you?" she asked.

""I have no choice," I said, planning to brush right past her.

""You    want to be a sheep sent to the slaughter, don't you now."

///this was more statement than question.

"I was lawfully summoned," I said..  "If i did not go, I would be a fugitive and a criminal."

That may or may not have been true.  I certainly consider myself a law-abiding person.  Admittedly, I come from a world where there are few regulations and where murder and mayhem are commonplace.

"Be warned," Gwennore said, "they can put thoughts in your  mind there and not everybody comes home who goes there."

As crazy as this sounded, this may be the  most coherent thing Gwennore had said to me.  I shivered as I went down the next flight of stairs and not from the chill of the house.

"Mind the rent is due tonight if you want to stay," Mrs. Farnesworth said as I opened the front door.

I wanted to say I was never coming back, but then I remembered my carry bag on the bed and Gwennore's warnings.  I held my tongue.

**  Scene 6:  Responding to the Summons at the Palace

I proceeded to the Palace as quickly as I could.  I was not anxious to go inside per Gwennore's warnings, but I was also curious and cold.  The wind was blowing steadily.  It felt so much colder and I had no idea where I was going when i collected my bag and left 202 Green Street.  Maybe there would be someone at the Palace to advise me.  Maybe an Information Keeper could tell me what became of the homeless.  I had never seen a homeless person in Capital City come to think of it.  They must go somewhere.  Maybe, i thought, with a certain amount of gallows humor, being kept at the Palace overnight wouldn't be so bad.

I went through the large gateway with its huge gates standing open and very official-looking folks standing on either side, and looked around the large courtyard.  I spotted the the flag for the Information Keepers.  I showed them my document. At first the Information Keeper smile at me, but when she read my document, her manner became somber.  Quietly she directed me to an inconspicuous doorway near her booth.  My stomach clenched.  This was not a simple matter.  Maybe there was some truth behind what Gwennore always said.

I knocked on the door.  It was locked.  I waited.  A panel in the door slid open.  I showed my document.  The window slid shut and the door creaked open.  I walked through.  No one was there to greet me.  I wondered who opened the door.  I wondered who looked at the document.

I was in a long stone corridor.  Torches lighted my way.  There seemed nothing to do but to walk forward.  I came to another locked door.  Before knocking, I looked back.  I could no longer see the entrance door.  One by one, each torch was extinguished but how this was happening I could not say.  I realized, if the process continued, I would be standing in the dark soon.  I knocked on the door.  I heard a clicking sound.  Quickly I reached for the door handle and pulled it open.

To my astonishment, I stepped into a  lighted room much like any in Ptolemy City.  In one step I had moved from a period on Old Earth to the modern day.

The only person occupying this ante chamber, for I could see immediately that the room was small, was the man who had spoken to me on the Old Stone Bridge, the one who had asked me if I was planning to jump.

"Hello, Ms. Camberwell," he said.  "We are expected.  Please follow me."

Bewildered, I followed him through yet another door, and into a busy corridor.  I was walking past offices where people interfaced with all the modern conveniences I knew at home.  Finally, we passed through yet another door into a conference room.  Several people awaited us.

** Scene 7:  A Meeting with the Queen


"Please sit down," the man at the other end of the table said.  "I am Lord Stern."

His appellation fit him.  I thought, "Here it comes.  Whatever I have done, things are not going to go well with me."

"You are here," Lord Stern continued, "because of the death of a royal swan."

I was thunderstruck.  I had not killed the swan.  I only saw the swan dead on the path.  I said as much to Lord Stern.

He said, "Then can you explain to me why your name was found near the swan's body?"

He produced no evidence.

"No," I said, "I never saw anything with my name on it, only the note signed by The Rebel Horde."

"And you have no association with this body?" Lord Stern asked.  Dare I say he asked me sternly?

"No," I  said.  "I did not proceed past the swan.  If my name was there, I did not place it there."

"And this does not belong to you, then?"

Lord Stern produced a small case.  I recognized it immediately.  Captain Star Runner had purchased it for me and had my name inscribed on it.  Of course it said "Detective Ronnie Camberwell" because that is what Star called me.  I was a police officer at the time.  I wondered where the little case came from.  I had not brought it with me to Marathon.  For all I knew, it was still sitting in a box in my flat in the Womyn's Cooperative back in Ptolemy City.

"This is my case," I said very slowly, "but I did not bring it to Capital City with me."

I wondered exactly what these people knew about my past, who I was, and that I came from outside their star system.  I was fairly confident they knew all this.  The modernity of their offices suggested the Royal precinct operated differently than the rest of Capital City.

-----
I need to work out the military arrangements for patrolling the space or at least the extraction point or points for the three planets.  To have working spaceships, there has to be a place where they are built and manufacturing to support the building of the spaceships and the training of the personnel.  How do the disparate governments on the settled planets interact to do this.  I suppose they could cooperate enough to have a land mass where this is done away from the backward other areas.  How did this come about?  In part as a practical manner, I am sure.  There was not enough resource or expertise on the first ships that came to this space and they had to recreate their society and keep people from starving or killing each other off.  But why doesn't the society progress?  Is this a function of the high ups who can manage the masses more effectively if they are kept technologically backwards.  Additionally, does this keep them more hidden from the Coalition?  That seems a likely possibility and a way to explain what is going on.  The richer people in Capital City keep information about the Royal Precinct quiet to protect their own interests.  Severe penalties must accrue if any of them share too widely.  The death penalty and torture must be in effect here.  A nasty business.
-----"So you are saying you had nothing to do with placing your case near my dead swan," the only other woman in the room said.

Was this the queen?  She looked nothing like any pictures I had ever seen of her.  But she had said "my swan".

"No, ma'am," I stammered.  What a fool I was making of myself.  "I was horrified to see the dead swan.  I enjoy going to the island in the lake and seeing the swans there."

I was babbling.  Surely this was not a good sign.

I kept looking at the woman.  She was young, not old like the pictures.

"Victoria is the public face of royalty," the woman said.  "I am the Royal Province of Debussy-on-La-Mer's queen, but my name is not Victoria.  However, for public consumption, I am old, widowed and called Victoria."

"Yes, ma'am," I repeated, feeling awkward and dull-witted.  I was continually blindsided by what went on behind closed doors in this city.

"Teddy," Lord Stern said, turning to the man who had escorted me into the conference room.  "Can you comment?"

"I have no testimony to give," the man called Teddy said.  "I stayed on the hillside to use the woods as cover."

Then Teddy followed me that day.  Why?

"Teddy," the queen explained, "is your Shadower."

"Shadower?" I repeated.  What was a shadower?

"We employ many people to shadow persons of interest," Lord Stern informed me.  "As you see, surveillance cameras would be problematic."

Indeed.

"So you employ people to follow other people around," I said, "like private investigators."

"A similar concept," Lord Stern said, "but they are more akin to police officers than private investigators.

"You are of interest to us, Ms. Camberwell," Lord Stern continued.  "We were shocked to find your case near the rebel declaration.  Teddy had not reported anything unusual about your habits and your associates.  We wondered, of course, if you had co-opted him, but we are satisfied that you have not."

Thanks for small favors, I thought.

"But we still have the matter of my dead swan," the queen said.  "Lord Stern, how can this matter be resolved."

"I am doubtful, Your Majesty," Lord Stern said, "that Ms. Camberwell killed your swan, but as there are no witnesses that she did not kill your swan, I am unwilling to recommend the death penalty."

Death penalty.  I had not realized this was a trial and that sentence could be passed.  I did not know that my answers would determine whether I lived or died.  No charges had been formerly brought.  I had no counsel.  Surely this was barbaric and very unfair.  Gwennore's warnings came to mind.  Maybe people disappeared all the time.  Maybe that was why there were no homeless people around.  Maybe they just executed them daily.  I began to shiver again.

"The penalty must be satisfied," the queen answered.

This was a conversation that included neither me nor the shadower, Teddy.

"I have an alternate proposal," Lord Stern advised her.

"Tell me," the queen said, leaning forward.

"It regards another matter," Lord Stern said.

The queen slapped her hand on the table.  "Lord Stern, mind the death of my swan."

"I am, Your Majesty," Lord Stern said with exaggerated patience as if he was speaking to a petulant child and perhaps he was.

"I have been looking into the matter of The Rebel Horde.  Your Majesty will remember a notice was found by the body of your swan.  In my humble opinion, the swan's death and this notice are related.  Because her case was found by the swan's body, I believe Ms. Camberwell is somehow related to both the notice and the swan's death.  I don't know how yet, I confess, but I propose she and the shadower be directed, under my authority, to find out.  If they can adequately explain how these three things, the note, the case and the swan are related, they will be removed from Royal Suspicion.  Otherwise, their lives will be forfeit.  Is that acceptable to you, Your Majesty?"

Now I was shaking violently and I clasped my hands tightly together.  I was under a death sentence now and I had nothing to do with the swan's death or the notice or even my case's appearance, all the way from Ptolemy City.  This was outrageous.

I did not speak.  It was not because I was exercising any prudence in the matter.  I did not speak because my throat was so dry and tight I did not think I could have spoken if anyone asked me to speak which of course they did not.

"Do whatever you think best, Lord Stern," the queen said, rising to her feet, "I am only interested in finding my swan's killer."

"With all respect, Majesty," Lord Stern said, "I think you would be wise to take warnings from this organization seriously."

"No way," the queen said.  Her tone was childish.  "You and my brother can figure all that out.  I just want someone to pay for my swan's death."

And with that she flounced out of the room by a different door than I had used to enter.
**  Scene 8:  Prince Hollis's Plan
Lord Stern sighed, then collected himself.


A young man entered the room from yet another door and sat opposite from where the queen had sat.

"Well, Stern, how did it go?" he asked.

"With poor grace, Your Royal Highness."

The young man sighed.  He turned to me.  "Ms. Camberwell," he said, "I am Hollis, the queen's brother."

"Prince Hollis runs the government," Lord Stern explained.  I was impressed.  Lord Stern dained to explain something to me.

"Hollin enjoys playing her part," Prince Hollis continued, "but she cannot see reason when it comes to the swans.  Otherwise she is a fair and rational person with many gifts and more than my equal in many important ways."

Lord Stern looked like he had eaten a very sour piece of fruit.

"What I am interested in," Prince Hollis continued, speaking to me, "is getting to the bottom of this matter.  You did not bring this case with your name on it to Capital City, more specifically, to this part of space."

Okay.  Everyone in this room knows I am from the Pharaoh Star System or at least that I am from outside of their region of space.  That is a relief.  I can speak freely, at least about this matter.

"As far as I know, the case should be back at my flat in Ptolemy City," I said.

"And Captain Star Runner would not have brought it to you?" Prince Hollis asked.

Okay.  He lows about Star and probably that Star is a Pantheran.

"I have not seen Captain Star Runner since my initial arrival on Marathon," I said.  "As far as I know, she is off on one of her space voyages."

"I see," Prince Hollis said.
-----
Ronnie will need to refer back to this point.  This is the first information Prince Hollis holds back from her.  I need to think more about Prince Hollis's motives and goals.
-----

I stared at the prince.  Events were moving quite quickly.  Apparently I had escaped execution today and now, whether I liked it or not, I was finding a way to avoid execution in the future.  Well, I had wanted a job and saving my own life was as good a job as any.  I could not tell yet if my inevitable fate would be execution no matter what I did.  The longer I stayed alive the better.

To answer the prince's question though.  I knew so few people in the city.  

"Gwennore," I said.  Gwennore was a crazy person, but she had rightly figured out what was happening to me.  Maybe her insight would be helpful.

"Gwennore," Prince Hollis said her name thoughtfully.

"A resident at Ms. Camberwell's boarding house," Teddy said.  "She has been a frequent resident at the asylum."

"An odd choice," Prince Hollis said to no one in particular, "but allowed under the statute.  Gwennore will be advised of her civic responsibility."

"You have two weeks to produce results," Lord Stern told me.  "I will authorize payment of your rent and some living expenses.  I understand you have no resources."

They certainly knew a lot, a lot more than I did.  I wondered, with a death sentence hanging over me, if I would make any progress at all.  And with a shadower always at my heels, I wondered if escape was possible.

"If you fail," prince Hollis said,, "sentence will be carried out."  He smiled.  His smile was neither friendly nor sinister.  "It is unfortunate that your friends are all off-planet.  They could have been useful to you." He push back his chair and rose, walking to the door.  "I wish we had met under other circumstances, Ms. camberwell.  I would have liked to chat with you about other worlds, but unfortunately, I doubt we will have the opportunity."

*  Chapter Three:  Answer to My First Set of Questions
**  Scene 9:  Our First Meeting at the Green Street Tea room
We could not gather at Mrs. Farnesworth's house in one of our rooms.  Mrs. Farnesworth did not allow gentlemen callers, as she called them, upstairs.  I wondered why Daniels was even allowed to rent a room in her house, but according to Gwennore, Daniels had lived there for some time.  How Gwennore knew this I had no idea.  How Gwennore knew anything was a mystery to me.  I did not know her comings and goings and how she supported herself.

To my surprise, Gwennore was neither surprised nor disturbed by my explanations of her involvement in my investigation..  This may have been due to the fact that she was compensated for her time...  In the Rocky Bluff neighborhood, any money cold only be a good thing.

Mrs. Farnesworth practically snatched a month's rent from my hand.  her only icy remark was that I could have told her I was intending to stay another month.  i again did not respond with what I was thinking..  If I had a choice, i would have moved out, but looking for other lodging seemed a waste of time with a death sentence hanging over me.

 
Teddy explained to us that in his position as shadower, he was responsible for following me and passing along what information we gathered.  he was also the one who dispensed funds.  I was responsible for clearing my name.  Gwennore could assist me in all legal endeavors.  

"Is there any information on The Rebel Horde?" I asked.  "Any fingerprints?  Any footprints?  Any anything?"

"I was not given any information of this type," Teddy informed me.

"You think a shadower is going to give  away any information?" Gwennore said.  "They collect it.  They don't disperse it."

I considered this.  Clearly Teddy was a minder and not much else.

"So," i said, "you and Lord Stern and Prince Hollis have no interest in really finding out who The Rebel Horde is."

Both Teddy and Gwennore looked at me askance.

"Now don't you go speaking those names out loud," Gwennore scolded.  "If you must talk about them, Stern and Hollis will do very well."

The Victoria Effect, I thought.  Everything must be played as if old Queen Victoria was real.  The lords and ladies of the realm probably were not real either.   There was the real royalty and nobility and the public royalty and nobility.  Why there was such a disparity I could not say..  It made my head ache even to think about it.  I did not  have all that much time.  But I needed to focus on my investigation.

Teddy shrugged.  "My responsibility is to shadow you  and account for the money."

"I still need to know if the higher ups want this solved."  I wanted to understand if my energy needed to go in the direction of investigating The Rebel Horde or figuring out how to avoid my imminent death.  I did not even know how executions were carried out here in the Royal Province of Debussy-on-La-Mer, whether they were public or private.  I shivered just at the thought.  Maybe I could plead for leniency.  Maybe banishment was an option.  Captain Star Runner had not been gone long enough to be able to come and  rescue me as she had done  when I got mixed up in The Big Dig.

I turned to Gwennore.  "Do they care about The Rebel Horde?" I asked, wondering if I would get a straight answer from her on such an important question to my investigation.  How had I ever thought she would be helpful to me?



Gwennore also shrugged.  "And how would I be knowing that?" she asked.  "For all I know, Hollin herself wrote the note."

I went cold inside.  It never occurred to me that I might have been setup.  I am, after all, a foreigner, a person from another planet.  Perhaps Hollin enjoyed torture.  Many people, particularly in power, do.  With all my compatriots gone, I was a likely target.

"OK," I said.  "I am going to make several assumptions from the beginning:

"1.  The Rebel Horde exists.
"2.  It is a danger to the government.
"3.  We have the ability to find out who they are.
"4.  Finding out who they are will commute my death sentence."

No reaction.

"Comments?" I said.

Both Gwennore and Teddy remained silent.  I did not even think Teddy was listening to me.

I slammed my hand on the table hard.  Our cups of tea rattled in their sauces.

"Are either of you two listening to me?"

Teddy shrugged again.  I decided he, as he had said, was only interested in performing his assigned duties.  The Rebel Horde was of no interest to him at all and finding them, or not finding them, did not affect either his livelihood or his life.

I turned to Gwennore.  She was using her finger to draw in the spilled tea on the table.

I was about to scold her, to tell her what I thought of her indifference and then I paused.  Why should Gwennore care either about The Rebel Horde or me?  What reason could I give her for caring about either the government or me?  She would earn a stipend whether we succeeded or not.  Her life was not on the line.  I needed to find answers to my own questions.  The other two were just weight I had to carry around with me.

Then I relaxed.  Fine.  I was free to do as I liked unless either one of them prevented me from acting, for example, refusing to give me money or physically restraining me.

"Do you have paper?" I asked Teddy, "and something to write with?"

He produced both from his bag.

A notebook, a spiral-bound notebook and a pen.  I had read about such things.  Mrs. Parge had even insisted I know how to use them.  I pulled the notebook to me and rewrote my list.

1.  Find out who The Rebel Horde is.
2.  Find out if any other investigations are ongoing about them.
3.  Find out if there is any forensic information at the scene of the death of the swan.

I paused to think if there was anything else I needed to find out right away.

4.  Find out what happens if I receive the death penalty.

The words "find out" stood out.  I underlined them.

To find out anything here in Capital City, as far as I could tell, meant going to the Information Keepers.

I got up from the table.

"I'm going to talk with the Information Keepers.  Come with me if you like." I announced.

"Required to come," Gwennore said.

Teddy said nothing but rose.

Together, with me in the lead, setting the pace, we left the tea room.
**  Scene 10:  Back At the Information Keepers Kiosk
I strode confidently across the Old Stone Bridge and entered the Royal Precincts.  Despite my desperate situation, it felt so good to be purposeful again.

The same woman I had spoken to earlier was present at the kiosk.   She frowned when I posed my questions.

"I cannot give you this information," she said and was turning away.

"I have an investigation given to me by the highest authority," I said, recalling my tone and attitude from my police officer days.  "I need this information to complete my investigation in a timely manner."

I had the feeling no one had ever so ken to this woman in this way.  She froze.  I was not sure if I could use royal names here, but my implications were clear.  I stood resolutely in front of her, unwilling to leave, unwilling to accept anything but the information I sought.

"This will take some time," she finally said.

"How much time?" I asked.  "I do not have time to spare."

"Yes, I realize that," she said and looked down.  "I have to get authorization."

"How can I help to get you that authorization?" I asked.

"You need to get that authority you mentioned to authorize it," she said.

I turned to Teddy.  "That's your job," I said.  "I will wait here for you."  I looked meaningfully to the closed door I had entered in the morning.

"I'm not supposed to leave you," Teddy said.  His reluctance was obvious.

"I am here in the Royal Precincts," I said.  "Isn't there someone here who can prevent me from leaving until you get back?"

Apparently, this request was new to him.  He considered it with all deliberate speed, then, shrugging, he approached the door.  It opened and he went in.

Gwennore said, "And you're a fool if you linger here."

"Perhaps," I said, "but I will not get far if I leave now.  Besides, I think I want the answers to my questions."

Whatever Teddy said or did, the information came within minutes.  The woman at the Information Keepers Kiosk was quite taken aback.  I don't think anyone ever went about getting information in this manner before.

"Do you work here every day?" I asked.

"Yes," she said.

"What is your name?" I asked.

"Emma," she said altogether shily.

"Good," I said.  "Emma, I will need more information.  I will come to you for it."

Again the shock.

"You have proven very cooperative and helpful," I said. "I would like to be able to recommend you when this investigation is completed."

Emma did not believe me.

I gathered up my papers and left, my entourage coming after me.

We returned to the Green Street Tea room.

** Scene 11:  What the Information Keepers Gave Me

I decided to see if my royal stipend worked.  After we crossed The Old Stone Bridge, I went to the first omnibus stop.  As I hope, Teddy provided the fare for each of us.  He sat is the first available seat and sighed deeply, wiggling his feet is obvious pleasure at being off of them.  Although he had been following me around on foot, I did not usually do this much walking, and certainly not at this quick pace, every day.  I, too, was grateful to ride.  For her part, Gwennore seemed indifferent to the exercise.  I never knew her to be out of her room, but what did I know.  I had never paid much attention to her except when she waylaid me on the stairs.

We reentered the tea room.  As we spent a great deal of time here, I should probably tell you a bit about the place.

-----
It's been a year since I wrote a novel.  During Camp Nanowrimo, 2013, I worked on the Raspberry Pi blog.  Now I'm back to noveling.  It is so hard.  I don't seem to have the energy to write when I come home.  I feel tired all the time.  The ideas are there, I just have to reach farther for them.  For example, Ronnie has just returned with a pile of information from the Information Keepers.  What will she find?  Yes, there's information about The Rebel Horde and about the crime scene, but what does it say?  The information about her own situation is quite grim.  Ronnie is scared. I need to find better ways to talk about that.

I'm also inking a lot about the ending.  It's the middle that's hard and at this point in the novel, I'm not even past defining the problem. There's a lot of middle to write.

Hey, it occurs to me that the ending I had in mine could be brought forward.  Suppose discovering who The Rebel Horde is becomes a bigger mystery than it appears to be.  Star and Gyllian are involved here.  Ronnie is pissed off when she discovers their involvement.  Instead of finding this out at the end and leaving its resolution for a future novel, why not make it a part of this one?  There's a lot of energy there and I'm always comfortable writing about these two characters.  Writing about them flows well though I enjoy Ronnie, too, which is why I starting writing about her in the first place.  I did not want to lose her.  But there's real tension between her and Gyllian and if I put Star in a difficult position, I can write about Star, too, and I haven't had a chance to visit with Star at this stage of Scar's development for a long time.  If I bring them in, I'll have a chance to bring The Czarina and Captain Kidd in, too, and there's humor there.  I need some sort of back story for Gwennore as well.  Teddy is a bored government worker.  Is there any more to him?  I thought he would be the irritant for Ronnie, but he's just a plodder.  That might be his irritation to Ronnie if I can liven him up a bit.  There's way too much pushing the plot forward right now and not enough character development.  I stopped to think about the tea room to try to flesh out Capital City a bit more.  I need to find a way to involve Mrs. Farnesworth and Daniel's as well though I have a general idea how they fit in.  Is Gwennore the sleeper here?  Is she and Farnesworth and Daniels part of The Rebel Horde or are they just the way into the real workings of The Rebel Horde?  

I need to get up river, too, into the gated communities of those who work in the Royal Precincts.
-----

The Green Street Tea Room is a dingy place.  
It is not just the dirty windows that do not let in much light.  It is not just the staff which seems loathe to serve anyone who comes into the tea room.  it is not just the tables with their unbused dishes.  It is all of this and the defeated air of everyone who comes through its door.  Tea room is a pretentious name.  Perhaps at one time it was fashionable.  perhaps at one time it  was a cheerful place to come and drink tea with some extra treat to sweeten the experience.  There is a hint of this long ago time with the fancy crown molding and the wall paper which might at one time had delicate flowers on trailing vines.  But now everything is dingy and uncared for, the dishes, which are chipped, the tables which are unsteady, the floor which does not look like it has ever been swept and especially the people.   Nobody cares for them and they do not care for themselves.

But I come here a lot because the tea is hot and cheap and because it is near my lodgings.  No one minds how long you stay if you ask for a new pot of tea every so often.

fortunately, Christabel, Captain Star Runner's artificial intelligence, had made it possible for me to read and speak the local language so I could comprehend the sheets in front of me.

I looked at the table and I looked at the sheets of some filmy material.  I wondered about laying them down on the sticky table.  Gwennore roused herself enough to bring a damp cloth and made headway on the grime.  I spread the sheets out to read.

I glanced through the information on The Rebel Horde.  There had been other instances of their signs being planted where they would be seen by royal investigator's, but no one seemed to know anything else about them.  No one knew whether to take them seriously or not.

I could not put it off any longer.  I had to read about what would happen to me if I could not satisfactorily solve this matter of The Rebel Horde.  I found the appropriate film sheet and froze.  I thought I would be sick.  The penalty for killing a royal swan was not only death but death by being pulled apart.  I would be tied to each of four horses, one for every limb.  These horses would be sent galloping in four different directions.  Obviously, my body could not withstand all that pulling.  I stared at the film sheet for some time.  The swans were beautiful, but they were only birds after all.  Somehow I did not see how Hollin would consent to pardoning me.  She wanted a horrible death for what she considered the horrible death of her swan.  I suddenly wondered if she ever went to the lake to look at the swans.  Somehow I did not think so.  The swans were just one of her possessions and she considered an attack against one of her possessions, unique to her position as queen, to be an attack on herself.  The Rebel Horde was just a ruse.


With shaking hands I put down that film sheet and picked up another.  I tried to focus.  The letters swam before me as if they were just random marks on the sheet.  Then one particular word stood out to me.  Silently, I sounded it out.  I had never seen this word written before in the local language.
-----
This language  and script needs a name.  So many names to come up with.  I don't know any other works of Debussy.  A trip to wikipedia is in order.
-----
The word sounded like--  My attention focused.  I read the entire sentence, then scanned the paragraph.  Yes, I was right.  The particular word was Gyllian and there was her entire name and rank, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo.

I read the report from the beginning.  This is the gist of it.  When the swan was found, Gyllian supplied the case with my name on it so it could be planted by the swan's dead body.

The film sheet dropped from my hand.  I was shaking.

"You'll be pulled apart with everyone looking on, you will," Gwennore announced, misinterpreting my shaking for fear.

But I was shaking with anger.  i swept all the film sheets  together and pushed my chair back.

"I need to speak with Hollis," I said.

"You cannot do that," Teddy said, rousing himself from his torpor.  "It's not allowed in a manner like this.  Besides, it's near quitting time."

"First of all," I said while I pulled on my coat and twined my scarf several times around my neck, "there it's no such thing as quitting time when you are involved in an active investigation.  Second of all, based on what I read in these reports, there is no reason to think I had anything to do with the death of a royal swan."

"But the case,," Teddy protested.  It was the first time I had ever seen him animated.

"Was a plant," I said.  "It was intended to implicate me."

He collapsed back in his chair.

"You knew that, did not you?" I leaned into him, stabbing a finger toward his chest.  "You knew.  You knew it was a plant.  I bet you were the one who put the case there."

Teddy squirmed in his chair.  He said nothing.

"Well, now I know," I said, "and now I am going to talk to Hollis."

I gathered my things and walked out of the Green Street Tea Room.  Gwennore and Teddy scrambled too put on their coats and come after me.  I was already walking fast down the street toward the main thoroughfare.  A horse drawn cab was waiting ahead of me.  Why not?  I clambered inside.  "We're going to the Royal Precinct," I said.  "If they're are close behind, the other two can come, too."

We waited.  It seemed a long wait but I was impatient to get in to see Hollis.

Teddy shot me resentful looks.  I suspected paying for a cab was not usual for a person of my station, but that was his problem, not mine.  

**  Scene 12:  My Interview with Prince Hollis

I faced Hollis across the conference room table.

"I am being framed for this crime," I said to him.  "Based on these reports, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo provided the case with my name on it.  I want all charges dropped and I want to know what Colonel Romeres Lujo's interest is in framing me."'

I had many more questions, but first things first.

Hollis looked like he was going to cry.  Lord Stern was not present.  Maybe he worked only during business hours.  Looking at the uncomfortable man across from me I realized Hollis was only a kid, in his late teens at best.  I was willing to guess his sister, the queen, was not much older.  They had no real sense of death or, and maybe more important, of suffering and of the consequences of their actions.  He started pulling at his hair.  "I cannot drop the charges," he said.  "The swan is dead."

"But you know I did not kill it," I said.

"Yes, yes, of course I do," Hollis whined.  "But she said--"

"Who said," I demanded.

"Gyllian," he said, "Gyllian said you would find out who The Rebel Horde is.  We don't know how to find out."

"Did it ever cross anyone's mind to simply ask me to find out?" I asked.

"I meant no harm," Hollis said.  His tone sounded like the bleating of a goat.  I remembered that sound from a video story I liked to watch as a child.

"Meanwhile you have terrified me and I think it is doubtful your sister will be satisfied with anything but my death, a violent death from what I have read."

Hollis began to tremble.

"She can make it a quick and painless death," he said.

"Are you serious?"  I could hardly believe Hollis thought this would be helpful to say.  "Make sense, man.  Whether death is quick and painless or slow and horrible, I will end up dead just the same."

"I'm sorry," he said and he began to cry.

I slapped the table hard.  "Stop that," I said in a loud voice.  "Crying will not help.  Tell me everything."

The voice of command worked.  Hollis took out a handkerchief, blew his nose and began telling me what happened.

Gyllian had contacted Hollin and Hollis a few weeks after my arrival in Capital City.  Her overtures to the Confederation of the Three Planets had failed.  They did not want to have any ties with other human beings.  Gyllian wanted to establish some form of communication.  Lord Stern thought this was a good idea.  He convinced the queen and the prince to accept her invitation.  They signed a mutual cooperation treaty secretly as to not "mess up" (in Hollis's words), their membership in the Confederation.  Such side deals were strictly prohibited.

While Gyllian was still in the Royal Precincts, the first information came to them about The Rebel Horde.  Gyllian suggested they contact me but Lord Stern was reluctant to authorize an investigation outside of their information gathering apparatus.  Gyllian left Marathon.  Prince Hollis did not know where she went and what she did, but recently she returned.  When the last notice next to the dead swan appeared, Gyllian suggested they involve me.

"Did she know about the death penalty for killing  a swan?" I asked.

"No one said anything about that," Hollis admitted.  "It was Hollin who went off about the swan."

"Is Gyllian still here?" I asked.  I had to speak with her immediately.

"I think so," Hollis said.  She sounded very uncertain.

"Then contact her," I said, using my command voice.  "I need to speak to her right away."

Prince Hollis shifted in his seat.  "I don't know how," he said.

"Who does"

"Lord Stern."

"Then get him," I said.

"It's after hours."  That bleat again.

"I do not care if it is after hours," I said.  "Call that ship and let me talk to her."

"Is it necessary?" Hollis asked.  He seemed terrified at the prospect of disturbing Lord Stern.  "Lord Stern doesn't like it when we call him."

"It's an emergency," I said.

"Do you really think so?" Hollis asked.  He was incredulous.

"My life is an emergency," I said.

"But sentence will not be carried out for two weeks," Hollis said.

"The sooner we get this sorted out, the sooner you will know who The Rebel Horde is."  My promise was rash but it seemed the right thing to say because Hollis got up from the table and walked awkwardly toward the office door.  He was so afraid and uncertain.

I stayed at his heels, making sure I entered the office with him.

He fumbled with his equipment and, stammering, made his request to Lord Stern.

I grabbed the speaking tube from his hand.

"Lord Stern," I said, "This is Ronnie Camberwell.  I need to speak with Colonel Romeres Lujo urgently.  Can you tell me how to work this equipment to contact her."

Lord Stern was taken aback, but he was, thankfully, a reasonable man.

"It will be quicker to come and do it for you," he said.

True to his word, he arrived within fifteen minutes.  He made the call.



The voice that responded to Lord Sterns call was very familiar.  Before he could speak, I spoke.

"Christabel," I said, not bothering to identify myself because, after all, Captain Star Runner's artificial intelligence who ran her spaceship would be able to instantly identify me, "is Gyllian on board?"

"Yes," Christabel replied.

"I need to speak with her face to face immediately," I said.

"That will not be possible," Christabel said.

"Why not?" I snapped.

"We are not near Marathon," Christabel said.  "We were not planning to return to the star system for some time."

"I need you back here now.  Hollin plans to have me horribly executed in less than two weeks."

"Oh dear," Christabel said.  She sounded upset.  "That was unforeseen.  We will be there as soon as possible."

Christabel made that happen and within three days I was aboard Captain Star Runner's spaceship.

*  Chapter Four:  Confrontation
**  Scene 13:  In Space Again

"What were you think?" I asked Gyllian yet again, pointing my finger at her.

"You are getting excited," Captain Star Runner interjected.

I turned to the fuchsia-colored Pantheran.  

"Yes, I'm getting excited," I said.  "I was cold, hungry, about to be homeless and you were here all the time not giving a credit for my well-being.  You told me you were off to that other arm of the galaxy."

"I was," Star insisted, "but Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said--"

"You whore." I screamed at Star.  My outburst startled all three of us.  

"She contacts you and you run."

The double entendre was not lost on anyone.  Being a star runner means to run the spaceship.

"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said it was important," Star said, very confused by my outburst.

"It is," Gyllian said.  

She was, as always, calm and in control.  My welfare seemed unimportant to her.

"All you had to do was ask," I repeated.  I sounded winy even to my own ears.

"We did not part on the best of terms," Gyllian reminded me.

"It was because of you I find myself doubly in this position," I retorted.  I was getting angry all over again.

"I was minding my own business, doing my job, when you set off the Pantherans."

"That's what we working on right now," Gyllian reminded me, "we're trying to control this space."

Gyllian had previously explained to me that she and Star were reviewing the insertion and extraction points which led to the Confederation of Three Planets.  There had been some chatter that the Ministry of Defense for the Alliance of Planets on the Northern Frontier had overheard.  In her opinion, Gyllian thought it possible that the Pantherans could enter this part of space and find the human beings here, human beings that did not want to be found.

"You owe it to the rest of humanity," Gyllian said.

"I don't owe the rest of humanity anything," I said.  "the rest of humanity hasn't done much for me lately except put me under a death penalty.  I might be better off in Ptolemy City where, despite not having much of a rule of law, I've always been treated better than you have ever treated me."

Gyllian said, "A typical League of Hypatian Pirate response."

"They have a point," I said.


"The Pharaoh Star System can be useful," Gyllian said, "but it is lawless and unprincipled."

"And you thinking involving me in a death penalty situation is either lawful or principled?"

"Sacrifices have to be made," Gyllian said.

"That's easy for you to say when it's not you that is being sacrificed."

I stared at Star who had said nothing.  The rational part of my mind knew much of this was incomprehensible to the Pantheran mind and to Star's ungendered mind in particular.  Star was a genetically modified being, created simply to serve Pantheran interests.  Star's self hood was of no importance to The Race at all.  Star accepted this.  When Star was designated for termination, however, Star had fled Coalition Space and set herself up as a trader on the Northern Frontier.

"I wouldn't have let anything happen to you," Star said.

"Not true," I said, pouncing on her timidity.  "Christabel said you were not due back in system for weeks."

"We did not know about the charges," Star said.

"And if I had not pushed to contact you, you would have found out too late," I said.

Star folded up into quivering mass of Pantheran.  She twitched all over.

I turned to Gyllian once again.

"And what would you have said then?" I asked her.

She shrugged as elegantly as Teddy shrugged.

"The death penalty was unforeseen," she said.

Suddenly, Star's unwillingness to defend my position and Gillian's indifference was too much.  I turned away and walked out of the lounge.  I returned to the stateroom which had been mine.  Some of my things were still there.  I suppose the beaded case with my name on it had come aboard after all.

I sat on the edge of the narrow bed and put my face into my hands.  I would not cry but I did not know what to think or what to say.  No one had come to my defense.  What did this mean for my relationship with Star.  What was Star's relationship with Gyllian?  Gyllian had always known how to manipulate Star and Star accepted her word without question.

I knew why, of course.  Gyllian had saved Star's life when Star had been reckless.  I supposed that was as good a reason as any to do what someone else asked.

I knew Christabel was watching.  Christabel often kept her own counsel.  She did not always share what she saw and heard with Star.  Star's thoughts and feelings were an open book to her.

Christabel spoke.  "Ronnie, the Pantheran threat is real.  It's not just the chatter Alliance Intelligence picked up.  The Fungusian Network has heard chatter, too."

"How do you know?" I asked, despite my vow to myself not to care.  I am, after all, a detective.

"Josh has been talking to them," Christabel said.

"So Josh is in on this, too," I said.  I felt totally demoralized.

"Yes," Christabel said.  "And you might as well know that The Czarina and Captain Kidd are doing some reconnaissance as well."

"So I'm the only one excluded," I said.  "Is Emily Dickinson involved, too."

"He's monitoring things on the Northern Frontier," Christabel said.

Well, that was the whole group.

"The problems with the Landscape of Thorns is responsible for your exclusion," Christabel said.

"I proved useful for The Big Dig," I said.

Christabel did not respond.  I wondered if Tamara might have had some influence there.  I had gotten along well with her.

"Star wants to talk with you," Christabel said.

I did not want to talk with Star, but I was aboard Star's vessel and I could not continue to not talk with Star.

"Okay," I said.

**  Scene 14: A Conversation with Captain Star Runner
-----
I have forgotten so much.  I don't remember if this ride has a name.  I cannot remember the name of the race which readjusted Star's metabolic rate and what else that meant.  I cannot remember exactly how Star's platform looked except that it is turquoise in color, I think.  I will have to come back and fill this in along with the right names of all these alliances and confederations.  I think the people in the other arm of the galaxy are called the People of the Rainbow, but then again, that could be the bad guys.  Maybe I'll just stick with this and correct later.  Sanctuary was written two years ago and I just don't remember.
-----
Although Star freely moves about the ship, Star prefers the area we human beings call the bridge.  I think Star refers to it as the control center.  

Star was stretched out on a pedestal with a platform large enough to hold Star's body comfortably.  The People of the Rainbow Way who inhabit another arm of our galaxy provided Star with this ship and this platform after readjusting Star's metabolism to conform with their security systems.  Genetic drift caused Star to become ill at their facilities.    Ten thousand years ago or more Star's ancestors ran ships from the western spiral arm to their space and back again.  Star says the adjustment has made her responses quicker and her thinking clearer.  It has also enhanced her already significant ability to locate insertion points into and extraction points out of hyperspace on the fly.  All runners have this ability, but Star is the best, or so she says.  Star is quite confident of her abilities.  I am told all Pantherans are.

Star sat up when I came into the room.

"You wanted to see me," I said, trying to keep my voice non-committal.  Star was, after all, the captain of this ship and could see and talk with anyone she liked and the people aboard were duty bound to talk with the captain.  This was always understood and there were regulations on the books.  Whether those regulations applied here I did not know.  Presumably maritime law would apply if no space regulations existed.

"Yes," Star said.  Star's voice sounded just as non-committal as mine. 

The tension in the  room between us was palpable.

-----
How many cliches can I write in as few sentences as possible?  On with the plot if not the quality of the writing.
-----
"I know you are mad at me," Star finally said after a prolonged silence.

"I'm mad at everyone involved," I said.

"I thought you wanted to be independent on Marathon," Star said.

"Don't put this one on me," I snapped.  "There's no reason why you could not have told me you were back in system.  You had no idea what was happening to me."

Star was silent.  I wondered what the back channel conversation between her and Christabel was.  Star's brain and the artificial intelligence Christabel share mind space.  Star cannot regulate her own body.  The AI must do it so Star is permanently linked to her AI.  Christabel can archive and retrieve memories, present calculations and is an interface between Star and the ship.  They are separate at some level, but they are also intertwined.  Star has free will and emotions.  Christabel can control thoughts and emotions through data storage and the application of biochemicals.  It gives Star access to nearly inexhaustible memory but it also means that Star is totally dependent on her AI for even life itself.

"Christabel says I should apologize," Star finally said.

"Do you think otherwise?" I asked.

Here it was again, the old uncomfortable situation of first our marriage and after its disillusion, our renewed relationship.  Christabel was present.  I could never have Star totally to myself.  Star would not, could not, exist without an AI.  As the most up-to-date model, Christabel seemed like another person in our lives.  Star was able to record everything and play it back.  I could learn everything Star and Gyllian had both talked about and done.  Star had no secrets from Christabel and, if either Christabel or Star decided I should know about all these conversations and actions, I could know everything, too.

"I want to do the right thing," Star said.  "I do not like it when you are mad at me.  I feel bad and I do not like feeling that way.  Christabel says she will not remove that feeling until you are not mad at me."

Christabel was taking her stand.  The AI had definite opinions.  She did not always side with me.  She always maintains Star's well-being is her first priority.  She thinks making up with me is Star's best path through this emotional minefield.

I took a deep breath.  I did not like being mad at Star either.  I loved Star and I was passionately attracted to her.  Looking critically at her, I saw the signs of stress and demoralization.

I stepped toward the platform and held out my arms.  Star went into them.

"You silly kitten," I said.  "Of course I still love you.  I'm mad as hell but I haven't stopped loving you."

Star began to purr.

Star is a large, a very large, cat.  The Pantherans do not like to be called cats, but looking at them, every human being can recognize a cat.  Besides, they purr wonderfully.  Star's whole body vibrates with the sound of it.

Star tickled my face with her whiskers.

"Stop that," I cried and batted at them, not too hard.  I had to learn that they were very sensitive as well as being luxuriant.

Star is a striking Pantheran.  For one thing, Star is fuchsia-colored, an extremely rare color.  Most Pantherans we see are pastel-colored, but Star's color is rich with both highlights of pink and lowlights of dark purple.  The first time I saw Star she was prancing across the lobby of Shepheard's Hotel, the finest and oldest hotel in Ptolemy City.  She was wearing a filmy scarf which fluttered as she moved.  I literally stopped and stared.  The gossamer fabric set off her rippling muscles.  She was magnificent and I wanted her though I had no idea what they would mean for my life or for my own sexual appetites.  Human women were never the same after I made love with Star though Tara Lee had come close.

 I squeezed Star's shoulders, then stepped back.

"What's going on here?" I asked.

"About what?"  Star often misses the nuances of human speech and thinking.

"With your project, with what The Czarina and Captain Kidd are doing, with what is going on in Capital City."

"You'll have to ask Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo about all that," Star said.  "I am working on the access to and from Mother Space."

I rubbed Star behind the ears.

"OK," I said.  "Just don't leave me."

"I will not," Star promised.  "I will not abandon you on Marathon."

"That's good," I said.  "I would never forgive you."

"Never?" Star asked.

"Never," I said.  "I will be dead if something doesn't get straightened out."

I knew, without discussing it with her, that Gyllian needed me on Marathon and despite my protestations, I also knew that stopping the Pantherans from finding the Confederation of Three Planets or at least coming into their space was absolutely critical.  If the Fungusian Network had heard the chatter and passed it on through Josh, it was real enough.  Star always thought of the Pantheran presence as the Pantheran Empire.  She had always been schooled that the Coalition was a ruse to fool the other races.  This could have been propaganda, of course.  There is no doubt that gendered Pantherans exploit the ungendered ones, but something had always convinced me that empire is the truth of the matter.  The Pantherans are in control.  They choose to let the Pharaoh Star System go its way.  If it were truly a problem, they would have shut it down.

Well, it was time to talk with Gyllian.
**  Scene15:  A Conversation with Gyllian


I had seen Gyllian working in the lounge when I passed through to the Control Center.  She was still there when I re-entered the lounge and sat opposite her at the round table used for eating and working.  She did not look up.

I decided to watch and wait.  This was a power play, of course, but it also looked like Gyllian was doing something important.  Finally, she stopped and looked across the table at me.  She did not speak.

"Why don't you start by filling me in," I said.

"I see you have come to your senses," Gyllian replied.

My anger flared.  OK, bitch, let's see who can be the adult here.

"There's a job to be done," I said.  "I cannot help you if I don't know what's going on.  Dying horribly will not help your mission and losing me this way will not help your reputation even if I don't appear in your reports.  I'm sure word will get out that I was pulled apart by horses on your watch."

Gyllian dropped the mug she was holding.  More properly, she stopped holding the mug.  Liquid splashed in her lap.  The mug hit the floor and rolled away.  Gyllian did not move.

"They do what?" she asked, staring at me incredulously.

"They tie each of your limbs to a horse and then have the horses gallop, one in each direction, north south, east and west, and you are pulled apart," I said, describing what I had read in the filmy sheets.  "It is a great spectacle.  The more screaming there is, the better, and of course the blood.  A certain amount of wagering goes on and there are all sorts of vendors selling food, drink and mementos."

"How barbaric," Gyllian exclaimed.

"Yes, I agree," I said.  "Prince Hollis thought he might get my sentence changed to a less painful death if I proved I had not killed the swan. I am not certain Hollin would agree."

Gyllian did not respond to having spilled anything in her lap.  I hoped she wasn't burned.

"Are you OK?" I asked.  "The coffee wasn't too hot, I hope."

Gyllian looked around for her mug.

"It's on the floor," I said.  "You dropped it."

Bewildered, Gyllian looked at her lap.

"Oh, I see," she said, but she did not move.

"Who are Hollin and Hollis?"

"Hollis is the prince," I said.  "Hollin is the queen.  They're both kids.  Hollin might be twenty.  Hollis is still a kid, maybe fifteen or sixteen."

"I thought the queen was Victoria and she is very old," Gyllian said, regaining some of her control.

"Victoria is the old queen from old Earth," I said.  "They play parts for public consumption, but the real queen and prince are these kids."

"I've only dealt with Lord Stern," Gyllian admitted.

"He seems to be the grown-up," I said.

"You had better tell me everything after I change," Gyllian decided.

So she did and I did.

** Scene 16:  More  Conversation with Gyllian

When Gyllian sat down at the table again with a fresh mug of steaming coffee she said, "I can understand now why you were so emotional when you came aboard.  I want you to know that I never," and here she paused for effect, "never intended for you to come to any harm.  I hope we can put this misunderstanding aside to move forward."

That was it.  That was the apology she was willing to offer.  On the face of it, she admitted no wrongdoing.  There was "No, I'm sorry<".  Her physical response earlier was as close as I would ever come to her taking any responsibility for my plight.

I waited a little while before answering.

"Let's talk about what happens next.  I could hide out here where Hollin cannot reach me, but I don't think that's a viable long-term solution."

Gyllian could have made a remark about how much I disliked living aboard a spaceship and how poor a space traveler I am, but she diplomatic ally refrained from bringing that subject up.

"I need you on Marathon, running this Rebel Horde group to ground," Gyllian said.  "From what The Czarina and Captain Kidd tell me, it has popped up all over Llondune.  Fortunately,m as uncouth and backward  as that planet is, it has the sense to discuss its problems with its neighbors.  That isn't happening on Marathon as far as I can tell.  Each province is very insular.  There's a lot of unexplored and unpopulated area on the planet.  This ship doesn't have the sensors to do a planetary survey.  That might indicate to us that there is a large settlement of people the provinces don't know about, but if this is a fairly small group, we wouldn't find them with the best ship available.  The Ministry of Defense says I need to work with the resources I have."

"So they don't have a great investment in this project," I said.  It was more a statement than a question.

"It's important." Gyllian said.  "Resources are spread very thin.  It's a very long border between the Northern Frontier and the Coalition.  Besides, we have to keep an eye on the Republic of Space, Queens land and the Sacred Worlds.  We also have to be aware of what is happening in places like Dirty World and Pirate's Cove."

Star had regularly worked many of these other worlds and called the two space stations home for some time.

"If The Rebel Horde is on more than one planet, it's a fairly large organization that has the resources to travel," I said, thinking aloud.

Gyllian waited to see what else I might say.  My perspective was fresh and my ability to figure things out was quite good.

"I'm guessing they plant their messages where important people can see them.  Why else put a message near a swan in Debussy-on-La-Mer.  They are willing to take great risks.  They killed a swan which merits the death penalty.  Their aim is to change society."

"Or to disrupt it," Gyllian said.

"Why do you say that?"

"Suppose, just suppose, they are agents of a foreign power.  They have no interest in changing any government.  They are simply paid in one form or another to pretend to b a rebel organization intent on changing the status quo."

"Are you suggesting these are Pantherans trying to disrupt the Confederation?"  I was trying to picture this.

"What if they are human agents of the Pantheran Empire," Gyllian said.  "Richard (I cannot remember his last name but he called himself King Richard, Duke of the Gloucester Road) was such an agent."

"That proved to be fatal for him," I said.

"And it was nearly fatal for us all," Gyllian said.

But I had become involved with Star during that time. (in Library of the Mind).


"What would be the Pantherans goal here?" I asked.

"Instability," Gyllian responded promptly.  "If there is suspicion and possibly civil war or unrest or hostilities break out between the provinces, no one will be paying attention to what an invasion force is doing.  It wouldn't take many ships to overpower these people.  They depend on the locks for their extraction point, but Star has discovered many extraction points.  I think it is a safe bet Star isn't the only star runner that can find them.  After all, they only have to find one to get in and one to get back out again.  And who is going to defend these people?  The Alliance doesn't have the resources.  The Solar League is inside Coalition Space.  There is no organized government in the Southern Frontier that can even mount enough military vessels to make coming here worthwhile.  No one has the financial resources to raise a force from the League of Hypatian Pirates or any other world."

"And you think the Pantherans would do something like this?" I asked.

"The disappearance of those populations back in the Second Expansion irritates them.  They have long memories due to the fact they keep all the records of all the memory files from that time as well as the reports and memoirs of the gendered leaders.  The Pantheran contracts with the Fungusian Network are enormous and the amount of archives they have is staggering.  It defies human comprehension.  Add to that circumstance Star's ability to get through an insertion point in the Pharaoh Star System and lock them out and you have a recipe for an empire-sized grudge."

"Or," I said, "it is strictly a local uprising that appeals to a lot of people.  Having lived in one of the poorer neighborhoods in Capital City, I can tell you that a lot of people have nothing to lose and perhaps a lot to gain.  There isn't a lot of upward mobility as far as I could see.  There are the haves and the have nots and there isn't much in between."

"It would really be helpful if we knew if The Rebel Horde was working in the other provinces," Gyllian said.

"Maybe we can find out," I said.  "I wonder if Hollis could be persuaded to find out."

"What sort of a person is Hollis?" Gyllian inquired.

"Hollis is very young," I said, thinking about what I knew and what I suspected about the prince.  "He is good-looking.  He is naive and he does not have control over his emotions.  I think he is fascinated by space but he does not have a grasp of the practical.  He could not operate the telecommunications device you left Lord Stern.  He could barely place a call unassisted.  He respects authority.  I could insist he do as I ask and he capitulated without much of a fight."

"So he's young, eager and malleable," Gyllian mused.  "What about his sister."

"She strikes me as impressed with her own position and indifferent to the need of others.  Her self-preoccupation seems more childish than anything else.  I would call her a spoiled child.  That's how she acts."

"So she is just as immature as the prince but in a different way," Gyllian concluded.

"I think that would be a reasonable assessment," I said.

"So Lord Stern may be the one running the show and making sure these two don't run amuck."

"Probably," I said.  "The Shadowers work directly for him.  He may also control the Information Keepers."

"But the Information Keepers give you what you ask for."  Gyllian was formulating a plan.

"You have to ask the right questions," I said.  "It's not like a database you can poke around in.  You have to ask specific questions to get information."

"Explain."

"I cannot say give me everything you have on spaceships," I said.  "I would have to say something like Can spaceships travel to the center of the galaxy.  I can do follow up questions in the same request.  How fast can a spaceship go.  How long would it take?  What would people eat on the trip, that sort of thing.  I could ask for schematics or how to build the spaceship's engines."

"I see," Gyllian said.  "But you couldn't say give me everything you have on spaceships and then poke around to discover some useful facts."

"Besides, everything is printed out on filmy sheets," I said.

"Of course," Gyllian said.  "They don't have data retrieval systems."

"They do, I'm sure," I said, "but I don't have access to them.  I can only ask questions to be put into the data retrieval system so that the answers can be printed out."

"How archaic," Gyllian said.

I shrugged one of Teddy's shrugs.

"You know," I said, "a shadower would be a perfect person to plant those messages."

"So would your crazy lady," Gyllian said.

I smiled at her.  "Maybe Teddy and Gwennore are working together."

"Could be.  If they are Pantheran agents, what better person to watch than you."

It wasn't funny any more.  Gyllian could well be right.

** Scene 17: A New Strategy Emerges

"You know," I said, thinking as I spoke, "do you have a map of Marathon?"

"No, why?"  Gyllian set her coffee cup down.  It was empty.  I had her full attention now.  "What are you thinking?"

"People in Capital City are suspicious of strangers.  Take my landlady, for example.  She always says I should not have come to Capital City.  Foreigners don't belong there.  She is convinced I'm from somewhere called the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  I'm just wondering where that might be.  Apparently the Democracy of Rock and Roll has very different values than that of the Royal Province of Debussy-On-La_mer."

"And why is that important?" Gyllian was becoming impatient.

"What if The Rebel Horde comes from there," I said.  "If their values are opposite those of the Royal Province of Debussy-On-La-Mer, that would be a logical place to begin looking for these people whether they are Pantheran agents or not.  In order to find them, it probably doesn't matter immediately whether they are working for the Empire or not."

"You have a point.  If it is an internal matter, it probably doesn't matter much to us, but they are rife for Pantheran infiltration.  The Pantherans are perfectly capable of blasting in the system with guns blazing, so to speak, and wiping out all life, but they might be very interested in control rather than annihilation if cooler heads prevail."

"And would cooler heads prevail?" I asked.

"Most likely.  That is the genius of the ungendered work force.  They are designed, to use that awful word, to perform their tasks efficiently and without question.  To have that be a hallmark of their activities, the actions must be reasonable because the ungendered work pretty much independently of the gendered Pantherans and they work with other ungendered members of The Race."

Except for officers on the military vehicles, I thought.  Star's encounter with them was degrading.  It included rape and humiliation.  That was a side issue and not germane to our general discussion.  I knew what Gyllian meant.  The gendered Pantherans stayed home mostly and the ungendered ones did all the work both domestically and beyond their home world.

"OK," I said.  "I can ask for a map of Marathon from the Information Keepers which will be generally useful and information about the Democracy of Rock and Roll, specifically, where it is and how to get there.  If it is not too difficult, I'll go there as part of my investigation."

"Will you be questioned why you want to leave the province?" Gyllian asked.

"I have no idea," I said, "but I think suggesting The Rebel Horde comes from there will be accepted.  If The Rebel Horde is real, it is in definite opposition to a Royal Province.  I will also ask if there has been any contact from The Rebel Horde in any other province.  They may not know, but perhaps that information has been shared because it is disruptive."

"OK," Gyllian said.  "We can give you a direct link to the ship so you can stay in touch.  Keep us apprized of your movements.  Barring anything unforeseen, that should be sufficient.  Stay out of the Royal Province of Debussy-On-La-Mer if something goes wrong and we're not here to pull you out.  And finally, we'll chip you so Christabel can find you if you cannot communicate with us directly."

*  Chapter Five:  Questions About the Democracy of Rock and Roll
**  Scene 18:  Reviewing More Data
I was again sitting in the dingy Green Street Tea Room.  Mrs. Farnesworth had made some cutting remarks about my absence to the effect that alley cats stayed out all night, but I ignored her.  Decent food, a comfortable bed, long hot showers and intimate time with Captain Star Runner had done wonders for my morale and disposition.  Neither Teddy nor Gwennore questioned my absence.  I do not know what anyone at the Royal Precincts told them.  Perhaps time off with pay was sufficient.  By the time I received answers to my questions, I had only nine days left to solve the mystery of who killed the swan.  Star and Gyllian planned to use the time to check out insertion and extraction points very close to the star system we were in.  Human spaceship operators would never have a jump gate so close to the star, but Star was of the opinion that competent star runners could manage a transition that close in.  She might not like doing it, but she had no doubt she would manage it with no ill side effects.  "Especially," she commented, "if I had no Terry passengers aboard.  Military members of The Race were designed to withstand higher  of G forces than Terries."  That Pantheran arrogance was never far from the surface.  I always wanted to ask what members of The Race thought they were not as good as human beings at, but I suspected Star would say she did not understand the question.  I would have to ask Christabel about that some day.  Right now I needed to focus on these filmy sheets.

If I could have reviewed the sheets in private, Gyllian could have provided me with a scanner and a database, but we were uncomfortable with the idea that my position might be compromised.  We explained my absence as interrogation by Hollis and others.  Teddy and Gwennore accepted this lie.

The first shocking thing I discovered was that information varied on the whereabouts of the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  There was no such thing as a definitive map of Marathon.  When I asked why, Emma explained that there was no way to make such a map.  Different groups which had originally come to Marathon during the Second Expansion Wars had just picked territory and settled there.  Over time, one group made contact with another and so forth until they thought everyone who was on the planet had made their presence known.  This was not true of the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  There were always rumors, but nothing definitive.

"So," I said, "the Democracy of Rock and Roll might exist and it might not."

"That is true," Emma admitted.  "Mostly we use it to scare children."

So, I thought, it was a land of the boogeyman.  Oh well, it might exist.  I would have to read through the references and see if there was anything to go on.  I had had a nice theory, but it looked like it was evaporating.

As for references to The Rebel Horde, Emma came up with nothing at all.  I put in a request for either Lord Stern or Prince Hollis to check to see if any information on this line of investigation existed, but I was not hopeful they would get back to me on this.  It was a shot in the dark.  I thought that perhaps there was a classified area even the Information Keepers could not access.  Emma denied there was such a classification, but I was not sure if I believed her.

I spread the version of the map of the planet Emma considered the most reliable out on the table I had already wiped down.  Gwennore and Teddy grudgingly moved their plates and cups.

"We are here," I said, pointing to The Afternoon of the Faun River.  Here is the ocean simply labeled La Mer.  A mountain range lay to the west of The Faun while rolling hills lay to the east.  If I followed the river northwards, I came to the Royal Province of Bach, Brahms and Beethoven.  I saw names like Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Schubert.  Mozart was way to the east while Verdi and Telemann were close to the pole.  
Barbara of Portugal was in the center of the continent.  There were many blank spaces.  Some of these were marked "mountainous" or "dessert", but some were simply blank.

I turned to a map especially made for me according to Emma.  It listed the possible sites for the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  Most of these placed it on the other continent of Marathon.  One suggested an archipelago to the west while a third sketched it in one of the larger deserts of this continent.

I was surprised when Teddy spoke.  "My old man said the Democracy of Rock and Roll was here."  He pointed.

Before I could say anything, Gwennore said, "There be dragons."

"Dragons?" I asked.  "You mean fire-breathing dragons?"

I thought of the children's books I had watched with princesses and caves and terrifying creatures with great wings.

"Thinking about going there, are you?  You'll be eaten alive if you do." she said.

"You're a crazy one," Teddy shot back.  "My dad said nothing about dragons.  He got it from this prospector."

"Prospector?" I said.

"Yeah.  This friend of my old man worked there when he was young looking for treasure."

"Did he find any?" I asked.

"I don't know.  He was dead when the old man told me about him.  My dad did not say if he was rich or not, just that he went there and came back.  Just going there was a big deal."

I looked at the place Teddy had indicated.  It had no label on it.  It was south of The Royal Province of Debussy-On-La-Mer along the coast.

"Does this area have a name?" I asked.  "there is nothing on this map."

"Dragon country," Gwennore said.

"No," Teddy scoffed.  "These mountains here," he indicated them with his finger, "they're called the Stairway to Heaven Hills, but there aren't hills.  They're big with snow on the top."

"And this river," again he pointed, "this is the Rock and Roll Ruby River."

I looked again where he was pointing.  The river started and stopped and seemed very twisted with many loops.  It looked like it crossed and re crossed the Stairway to Heaven Hills.

"And is this whole area the Democracy of Rock and Roll?" I asked.

It sounded more like a legend of pirates or the place where the League of Hypatian Pirates would set up if they came ashore on Marathon.

Teddy shrugged.  "Could be," he said.  "I don't know about any cities."

I started paging through my maps, looking to see if there were other maps with different ideas of what lay to our south.  As I laid each map down on top of the one before it, I saw the same mountain range but in different places.  I saw a river but it went different places.  The only thing I could be confident about at all was that to the south of The Royal Province of Debussy-On-La_mer was a mountain range and a river.

I decided I had to take the time to revisit Emma.

She frowned when I asked for more information about this region.

"Your query is too general," she said.  "It will be rejected."

"OK," I said.  "Help me craft a better query."

She stared at me.

"that is the information I require," I said.  "I need a better query to get more information about this area.  I need to know if there are maps, information on who lives there, memoirs or journals of people who traveled there, that sort of thing."

Emma smiled.  "These are all good questions," she said and soon I held a small number of filmy sheets in my hand.

I still had no information that definitely said  this was the Democracy of Rock and Roll nor did I have any more information about The Rebel Horde, whether they came from this area or not.  What I did have were two journals and within both of them, crudely drawn maps.  I sat down in the Green Street Tea Room to skim them.

** Scene 19: Tales of a Fabulous City in the Stairway to Heaven Hills  
-----
Separator lines is the only way I can think of to separate, get it, my thought process from the novel itself.  I have unearthed two problems so far:

1.  The time line.  With only nine days left and nineteenth century Old Earth technology, it will be impossible for Ronnie to mount an exploration in the area south of The Royal Province of Debussy-On-La-Mer, have the adventure and then return.
2.  From a narrative perspective, all the characters do is trek back and forth from the Green Street Tea Room, dare I say the dingy Green Street Tea Room, to the Information Keepers booth.  Ronnie asks questions, receives filmy sheets and back she goes to read them.  The reader hears summaries.  Although this is reasonable when considering the process, it must be quite boring to read.  Even the bits of information Teddy has are from dead people who cannot be interviewed.  Should they be alive?

The work around is to extend the time a little, shorten the time it take for the spaceship to get back and forth from their insertion and extraction point investigation or, what I'm going to do, have the gear readily available from Lord Stern.  It's a novel.  Anything is possible.
-----

Rumors.  Hearsay.  Tall tales.  Everything was included in the packet of information Emma gave me.  As I read each page, the stories became more improbable.  There were very few points of agreement either.  Some said this area was the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  Others indignantly insisted it was not.  Some said it was a region that failed to become a province.  Others said it had been a free zone from the first.  I drew several conclusions:

1.  This area of Marathon had no organized government that interacted with the rest of the provinces of Marathon.
2.  Anyone who ventured into this area was definitely on their own.

Rumors persisted about a fabulously wealthy city in the Stairway to Heaven Hills.

To names kept popping up as I read.  One was El Dorado and the other was the White City.  I sighed.  Not another trek to the Information Keepers!  Then I remembered that I had my own personal database.  I had not used in on Marathon because there was no network to tap into, but because Captain Star Runner had paid for me to have the latest wet wiring installed, I did have a database.  Christabel updated it when I was on board Star's ship most recently.  I wondered if it would have these two terms.

Happily it did.

El Dorado was a mythical city on Old Earth.  Spanish explorers believed it was a South American city which contained much gold and jewels.  They had explored the continent and found many other interesting things like the Amazon River.  They had died in large numbers and harassed the native peoples, but they never did find such a city.  In turn, the so-called White City was in Central America somewhere in the jungles.  It, too, was supposed to be fabulously wealthy.  Archaeologists had found white stones, a wall here and a foundation there.  There was no one White City and if it had been wealthy, no evidence of that remained.  The jungle overtook everything.

The database went on to show me many more instances of mythical fabulous cities.  Shangri-la on Old Earth and many more with these three names across human inhabited space.  There were no less than seventeen instances where the last message from a spaceship or an exploration party indicated they were hot on the trail of a supposed wealthy city, region or planet.  The ones sending the messages disappeared without a trace or returned empty-handed.  Further, This myth was not restricted to human beings.  Other races had these stories, too.  The Featherote had several.  Even the Fungusian Network had one which surprised me.  I always think of the Fungusians as ever practical.  The Featherote could be fanciful though they built the finest engines in the western spiral galactic arm.  And, the greatest surprise of all, the Pantherans had them, too, though their mythical cities always contained valiant warriors.  Whether the warriors triumphed or were defeated depended largely on who was telling the story.  Knowing Star as I did, I knew she would delight in these stories of valor and sacrifice for the warrior unit as a whole.
-----
It would be good to review Star's account of Pink    in this matter.
-----
My database did not have enough space for such tales from the People of the Rainbow Way though a note indicated there were entries.

"You okay?" Teddy asked.  "You've been staring into space for a long while."

"Lost in the Stairway to Heaven ills," are you? Gwennore added.


"I'm oh," I said.  "Just thinking."

"About what?" Teddy asked, showing some interest for the first time.

"The stories about treasure or a wealthy city," I said.  "They're not unique to Marathon."

"But they're real," Teddy insisted with the first sign of a definite opinion he had ever offered.  "My old man told me."

I could have argued with him.  Perhaps I should have argued with him, but I knew I would not win any arguments with Teddy.  His father had said something was true and he was confident it was true.  I had serious reservations.  Of course, I was not out to find treasure of any kind.  I was in search of The Rebel Horde and nothing I read so far convinced me they were there until Gwennore said, "Dragons don't like the royals."

"What?"  Both Teddy and I responded to her remark.

Gwennore repeated herself.  "Dragons don't like royals."

"What dragons, crazy lady?" Teddy asked.  His questions always sounded confrontational.

"The dragons that live there."  Gwennore pointed to the Stairway to Heaven Hills.  "I've heard stories about them  Haven't you?"

"I've never heard any true stories about dragons," Teddy said.

"Then you haven't been listening," Gwennore said.  "I've heard lots of stories about dragons."  She pointed to me.  "She wants to find the dragons.  She will not die if she finds the dragons."

"Are you saying the dragons are the same as The Rebel Horde?" I asked.

Gwennore shook her head.  "You need to find the dragons so you will not die," she repeated.

Teddy smirked.

I was definitely in a bad way.  Gwennore thought there were dragons in the Stairway to Heaven Hills and Teddy was certain there was treasure.  Whether The Rebel Horde could be found there I did not know.  I was running out of places to look.

An Area Boy burst into the Green Street Tea Room.

"You Ronnie?" he asked Teddy.

"No way," Teddy said.  He pointed at me.  "She's Ronnie."

"What kind of name is that for a girl?" the Area Boy asked no one in particular.

No one answered.

"Anyway," he said, "Ronnie gets this," and he pushed a flimsy sheet into my hand.  Then I saw the Clad pin on his coat.  Another official document.

My hands shook as I unfolded it.  This paper was not a royal summons.  It was a brief report of another message from The Rebel Horde.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The dragon has roared.
We will be heard.
You cannot quench our fire.
Tremble at those who will come from the South.
You have been warned.
The Rebel Horde
#+END_QUOTE

I put the flimsy sheet down on the table.  In turn, Teddy and Gwennore picked it up and read it.

"You have an in with the Area Boys?" Teddy asked Gwennore.

"There be dragons in the hills," Gwennore said.

This was down right spooky.

I sighed.  One more trip to the Information Keepers about dragons.

** Scene 20:  About Dragons

What I did not know about dragons was how much the people on Marathon liked dragons.  Emma explained that the Information Keepers had lots of information about dragons, too much to give me all at once.  Could I be more specific.

"I want to know about The Rebel Horde and dragons," I said.  "I want to know about dragons and the region south of here.  I want to know about dragons and The Stairway to Heaven Hills and the Ruby Rock and Roll River."

To my astonishment, Emma handed me more filmy sheets.  This was getting stranger and stranger.

-----
The Information Keepers are a good idea but a lousy way of telling a story.  I need to get good at writing up what they say so that there are stories within this major story.  Good for a rewrite.  Good for adding words to this file, but I really need to get on with the story if there is enough story to tell.  There's always enough story to tell.  Stream of consciousness writing to keep writing I guess.

OK.  Tomorrow is he halfway point and I'm only a bit more than a third of the way there.  I have to pick up the pace somehow.  Ideas.  I have to figure out how to connect dragons more tightly with The Rebel Horde.  What convinces Ronnie to go.

Hollis comes along because his sister thinks he should die because Albert died and this would make Hollin sad so wearing Victoria's widow weeds would be real.  I don't like making Hollin the crazy person but she is definitely unlikeable.  Hollis needs to get out of there.  OK.  Start with that scene and fill the rest of this in some time unless something comes soon.
-----

As crazy as it was sounding, I was becoming convinced I needed to get to the Stairway to Heaven Hills.  How I would find The Rebel Horde I did not know.  Perhaps they would find me.  Gwennore's constant talk of dragons made me very uneasy but maybe I just had dragons on the brain.  I gathered everything up and went off to find Hollis or Lord Stern.  I needed to go south and I suspected they could get me there quickly.

*  Chapter Six:  Heading South
**  Scene 21:  My Proposal
I made my proposal to Lord Stern.  He did not like it.

"Your evidence seems flimsy," he said.

"Your facts, what I have been able to glean from talking to an information keeper who, by the way, has been very helpful, is a very poor way to do research," I shot back.  "You want to me to find a group for which you have virtually no data.  I think the Democracy of Rock and Roll is to the south and I think that would be a very good place for The Rebel Horde to hide.  Besides, their rhetoric seems consistent with anti--royalist leanings and the Democracy of Rock and Roll would be a good place for them to hide out."

"How are you going to find anyone in thousands of square miles of unmapped area?" Lord Stern asked.

"I think if I show up there, The Rebel Horde will find me," I said.

"And if they don't."

"Perhaps I can find some treasure," I said.  "That might make the trip worthwhile."

It was a smart alecky response but I was running out of patience.  This whole exercise seemed pointless.  I was risking my neck for very little return except Gyllian thought it would benefit the human race if I did this and I could not let the whole human race down.  Maybe I had been absorbing Star Runner's obsession with her own race.

Hollis burst through the door that I thought of as Hollis's door.

"Lord Stern!  Lord Stern!" he cried.  "Hollin wants me dead."

You, too, I thought with not much compassion.

"Calm down, Hollis," Lord Stern said.  His tone led me to think this drama had played out before.

"No, she's serious," Hollis said, a bit breathlessly.

The boy certainly knew how to be a drama queen.

"She says Prince Albert died and she can play the part of Queen Victoria much better if I really died.  Then she would be sad and could where the widow weeds much more convincingly.  She says it's been the plan all along."

Lord Stern looked very unhappy.

"Is that what she said to you?" he asked Hollis in a tell me the truth or else voice.  I knew that tone of voice well.

"Yes," the boy said.  "She says I have to drink poison, slow-acting poison, so I'll seem sick and then I have to die."

"She doesn't want you to play at dying," Lord Stern clarified.

"No," Hollis said.  "She wants me dead.  She showed me the picture of my coffin and the plans for my state funeral."

Lord Stern wiped the sweat from his forehead.

I wondered if he had forgotten I was in the room.

Then Lord Stern turned to me.

"I'll have everything prepared," he said.  "You may go.  Teddy and Gwennore will of course accompany you.  And you will take Hollis with you.  I may be able to persuade Hollin to abandon her plan in the interim.  Meanwhile, Hollis will be out of the Royal Precincts and away from harm."

"I'll do it," I said, "under one condition."

"Condition?"  They both turned to me.

"Hollis, you have to do as I say," I said.  "This is a dangerous mission but everyone needs to understand I am in charge.  I cannot have oversight if you run off and get into trouble.  I may not have the resources to rescue you.  We're traveling by river.  Teddy knows about that.  I do not.  We are in search of The Rebel Horde.  They may be dangerous.  We may encounter dragons and they're dangerous, too."

I felt absurd saying this last item.  I really had a hard time believing there were dragons in those hills, but who knew.

"Dragons?  Really?  Will we see any of them?" Hollis was excited again.  He was acting about twelve rather than being an older boy.  But then Hollin was acting about ten with her crazy schemes.

"I don't know if we will see dragons," I said.  "They may eat us before they speak to us.  We need to be careful."

"Can I really go?" Hollis turned to Lord Stern.

"Yes," he said.  The weariness of his tone suggested he was quite tired of dealing with Hollin and Hollis.

Hollis jumped up from the table.  "I'll get a few things," he said.

"We leave in the morning," I said.

But he had already exited through his door and was gone.

"I know his presence will be trying," Lord Stern said. "But I have little alternative at the moment.  He's a good boy, just a bit high strung."

"He should make an interesting contrast to Gwennore," I remarked and got tiredly to my feet.  I had a long night ahead of me.  I had to scan all the flimsy sheets.  Thankfully my wet wiring could analyze them through the scanner and create a useful summary for my limited storage database.  I was getting an idea how limiting Captain Star Runner's mobile memory unit was.  I should have been more understanding of her when we were living in the villa.  But that was long ago, or at least it seemed long ago.

"I hope this is all worth it," I told Lord Stern.

"Me, too," he said.  "All of this," and he gestured to the walls by which I presumed he meant to encompass all of the Royal Province of Debussy-on-La-Mer, "Is getting to be a bit too much."

I wondered, as I made my way back to 202 Green Street, if Lord Stern and I could be friends in another circumstance.  He seemed to have a good head on his shoulders.



**  Scene 22:  On the Stairs
When I stepped onto the landing outside my door, Daniels stepped off the bottom step to the attic and stood there.  The landing is narrow.  It is hard for two people to stand there comfortably.  He was very close.  I am a former police officer.  I am a tall and strong woman.  His presence so close to me unnerved me.  I have many male friends, but there are some men who just give me the willies.  They are usually men who see women as objects.  Daniels did not look at me that way.  He seemed to be evaluating me in some way I could not fathom.

"Good evening, Ms. Camberwell," he finally said before proceeding down the staircase.

He was waiting for me, I thought.  Why?  What reason had he to even notice me.  His presence seemed like intimidation, but to what end.

I had been sailing along on adrenaline.  Now I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted.  I had much to do before morning.
**  Scene 22: Starting Out and heading Away
-----
There are too many scenes for a movie.  The Saving the Cat guy says forty, no more and no less.  I haven't bought that book to read and this is not a movie, but it is an idea which intrigues me.  After ripping twenty-four discs from the latest Elizabeth George mystery, forty scenes seems like a very reasonable approach.  I still cannot believe what Havers is doing.  I'm acting like a six-yea-old reading that book.  I cannot read the next scene because I'm scared for a fictional character.  I'm not scared for my own characters.  I will not do that many bad things to them.  Am I doing enough bad things to Ronnie and what sort of character flaws am I showing up in this novel.  At least in the first two books she was pining away for Star.  She was uncertain in the first book what to do.  That is sort of like this book though for a different reason.  She is overwhelmed by her physical circumstances here.  She knew her place on Hypatia and she does not know it here.  She had a support system of sorts and she has none here.  She is totally alone and although she thinks of herself as a loner, she isn't.  She is faced with the wide open areas of a whole planet while formerly she was limited to the dome over Ptolemy City with some trips outside of it.
-----
We headed out just before dawn.  A ship was to take us down the Afternoon of the Faun River to La Mer and then down the coast to the mouth of the Ruby Rock and Roll River.  That part of the journey was a bit undefined as our maps were imprecise.
----
mouth of the river?  To go downstream we will need to find the headwaters or at least put our paddle in as it is going by.
-----
From a suitable place on the coast, a flying machine--no kidding, that is what they are called--would take us inland to find the Ruby Rock and Roll River.

OK. They do that.

We camped alongside the Ruby Rock and Roll River that night.  We would start our journey on the river in the morning.  Hollis was keyed up.  He chattered incessantly until Teddy threatened to beat him up if he did not stop talking.  Hollis was disbelieving and outraged, but Teddy's angry tone and aggressiveness convinced Hollis that Teddy was Sirius.  Gwennore sang to herself in sounds more than words.  I was just tired and anxious.

I slept poorly.  In the morning we were off.

The looping nature of the Ruby Rock and Roll River had convinced me it would be difficult to navigate.  However, we moved along fairly easily, the river taking us where it went.  Teddy and Hollis were in one boat while Gwennore and I occupied the other.  I had expected primitive means of locomotion, but these were advanced craft that basically ran themselves.  We just sat there and watched the riverbanks.

it was the riverbanks which surprised Teddy and me.  Hollis was excited about everything and Gwennore had her own mono log which was incoherent as far as I could tell.

What surprised Teddy and me were all the abandoned buildings along the riverbanks.  We saw burned out cabins, tumbled down shacks and buildings which just had the foundations left.  Every once in a while we saw the ruins of what must have been castles.  The river flowed on and the evidence of former habitation continued.

It was like the ride I once went on.  We were in a boat that went down a river.  We saw a cabin set ablaze and underwent an attack.  We saw dangerous animals come to drink at the river's edge before we turned back.  That was how Ruby Rock and Roll River was, like an amusement park ride.  There were birds in the air and fish in the river.  That was all the wildlife we saw.  The whole area was an unfinished toy land like the ones at winter festival time back home.

*  Chapter Seven:  Aboard the As Yet Unnamed or Looked Up Ride
** Section Twenty-two:  Gyllian Thinks About the Mission
-----
I've always found it easier to write in the first person.  That has worked well for Captain Star Runner's adventures though I did try another point of view in *Library of the Mind* early on.  I abandoned it quickly.  However, in this novel, something will be lost if the reader does not know what is happening elsewhere.  Everything needs to come together at or near the end.
-----
Gyllian put down her coffee mug on the table in the Lounge.  How many cups did this make today?  If she really wanted to know the answer to her question, she could ask Christabel, Captain Star Runner's AI.  Christabel would be able to provide this information.  Gyllian did not want to know the numbers of cups of coffee she had drunk.  Her question reflected her anxiety over her mission.

Captain Star Runner was also concerned.  Gyllian might have said he was nervous as a cat, but Captain Star Runner would not have appreciated a reference to him as a cat nor would he be particularly pleased with her thinking of him as a he.  Star maintained his identification with it as he was an ungendered Pantheran.  Because Ronnie Camberwell was a lesbian, she insisted on calling him she.

Thinking about Star was also a distraction from thinking about the mission.  Gyllian knew Star continually paced the length of the spaceship.  Christabel kept trying to balance his metabolism.  Gyllian knew the outward signs of that.  Christabel was no doubt trying to balance Star's need to calm down with the need to have Star alert and able to run the ship.  Star could not do that if he was drugged into a stupor.  Nor could Star search for and identify insert ion and extraction points.  That took a clear mind and a quiet one.  Star had once described the process as opening his mind and sensing.  He did not so much look as get a feeling.  Gyllian did not think even the Pantherans really understood the process.  Star claimed to be the best at it.  Gyllian had no reason to question this assertion, but then on the other hand, Star, like any other Pantheran Gyllian had ever met,  was arrogant and how could she know if the Pantheran military had created star runners with as good or better sensing capabilities as Star.

She had not heard any more from Emily Dickinson and that worried her, too.  Eberhard was erratic.  He had been a rising star in the Solar League's military intelligence when she, too, worked there.  His drinking and tendency to shoot off his mouth proved to be his undoing.  Eberhard had bounced around for a while and then moved to Hypatia,, outside the Coalition borders, where he had first become a hired assassin and then later became the comic Emily Dickinson.  Star had met Eberhard there and they had had a brief affair. His exploits before coming to Hypatia were murky but did involve being a hired gun and trouble, lots of trouble.  Trouble seemed to always follow Eberhard wherever he went.  Gyllian would not have involved him in this mission except that he and Josh Levins were the only two people she knew who could do the things she needed done to complete her own work.  Josh had a good working relationship with the Fungusian Network and Gyllian had never mastered that.  Josh was linked to Ronnie and Ronnie was linked to Star and that formed Josh's connection.  Gyllian was not sure why her connection to Star had not created the same access for her.  Perhaps it was her position in the Ministry of Defense for the Alliance of Planets.  Perhaps it was her lack of real understanding of networks.  In either case, Gyllian needed Josh to make those connections.  Eberhard could do things that were illegal.  He could disappear for a while, go beyond the Alliance's jurisdiction.  Gyllian could not.  She needed to keep her hands as clean as possible.

-----
Lots here to clarify: Emily Dickinson's background, scattered through many of Star's adventures.  More info about Star's relationship to Emily Dickinson and the back story between Eberhard and Gyllian.  They were, too, lovers at one point and Emily Dickinson's whereabouts at any given time in the story arc is confused.  A good project for after Nanowrimo will be doing a profile of all the characters, especially the subordinant ones, to get their stories straight.  I wonder how I will make a time line.

** Section Twenty-Five:  Star's Revelation
Star padded into the lounge.

"Anything?" Gyllian asked.

"Something quite unusual," Star said. His voice 

always sounded like he was about to meow.  For such a large animal, his voice sounded high.

"What is quite unusual," Gyllian prompted.  She wanted to snap at him but Star would tell her in his own time.  He wanted to impress her with what he had discovered.

"There's an insertion point quite near to Marathon," Star announced.  "I have never encountered one so close to a planet before."

So this circumstance was unusual.

"Why is that?" Gyllian asked.

Star gave one of his elaborate shrugs which involved both his shoulders and his hindquarters.

"I am not engineered for the scientific explanations of things," he said.  His tone was dismissive.  "You asked me to locate insertion and extraction points.  I am doing that."

"And is an extraction point so close to a planet usable?" Gyllian asked.  "Can you use it?  Can the Pantheran military use it?"

Star paced around the table, clearing thinking.  When Star thought, it was a dialog between himself and the AI Christabel.

Star said, "I could probably use it as an insertion point.  Knowing that the planet is quite nearby, I could probably use it as an extraction point.  This is a fairly small ride with a much smaller mass than a military vehicle.  If military vehicles used this as an extraction point, two things are likely to be true.  1. They will not know how close to the planet they are.  2.  They will be traveling very fast in Mother Space.  This could result in having an affect on their trajectories and thus affecting their performance."

"In what way?"

Star said, "If they came through the extraction point prepared to shoot, guns ablazing I think you would say, they might end up shooting each other or being pushed around by the planet's gravity.  Christabel does not have any data of this and I have no experience of this.""""

And you don't know the capabilities of Pantheran military vehicles built since your time as a star runner, Gyllian thought.  She made a note to have Star updated with any military intelligence the Alliance had on that matter.  Perhaps she should also ask Star to have the Fungusians update his database as well.

Disarray sounded like a good idea, but having Pantheran military vessels bursting out of hyperspace so near Marathon frightened her.

"Is this extraction point hard to find?" she asked.

"Very," Star said, pride evident in his manner.  "How can I explain it to you?" he asked aloud, beginning to pace again.  "It is as if the point comes and goes, as if it is visible and then it disappears.  It took me some time to focus on it as if its signal is very weak.  I do not want to explore this point, Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo.  Opening it and going into hyperspace could make it more visible to others."

Gyllian wondered what Star meant so she asked him to explain.

"My teacher at the Institute of Genetic Design described insert and extraction points as weaknesses in the fabric of Mother Space.  Some of these weaknesses are true holes.  You just go through them.  Any star runner can find these holes and they can be mapped.  Most of your Terry jump gates use these  holes.  The gate does not open and close them exactly.  It more or less shapes them for you and holds them wide open so your vehicles can go through.  The holes do not totally close when you are through. This point is a small weakness rather than a hole.  If I go through it, it may become a hole or the fabric of Mother Space will become weaker.  That means another star runner, who does not have my abilities, would be more likely to find it."

Gyllian said, "So we could use it as an escape route, right?"

Star continued his pacing.  His tail began to twitch.  This was not a good sign.  He was agitated.  Gyllian could not see why.  A hidden insertion point sounded like an ace in the hole should the Pantheran military burst out of hyperspace.

Star said, "If we inserted ourselves into Mother Space using that insertion point, it would open it up.  The military could pursue us.  They are faster than this ride and could either destroy us or capture us.  If anyone goes through this point, it will affect the revolution of Marathon around its sun.  If we go through, the affect will be very small.  It could leash tsunamis, cause earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.  If a squadron of military vehicles goes through the point, it will intensify this reaction and either destroy the planet or cause its revolution around its sun to change.  This revolution could be closer to the sun than it is currently at some points and farther away at other points or the revolution could be closer to its sun or farther away from its sun.  In any of these scenarios, it will cause catastrophic loss of life.

Gyllian felt ill.  What Captain Star Runner described was a cataclysm beyond her experience.  She said, So to preserve Marathon,no one should ever use that point either into or out of hyperspace."

"That is correct," Star Runner said.  "The proper thing to do is to mark that area of Mother Space so anyone finding that point will know not to use it."

"And will the Pantheran military respect such a sign?"

Gyllian could not imagine how a hyperspace sign worked, but Star seemed to accept such a phenominon as normal.

"This is not a Coalition star system," Star said.  "It is populated by Terries who resisted The Race and ran away and hid during that war long ago.  In our history, your Second Expansion War is labeled as a rebellion.  These Terries are the descendants of rebels and not just rebels, but deserters.  As deserters, they can be destroyed without penalty."

Gyllian was horrified.

"So the Pantherans are trying to find these people to destroy them?"

Captain Star Runner had not mentioned this before.  All her intelligence had not mentioned this before.

"I do not know what their intentions are.  However, it would be legal to do so," Star said.  "As Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell is on Marathon, I will do anything I can to preserve her life."

And that was Star's bottom line, Gyllian thought.  Star did not much care what happen to the people who lived here.  Star might or might not care what happened to The Czarina and Captain Kidd.  For that matter, Star might not even care what happened to her, but Ronnie was a different matter altogether.

Gyllian did not hope to understand their relationship.  She knew perfectly well someone's desire for Captain Star Runner as a lover.  Although she herself was now in a long-term relationship with a man, her love making with Star was still the most amazing experience she had ever had.  Being in this ride with him week after week made her reconsider her promise to be monogamous on a regular basis.  Star would move heaven and earth for Ronnie Camberwell.  She rather suspected Ronnie would do the same for Star yet they were a very unlikely couple.  They always seemed on the verge of getting together or breaking up.  In fact, they had dissolved their union.  Currently they were not in an official union.  Yet here it was, Star's insistence he save Ronnie no matter what happened.

"Is there anything we can do?" Gyllian finally asked.

"Pick up Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell, The Czarina and Captain William Kidd and leave this area of space."  Captain Star Runner was definite.  No hesitation.  No wavering.  Star, Gyllian realized,  thought they ought to leave the this region of space.

"And what about the people living here?" Gyllian asked.

"What about them?" Star asked.

"We would have led the Pantherans to them so we would be responsible for their deaths." Gyllian said.  This situation was deteriorating rapidly.  Star controlled the ship.  Star would act if he felt he or Ronnie were at risk.

Again Star shrugged.  Gyllian watched his muscles move under his luxuriant fuchsia-colored coat.  She remembered how that coat felt against her skin and how she had buried her hands and her face into his soft and shiny fur.  Watching him move almost distracted her from the gravity of the conversation.

Star said, "You wanted to solve a mystery.  Coming here solved that mystery.  You said it was in your government's interest to solve the mystery.  You will be able to confirm any activity in this area of space which you believe is objectionable after the destruction of these planets.  You can bring your grievance to the Coalition Council through The Solar League if you wish.  Otherwise, you can simply let it be known what happened."

Gyllian met Star's declaration with outrage.

"Don't you care that millions of people will be killed?"

This time Star did not shrug but turned to face her across the table.  He had to put his paws on a chair to do that.

"No, I do not," Star said.  "You may have forgotten, but these people you are so worried about saving," and here Star emphasized the word, "refused to have anything to do with me because I am a member of The Race.  They would have no difficulty destroying me.  They have no difficulty preparing to destroy Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell.  They have no difficulty wasting my time looking for insertion and extraction points that some rumored military force may or may not use.  It would be far more profitable for me to engage in trade.  It would be far more enjoyable for me to spend time with Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell.  It would be far more preferable that Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell be safe and working somewhere else."

And there it was, Gyllian thought, Star's concern for Ronnie and Star's displeasure at wasting time in this region of space on this mission.  The fate of humanity in the Coalition and outside of it was no real concern to him.  Gyllian suspected that if Star thought Tamara was at risk, he would collect Ronnie and go immediately to rescue her.  As for the rest of them, they were secondary.

To be fair to Star, if he thought any of them, Emily Dickinson, The Czarina, Captain Kidd or even Josh Levins were in trouble, he would probably do his best to rescue them.  Star had proven that before.  Star had a conscience of sorts.  Star tried to understand human feelings.  Star tried to be a friend.  These bigger concepts of loyalty and right and wrong were, it seemed, beyond his ability to grasp.  Gyllian knew this was his training and conditioning at the Institute of Genetic Design.  Star Runner was a tool of Pantheran society.  He was never intended to be a full member of that society with the ability or education to sort through all the different permutations of right and wrong imposed on a member of society.  When his usefulness to that society ended, Star had been expected to voluntarily come forward for termination.  Star had not done that.  That Star could operate independently as he had was a testimony to his tenaciousness and his intelligence.  He had exceeded his design parameters.  And not, Gyllian thought, in no small measure to his contact with these same human beings.


Gyllian thought, I must remember Captain Star Runner is not human.  Captain Star Runner is an alien.  More to the point, Captain Star Runner is a complicated, highly sophisticated tool of the Pantheran Empire.  The tool is not under the direct control of that empire.  In a very real sense, this tool of theirs had malfunctioned.  Star was standing here in front of her for two reasons:

1.  The Pantherans had an almost superstitious regard for fuchsia-colored Pantherans.  They were extremely rare.  The last fuchsia-colored Pantheran had started the Institution of Genetic Design.  Gyllian did not know the details of why the fuchsia-colored Pantheran did this.
2.  Gyllian herself had been instrumental in preventing Star's most recent avoidance of termination.  The Pantherans had been willing to overlook Star's presence during their last two incursions into the Pharaoh Star System.  It was unclear if they would overlook Star's presence here.  In all honesty, Gyllian could not disagree with Star's desire to be somewhere else.

But she had to complete this mission successfully.  She had to save these people from the Pantherans should they be looking for them.
** Scene Twenty-Three:  A Message From Emily Dickinson Arrives
Christabel spoke through Gillian's wet wiring.  They had agreed that Gyllian would allow Christabel to do so.  It relieved Star of having Christabel speak in his mind and over the ship's intercom at the same time.  It was not precisely the same time.  That was he problem.  The amplified synthetic speech overlapped the internal mono log.  Star found it confusing and irritating.

"What is it?" Gyllian asked.  She had insisted her private messages be kept private.  She doubted they were.  Curiosity and voyeurism were part of Star's nature.

Eberhard said, "Sorry, Gyllie.  This has taken longer than I expected.  My sources were reluctant to be found much less talk.  The cats are on the move.  They've beefed up their border patrols.  There have been rumors of incursions into frontier space, both southern and northern.  There are several squadrons missing from their usual deployment patterns.  Rumors are running rampant.  I would share them with you, but they really don't amount to much.  There's talk of opening up new worlds for colonization.  Mazo Manie, the new top cat, is promoting this as positive for the Coalition.  Let me know what else you want me to do.  I'll keep my ear to the ground, but I have rung my sources pretty dry and I may have burned a few bridges in the process if you know what I mean."

Gyllian did know what he meant.  All this information was extremely worrisome.  She said aloud, "What do you think of Emily Dickinson's report?"

**  Section Twenty-Four:  Christabel's Input
Into the mental silence which followed Eberhard's report, Christabel said, "The Fungusian Network can confirm Emily Dickinson's report.  Two (unpronounceable Pantheran word) squadrons have been detached from their usual assignments.  Their trajectories indicate they are not proceeding jointly but may be on two separate missions."

Strange, Gyllian thought, that Christabel would use the Pantheran word for themselves but use Star's references for the Fungusian Network and Eberhard.  She could just as easily translated the Pantheran to Members of the Race.  No, that was not correct.  In this context it would be simply Ourselves.  A squadron of the Members of the Race or an Ourselves squadron?  A silly distraction.  She must be quite unnerved by Eberhard's report and the Fungusian confirmation.

When Gyllian focused on the room around her, Star was no longer in the Lounge.

"Star Runner?"

There was no immediate response but the sound of the ship had changed.

"Where are we going?" Gyllian asked.

Star's voice came over the ship's speakers.  "It is easier to pick up The Czarina and Captain William Kidd first.  Then we will find Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell.  Then we will leave this region of space.  We will need to confirm the safety of Security Analyst Josh Levins as well."

Gyllian wanted to protest, that she was in charge of this mission, that Captain Star Runner's unilateral decision to abort the mission was premature and uncalled for.  He was a contractor and therefore would void his contract if he failed to complete all mission requirements.  But Gyllian knew that it would be a waste of time to discuss this with the fuchsia-colored Pantheran.  Star himself wanted no part of a face-to-face encounter with part of the Pantheran Fleet nor did he want any of his friends put at risk.  And for what, he had already argued, a band of renegade[D[D[D[D[C[C[C[C human beings in whom he had no interest whatsoever?

The question was, Gyllian thought, once Star had gotten everyone together, where would they go and how?  What would the Pantherans do when they arrived in the star system if indeed they were coming here.  Were they coming here?  Would all her work to establish a toe hold with the Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer be for naught or could she continue that fragile relationship after her removal from the star system?  Captain Star Runner could be so infuriating but his abilities far out ranked his behavior most of the time.

Retrieving The Czarina and Captain Kidd proved to be a straight forward exercise.  They were surprised they had been pulled out so abruptly.

"I will really miss going to the masquerade ball," The Czarina said, "but I certainly don't want to be obliterated by the Pantherans."

"Don't worry, my dear," Captain Kidd comforted her, "you will have an opportunity to wear your outfit at another time."

"But I will not be able to write about it," The Czarina said.

"Just make something up," Captain Kidd said.  "No one will know anyway."

With this, The Czarina cheered up and began working on yet another blog post she would publish later.  Gyllian had impressed upon her the necessity of silence until the mission was behind them and Gyllian judged it would have little consequence if The Czarina once again told her vast audience of her daring adventures in a far corner of the  galaxy.
*  Chapter Eight:  Ronnie and Star are Reunited
**  Section Twenty-Five: The Spaceship in the Sky
The Rock and Roll River was passing through a lovely valley.  I suspected there had once been farms here.  The rolling hills seemed to be dotted with decaying structures.  At the head of the valley we had passed a great ruin.  Hollis declared it to be a castle.  He may well have been right.  I was getting a picture that this land had once supported nobility with a large agrarian population.  I so far had seen no evidence of towns which surprised me.  On the other hand, the towns could have been inland at crossroads.  There were few natural harbors along the Ruby Rock and Roll River.  Perhaps wharfs or even canals had long ago collapsed and have been swallowed up with time and the inexorable claim of the forest which often came down to the banks of the river.
-----
Sections seem to be a better title for these short pieces rather than scenes.  Scenes suggest one location.  Some of the locations have extended action or dialog.  I am so looking forward to reaching the halfway point.  Then finishing on time will seem much more doable.
-----
A sound came to us across the tranquil valley.

"What's that?" Teddy asked, looking around him, becoming quite vigilant.

"It sounds like a motor," Hollis said.  Excitement seemed to infuse everything he said.  "Maybe it's The Rebel Horde coming to meet us at last."

"The dragons be coming," Gwennore said.

I directed the boats to bring us to the riverbank.  We hauled them up beyond the water, gathered up our personal possessions and began walking toward the place where the ride would come to ground.  There was no danger I knew.  The advanced design of the ride made it possible to come fairly close to it as it descended without getting blasted by heat or radiation.  Smoothly the ride settled itself.  By the pitch of the engines, I knew Captain Star Runner did not plan to stay here.  This was what the spacers called a touch and go.  We would come aboard and then Star would blast off again into space.  I wondered what would become of the boa

I personally have never thought of dragons traveling by motorized vehicle, but why not?  I doubted we would be met by actual dragons.  But when the craft became visible, I knew at once  what it was.  It was a spaceship.  In particular, it was Captain Star Runner's ride.  I could tell by its distinctive shape and color.  The rainbow writing on its side also distinguished it.
**  Section Twenty-Six:Coming Aboard  
As usual, Star ability to pinpoint a landing area near where Ronnie and the others were was unerring.  Gyllian knew Star had little experience with planetary landfall, but since his return from the neighboring arm of the galaxy, his abilities were greatly enhanced and obviously planet landings were part of that new skill set.

"four human beings," Christabel announced.

"I thought there were only three," Gyllian responded.

"Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell is among them," Captain Star Runner put in.  That was all he cared about.

"What shall we do with the others?" Christabel asked Gyllian.

"Let's gather them up," Gyllian said.  "Are you able to confine them in some way until we can interrogate them?  I don't know who they all are and I have the sense they might not all be friends.  Let's keep our communications via wet wire."

"I am assembling restraints as we speak," Christabel said.  "I will immobilize them all and then move them into the cargo area."

"Not Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell," Star objected immediately.

"I will do all of them so they do not suspect we know Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell," Christabel soothed.  "As soon as we have them separated, I will release her and she can join us.  I am sure we will have much to discuss.  I am also deactivating any devices they may have on them.  I will also send bots to retrieve their boats.  I am assuming you want no trace of them to remain."

Her question was phrased as a statement.

"Good thinking," Gyllian said.  She was annoyed at Christabel's presumption, pleased at the AI's grasp of the situation and displeased with her own slowness to give orders.

"We will play the part of The Rebel Horde at least at the outset until we have a better picture of what's going on," she said.

"Agreed."  Star and Christabel were in sync with each other.  No surprise there.
The Travelers Come Aboard
"They are coming," Christabel announced.  The large view screen in the lounge came to life.  Gyllian saw four human beings coming toward the ship.  One was Ronnie.  They were two men and another woman.  Gyllian guessed the second woman was Gwennore.  She was a short pudgy woman with long tangled hair.  If she had not been wearing an orange jump suit Gyllian might have described her as a witch.  There was a man of medium height, heavy set with short hair.  This must be Teddy, the shadower.  Gyllian had no idea who the tall kid was.  He ran ahead of the others, anxious to be the first.  Ronnie came last, striding along, but watchful.  They all looked unkempt and dirty as if they had been living rough as they probably had been doing since they left Capital City.

As Gyllian watched, the devices Christabel had activated came down the ramp.  They were smart things, of course, assembling themselves to perform the task or tasks Christabel had set them to. The ones that would carry the boats were strong stevedore types.  They moved past the human beings.  The three Capital City natives stopped and stared.  Ronnie gestured them to move on.  The audio pickups outside the ship relayed her words.

"Never mind them.  Come along, Hollis.  Gwennore, Teddy, let's go."

"I wonder what else they have inside," the tall kid said.

"Dragons," Gwennore responded.

Teddy said nothing at all but watched as the smaller items rolled toward them.

Before any of them could move, the smart things wrapped around them, immobilizing them and shutting down all electronic devices, if any.  The group of four was unable to run and unable to communicate.  A hush field deployed around them.

"You immobilized Ronnie as well," Gyllian said.

"She could be carrying something or have been implanted with something," Christabel said.  "Besides, we do not want her companions to know she is special."

"Not at this time," Gyllian agreed.

"I do not like this," Star said.

"She is not hurt," Christabel said.  "We will put everything to rights shortly.  "You two stay put.  I want to bring each of them aboard separately and isolate them.  Then we can hear Ronnie's report."

A security bot emerged from the ship and escorted the four humans one by one into the cargo hold where cubicles awaited them.  Ronnie was the last to come on board.  The bot escorted her to the lounge.

"Sorry about the restraints," Gyllian said to her immediately.  "We were creating a story line."

"Can I get out of this now?" Ronnie asked.

"Of course," Christabel said.  "Restoring wet wiring connectivity now."

The restraints dropped away and returned to the cargo hold.

"I want a shower and some decent food," Ronnie said.

"As soon as you give us a report," Gyllian said.

The stevedores returned with the boats and stowed them.  The ramp withdrew into the ship.  The cargo hatch closed and Star initiated blast off.  Gyllian had no idea where they were going but a quick departure seemed best.  Captain Star Runner was wasting no time at all.  The whole operation had taken less than fifteen minutes.

##  Section Twenty-Seven:  Ronnie's Report Leads to a Plan

"I see we're all here," Ronnie said, dropping into a chair.  "I cannot tell you how glad I am to be back aboard.  I never thought I would say this, but the ship was a sight for sore eyes."

"We're glad to have you back, dear," The Czarina said.  "Now tell us everything, including who that boy is."

"That boy is Prince Hollis," Ronnie said.  "He came along because his sister, Queen Hollin, has decided he should die of poison so that she can be more convincing
in her role as the old, grieving queen, Victoria.  Lord Stern thought it best to remove him from the Royal Precincts."

The Czarina said, "You'll have to give me all the background.  This sounds like a juicy series indeed.  I can probably sell this one for wider distribution."

"Later," Gyllian said.  "Why were you on that river."

"As far as I can tell," Ronnie said, "this seems like the best place to find The Rebel Horde.  We haven't been contacted yet.  I've seen a lot of abandoned and destroyed buildings.  Many look like they have been left to fall apart.  I think they have been derelict for some time."

"Anything else?" Gyllian asked.

"When Gwennore saw the ship," Ronnie said, "she said the word dragons.  She says that a lot.  I think there is some connection between The Rebel Horde and dragons, at least in her mind.  She is a very strange person."

"I have more," Christabel announced.

"Your scans?" Gyllian asked.

"Yes.  All three of your companions, Ronnie, are carrying devices, but no two devices are the same.  The men may be carrying locally made devices.  They will need closer examination to indicate their purpose.  The woman you call Gwennore is carrying one that is in my database and therefore is made off world."

The people in the lounge went silent.  They were listening to Christabel over the speakers as neither The Czarina or Captain Kidd were wet-wired.

"Don't keep us in suspense," Gyllian said.

"The devise is a Pantheran communications device," Christabel said.  "It is rudimentary.  It can send a signal to a spaceship and receive a signal.  It is not for hyperspace communication.  The ship needs to be in orbit."

"Does it have a log?" Gyllian asked.

"Downloading it now," Christabel said.  "I will have it analyzed shortly."

Ronnie said, "You mean I've been with someone who is in touch with the Pantherans?"

"It looks that way," Gyllian said.

They heard Star growl.

"Not you," Ronnie was quick to add.

"I know, Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell," Star said.  "I was growling about having such a device near you."

Christabel said, "There's a list of commits, but nothing has been pushed to a vehicle.  The text is confusing.  I will translate as best I can."

The screen filled with text.

am getting the impression dragons is a name for Pantherans."

"This is the way Gwennore speaks," Ronnie said,, scanning the text on the screen.  "She refers to dragons all the time.  I assumed dragons referred to The Rebel Horde.  From this, I 

"Do you hear that, Captain," Captain Kidd said.  "You're a dragon, not a cat."

Another growl issued from the speakers.

"I think Captain Kidd has something here," Ronnie said.  "Gwennore might believe Star is the dragon she wants to give these messages to."

Gyllian smiled at Ronnie.  "I like that idea.  We can find out more if we can pose the right questions."

"If we are a Pantheran ship, we need to release them soon and give them showers, food and a bed," Ronnie said.  "In fact, I'm off to do that."

Ronnie turned to Gyllian.  "You script this.  Just let me know my part."  And she left the lounge.

**  Section Twenty-Seven: Ronnie
I went to my stateroom, stripped off my filthy jump suit and threw them into the recycler.  I tapped in a request for replacement clothing and stepped thankfully into the shower unit.  I felt the dirt being removed from my skin and knew the medical scan was progressing.  While the ship tended to my body, I tried to process what I had just learned.
-----
I will need to gather together all the references for dragons and see how they fit together as references to Pantherans.
-----
I tried to remember everything I knew about Gwennore.  She was beautiful.  When she cleaned up, everyone would see that.  She definitely thought in different ways than anyone I ever met before.  I often wondered if she was mentally ill.  She lived in Mrs. Farnesworth's house in a poor neighborhood of Capital City.  I had no idea how she supported herself.

Something niggled at the back of my mind.  I could not pull it up.

"Ronnie," Christabel said.

"Here," I replied through the wet wiring.

"The name Daniels comes up.  Does that mean anything to you?"

I shivered involuntarily.

"Not a good word," Christabel commented.

"A scary person who lives in the attic apartment in my house.  He lives on the top floor, then me then Gwennore then the ground floor where Mrs. Farnesworth lives."

"And someone named Poppy," Christabel said.

"Mrs. Farnesworth," I said.

"They are all Pantheran agents," Christabel told me.  "I think Daniels is the muscle and Mrs. Farnesworth is the chief contact."

"Where does Gwennore fit and why have the messages not been sent?" I asked.

"There is no indication of why," Christabel said.  "I would have to interrogate the other devices to know."

"We can ask," Ronnie said.

"It's a question in the queue," Christabel said.

Ronnie said, stepping out of the shower cubicle, "I am concerned about Star getting off script."

"I can monitor and prompt," Christabel said.

Christabel is always confident how well she can manage Star.  For the most part, she can, but Star is a ham at heart and might overdue her part.

**  Section Twenty-Eight: What To Ask

Gyllian poured herself yet another cup of coffee.  One by one, they had allowed the others to take showers and clean up.  Captain Kidd had seen to that.  A bit of a ham himself, he had played the part of a pirate.  Gyllian was not certain Pantherans would have done that, but she hoped the trio in the cargo area had no acquaintance with how Pantherans lived and worked aboard their ships.  She kept going over the questions they wanted to know.

Ronnie came back into the lounge.

"Feeling better?" Gyllian asked.

"Much, thanks," Ronnie said.  "Is that coffee?"

"Help yourself," Gyllian said.

Ronnie did.

Returning to the table Ronnie said, "Christabel tells me all the people in my hose back in Capital City are involved, but no messages have been sent which are on Gwennore's device."

"Does that make any sense to you?" Gyllian asked.  "I cannot figure out the end game here."

"Maybe there isn't one," Ronnie said.  "I've been thinking, too.  Whatever it is, they're all involved.  None of them have treated me very well.  Gwennore has been the friendliest though I think her thought processes are quite confused.  Though from time to time she says something I can construe as accurate."

"And how is that?" Gyllian asked.

"Gwennore has some sense that what happens inside the Royal Precincts is not the same as what happens in the rest of Capital City.  She's right about that.  She talks a lot about dragons and we're drawing the conclusion she means Pantherans though I cannot make the connection myself.  Maybe a Pantheran told her they were dragons and maybe they met her in this part of the continent.  Maybe her screwy thinking is a result of such a meeting."

"Whatever we think," Gyllian said, "it's time for Star to interview them.  Christabel and I have impressed on him the necessity to keep to the script.  We're watching from here.  You probably need to go and join the others."

Ronnie made a face.

"They smell better."

"I'll do it for Hollis," she said.  "I cannot figure out how he fits into any of this."

And she left and went into the cargo bay.

**  Section Twenty-Nine: Playing the Scene

Captain Star Runner was magnificent.  The Czarina declared this at dinner that evening and the others wholeheartedly agreed.

The most surprising piece of information to come out of the interrogation was how frightening Star could be when Star growled.  Ungendered Pantherans, to their chagrin, do not roar.  However, their growl is very fierce.  Star's old friends had heard Star growl, but they did not understand hat Star was holding back.  Star chose to give a full-throated growl while interviewing the people in the cargo bay.

It went something like this when Star entered an area of the cargo bay set up with a table and chairs::

Hollis:  Who are you?

Star:  I am the captain of this ride.  

Gyllian had wanted Star to say ship but Star insisted a Pantheran would say ride so ride it was.

"I am Prince Hollis, and I demand--

Star growled, twitching its tails menacingly.

Hollis:  I am Prince Hollis.  Do you know what that means?

Star:  That you are a spoiled brat who your sister wants to get rid of.

Hollis bit his lip.  His one attempt at vibrato failed immediately.

Teddy:  When can we get off of this dump.

Another growl.

Teddy: You don't scare me.  You're all growl and no muscle.  I bet I could take you on.

He got up from his chair and rushed Star.  Star swatted him with its paw, knocking Teddy down.  Then Star planted that paw on Teddy's back.  Teddy could not move.Christabel summoned the restraints and they quickly immobilized Teddy which was good.  Star's strength would not have lasted very much longer.

Gwennore: Are you really a dragon?

She was, as Ronnie had predicted, quite beautiful.

Star:  Yes,You have one of my devices.

Gwennore:  Taken. Not transmit.

Star:  I have read your messages.

Everyone hoped Gwennore would explain them.  Except for the names, the messages appeared to be garbled and not of any usefulness.

Gwennore, indicating Ronnie: I watch her.  She is a dragon hunter.  You need to be wise about her.

Star looked Ronnie over critically.

Star to Gwennore: What is so special about this one?

Gwennore: She is a foreigner? 

Gwennore said this as if that explained everything.

Star: What difference does that make?  You are all Terrans.

Gwennore did not know that word.

Star: You are all humans. 

Star said this as if the word left a nasty taste in its mouth.  

Star: None of you are Members of the Race.

Ronnie, Gyllian, The Czarina and Captain Kidd were certain this was Star's own ad-lib[D[D[D[C[C[C, but it was in perfect character for a Pantheran.

Gwennore: She is a different color

Star gave one of its elaborate shrugs of shoulders and hind quarters.  "Members of the Race are different colors."

Gwennore: But she is dark ,Dark hair, dark eyes, brown skinned.  She is foreign.

Star: So you and Daniels and Poppy all thought she was special for that reason? 

Star's tone suggested it thought this statement preposterous.

Gwennore: She is not from Capital City.  She is foreign.  Dragons ask us to note strange things
Star:  Agreed.

Star dismissed her.

Hollis:  What will happen to us?

Star:  I haven't decided yet.  You will stay on my ride until I decide.

Hollis:  Lord Stern will look for me.

Star:  Who is Lord Stern.

Hollis:  The Royal Protector of the Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer.

Star shrugged.

Star:  Just another Terran.

Hollis jumped from his chair.

Hollis:  You don't even look like a dragon.  You look like a big fluffy cat.

That was a very bad thing to say to Captain Star Runner.  Star walked up to Hollis who was much taller than Star and pushed the boy over with a paw.  Star stood over him.

Star:  Never call me that again.

The growl was terrifying and right in Hollis's face.

Hollis:  I'm sorry.  I did not mean it.  Of course you are a dragon.  I just never met a dragon before and I did not know what expect.

Star batted him with his paw.

Star: Silence.

And then Star walked out of the room, tail high.

Hollis lay on the floor snuffling.

Ronnie sat motionless.  How could she ever have thought these people were normal human beings.  Teddy's actions had been folly, but at least his reactions were fairly normal.

**  Section Thirty:  Later

We had agreed that I would take my meals with my river companions to see if they said anything to me.  Of course all their communications were monitored.  We had further agreed that I would go up onto the upper level of the ride whenever possible.

When we were eating, Hollis said to no one in particular, "None of you came to my aid when that dragon attacked me."

"I was a bit out of commission," Teddy said.  "You acted like a baby.  No wonder that dragon swatted you like a kitten."

That was exactly what Star had done.  Star's claws were not extended They were when Star had struck Teddy.

"The dragon was very angry .
    
with both of you," Gwennore said very clearly and coherently.  "they are very powerful.  They will rule the world soon."

"A silly-looking creature like that," Teddy scoffed.  "Not likely.  They'll have to deal with us."

"Us?" I asked.  Did he mean the government of The Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer."

"No, you stupid cow," Teddy said.  "Us, the so-called Rebel Horde.  We'll take over all the self-indulgent monarchies run by sissies like this one and they'll have somebody to reckon with."

"You are part of The Rebel Horde?" I asked.

"What do you think, brown cow?"

"But what about all the reports, the Democracy of Rock and Roll, your father's friend?"

"I made all of that up."  Teddy sneered.  "And you fell for it.  Gwennore over here helped, did not you?  She told how her landlady thought you were from there so I just gilded the lily."

"And what purpose was there for leading me here?" I asked.  "Were you supposed to rendezvous with the dragons?"

"No way," Teddy said.  "We were going to let you go on a little farther and then hold you for ransom.  We figured Stern and his cronies wanted you back.  The  pot got very sweet when Hollis came along.  That was what was taking so long.  We needed extra people and supplies because there were more of you."

"And now we are all kid napped by the dragons and maybe they don't know how to return us." Hollis wailed.  "I hate all of you.  I hate the dragons.  I hate Hollin and all her silly ideas."  With this he jumped up from the table and ran to his sleeping chamber, slamming the door.

"Stupid kid," Teddy said.  "I hope I get a chance to lop off his head."

I put down my fork.

"Hollis isn't a bad kid," I said.  "He's just scared."

With that I got up from my chair and walked to my sleeping chamber, letting the door close behind me.  Mine had a back door and I was soon upstairs with the other.
**  Section Thirty-One:  What Next?

When Ronnie joined the others upstairs, The Czarina was saying to Star, "You magnificent animal.  I thought that boy would pee in his pants when you swatted at him."

"He did pee in his pants," Ronnie said, sitting down at the table and helping herself to the dessert.  Captain Kidd gallantly poured her a fresh cup of coffee.

"What's up with him anyway?" Gyllian asked.

"Teddy, for all his crassness, is right," Ronnie said.  "Hollis is a spoiled brat, a boy playing at being a man.  he is totally unprepared to act responsibly."  Ronnie looked around the table.  "Does anyone care that he called me a cow and a brown cow at that."

"It is quite shameful," The Czarina announced.  "I am writing it up as an example of poor training by the upper classes of the lower classes.  Now I don't believe in a stratified society, but in societies of this nature, everyone should respect everyone else."

"But they don't, dear" Captain Kidd said.  "Teddy is trying to be better than he is and failing miserably.  What he needs is to work on a pirate ship and truly earn his keep.  The boy could benefit by that, too.  I suspect our Teddy would break before the boy."

Ronnie privately agreed with Captain Kidd's observations.

Star said, "I do not want you returning to the cargo area, Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell.  I do not like you being near those people."

"What reason can you give for her removal?" Gyllian asked.

"I need to give none at all.  I am the captain," Captain Star Runner said.

"They are already suspicious of her," Gyllian said.  "Will Not this increase that suspicion."

"Yes, it would," Ronnie said.  "And I think that is good.  They will not know if I have a special relationship with the captain, which I do, or if I have been singled out for special interrogation or even a special mission which is also true.  I don't know if you noticed, Star did not ask me any questions.  Private interrogation can be the explanation, especially if there is noise to that affect during the night."

Grudgingly, Gyllian said, "that's not a bad idea.  We also need to figure out what's next."

Ronnie yawned.  "You can start on that.  I need some sleep."

Gyllian was annoyed.  They needed Ronnie's input to make a plan.

"Don't be too annoyed," The Czarina said to Gyllian.  "She's tired and it has certainly been stressful to discover you have been surrounded by Pantheran agents."

"I suppose," Gyllian allowed.  "I do need her input as to how to proceed."

"Let's see what we can figure out on our own," Captain Kidd suggested.  "Ronnie will be our reality check."

"That's an excellent idea, William," The Czarina said.  "The girl is so thin.  I don't think she has been eating too well either."

"And being called a brown cow does not improve your sense of well-being and worth either," Christabel put in.  The AI was always quick to support women since her name sake had been an early feminist.

It looks like I've lost this round to Ronnie, Gyllian thought sourly, and she's not even here.  At least she probably will not know.  Yet again Gyllian wondered why she even cared.  Why did this woman rankle her so much.  Perhaps it was her lack of ambition and parochialism.  That flew in the face of Gillian's long-held desire to progress in her career and her wander lust to visit new places and have new experiences.  Perhaps that was behind her long running affair with Captain Star Runner.  It was a different experience.  Sure other humans engaged in cross alien relationships, but being involved with a Pantheran, even a renegade ungendered one, pushed the envelope of acceptability especially since an AI was also involved.  It also irritated Gyllian that Star was so smitten with the woman.  Her dark hair was stringy and she always looked like she needed a hair cut.  She had a rangy body and she moved without grace.  Her hands seemed to large for the rest of her body.  Gyllian could not recall, but she supposed Ronnie had big feet, too.  She had looked better when she was with Tana Lee O'Rourke, but then Tana Lee was a very hot item.  Gyllian preferred men, but Tana Lee could persuade her other side Gyllian was certain.

Why, Gyllian wondered, was she going off on such a mental tangent.  She had Oscar, dull, predictable, sweet Oscar.  Well, there was the problem.  Oscar was an anecdote to all the adventure in her line of work.  He never complained about her long absences.  He never asked what she was doing if she said it was work-related.  She stayed with Oscar to rest.  Was that fair to Oscar?  Probably not.  Were any of the people she was just thinking about suitable replacements for Oscar?  Absolutely not though she did suspect Tana Lee would leave the Alexandria Space Station if another opportunity presented itself.

Oh, stop it, Gyllian told herself.  Focus on the mission.  Pantheran agents in Capital City keeping an eye on Ronnie did not bode well.  And why had The Rebel Horde man, Teddy, gotten involved?  Was there a connection?

"Let's think about Teddy for a minute," Gyllian said to The Czarina and Captain Kidd. "Is this coincidence or does he have an agenda that dove tails with the Pantheran agents?"

"Could it be that the Pantherans are using The Rebel Horde to cause trouble for the established monarchies?" The Czarina asked.

She is smarter than she pretends to be, Gyllian thought.  Aloud she said, "That would be a way into the hearts and minds of a certain group of people on the Three Planets.  Promise them military aid to support their cause.  Lull them into thinking the Pantherans are the good guys and then, when the long-established governments are either busy or weakened, move in.  The Rebel Horde could be easily dealt with in a mop up operation."
"Sounds reasonable," Captain Kidd said.  "Do we have anything to cooperate this?"

"We do," Christabel said.  "Teddy's device has a lot of traffic between different cells.  Based on an analysis of the dialects used, the word they are using for their backers could refer to The Race.  It could also be a word I do not have in my database."

"So there's a possible link," Gyllian said thoughtfully.  "But Teddy has not made the connection between himself and the crowd at 202 Green Street."

"That does seem to be the case," Christabel said.

"That crowd might relate directly to Ronnie which is worrisome," The Czarina said.

"We need to protect Ronnie at all cost," Christabel said.

Gyllian said, "She is one of many factors here and the star system as a whole is my concern.  One person cannot stand in the way of a system wide plan."

"Captain Star Runner will not approve such a plan," Christabel said.

The Czarina and Captain Kidd nodded.  Gyllian sigh inwardly.  She had to work with these people and, more important, she had to be an honest broker.  If she deceived them once, they would not work with her again.  They will hold me accountable for Ronnie's safety, too, she thought.  I need to change my approach.  Ronnie needs to be my priority, too.

Aloud Gyllian said, "Clearly, our plans need to include protecting Ronnie."

The Czarina and Captain Kidd relaxed.  Captain Kidd poured more coffee.

knew how their technology worked, their devices could be returned to them with spy ware on them.  She floated this idea.

"That is possible," Christabel said.  "What do you want to know."
"Before that," Captain Kidd interjected, "is there a satellite or anything to beam these signals up to a ship or to the rest of the planet or even to another planet?  How are they communicating long distances?"

Gyllian thought, an obvious question.  I should have thought of that.  Satellites are such an antiquated technology it never crossed my mind.

"There are several satellites," Christabel reported.  "Shall I investigate?"

"Please do," Gyllian said.

Never show you have been taken by surprise Gyllian told herself.  Act as if you knew this all along.

"Where is Captain Star Runner?" The Czarina asked no one in particular.

"Asleep at last," Christabel said.  "He is in a deep sleep cycle right now.  I have been worried.  Star has been on edge since Star learned Ronnie was not doing well and possibly in danger in Capital City.  With her aboard, things will be much calmer."

But I need her in Capital City, Gyllian thought.  She can put a number of things in motion.  I do not know what those things are yet, but when I do, Ronnie will need to be the one doing it.  That will put her at risk by definition, but I do not see an alternative.  I will probably have to fight Star on this one.


Gyllian drank her now quite warm coffee as a delaying tactic.  She had to think.  The everyday people of Marathon lived with a technology which by any standard was archaic.  The governments seemed to have a more advanced technology but nothing like the rest of humanity in urban areas.  Assuming none of the direct participants really understood any of this technology, what could she do?  With Christabel aboard Gyllian had access to the most sophisticated software in the western spiral galactic arm.  She wish Josh was here to work with Christabel, but there seemed no way to make that happen.  Star would be willing to make the run to the Pharaoh Star System, but he would have no interest whatsoever in making a return run.

"One satellite is definitely Pantheran," Christabel said.  She always used the Pantheran word for themselves, spoken in a low register which always seemed to vibrate the air.  This was not the way Captain Star Runner spoke the name.  As an ungendered Pantheran, Star's voice was higher and much like a juvenile gendered Pantheran.  The lower register speech was preferred by members of the Race.  Star's high voice marked Star as ungendered and therefore inferior.

"And the other two?" Captain Kidd asked immediately.

"These are very old technology.  The satellites are in decaying orbits.  They transfer messages between the different provinces and to the other planets."

A spark of a plan was coming to Gyllian.  To maintain their communications, the Three Planet Alliance needed technological help.  Their human allies could provide that help while leaving them alone to live as they preferred.  It was an offer.  Meanwhile, Gyllian needed to know what they were using the satellites for.  She had no qualms about reading those messages.  Would Christabel?  Would Star if Christabel would not do it on her own?  One way to find out?

"Christabel, what sort of communication is being transferred?" Gyllian asked.

"Unknown," Christabel responded immediately.

"Find out, will you?"  Gyllian tried to speak as casually as possible to indicate to Christabel her interest in the messages was not that important.

"I will need Captain Star Runner's approval for that," Christabel responded.  Her tone was crisp and, Gyllian thought, dismissive.  Christabel had understood what she wanted.  That was unfortunate.  She was losing time.  Christabel would not wake Star and if Gyllian went to do so herself, Christabel would block her.  It was better to stay on the AI's good side.  She would be a serious enemy and she would definitely influence Star as well.

"How about the Pantheran satellite," Gyllian said instead.

"I have been looking into that," Gyllian said.  "The encryption is of a lower level.  They did not expect any hackers."

"That is sloppy," Captain Kidd put in.  "The League of Hypatian Pirates can crack low level Pantheran security."

And all this while, Gyllian thought, I have two Pantheran military squadrons on the loose.  One could show up here any moment.  They might be able to tell their systems were hacked.

"I will need to work slowly," Christabel said as if she could read Gillian's mind.  "I know you want this information immediately, Gyllian, but I do not want the Pantheran military to get any whiff of an intrusion...  I have the hacking routines, but I am not experienced hacker."

All the humans sitting around the table smiled.  Christabel's protestations to the contrary, Captain Star Runner was a known hacker and a fairly reputable one.  Obviously, they worked together.  If Star was awake, there would be intuition at play.  With Christabel solely on the job, the hacking would proceed in an orderly manner as well as covering her tracks.  As the Fungusians had greatly augmented the star runner artificial intelligence package, it was doubtful a standard star runner aboard a military vehicle or any other AI package aboard their ships would detect Christabel's activity.  After all, this satellite was not state of the art.  This was one that was old and not needed anywhere else.

-----
A real question I am going to have to figure out is why Captain Star Runner has an area in the cargo section of its ride which essentially has cells and a recreational area.  Is it possible that Star was given a military ship by the People of the Rainbow Way and this is the brig?  If so, it would go a long way to explaining things.  The back door to Ronnie's cell is a little harder to explain but it may be a way to get a prisoner into the rest of the ship without going through the recreational area.  Another possibility is that this area is for a lesser status crew or travelers.  The outside locks and security cameras could have been a quick add by Christabel or just part of the set up.  If this scenario is the case, the door upstairs makes more sense.  It could also be used by an officer charged with overseeing these people.

*  Chapter Nine:  The Return to Capital City!
**  Section Thirty-Two:  Meeting with Lord Stern

Ronnie did not like the plan.  Captain Star Runner did not like the plan.  The Czarina and Captain Kidd were not encouraging about the plan.  Gyllian did not ask Christabel what she thought of the plan.  She suspected Christabel would side with Captain Star Runner.  To tell the truth, Gyllian was not wild about the plan either, but no better plan had emerged.  The four companions would be released by the Afternoon of the Faun River so they could easily make their way home.  Gyllian would meet Ronnie in Lord Stern's office.

When Captain Star Runner presented this plan to the four companions, Hollis cried out, "I cannot go back.  She wants to kill me.  Please let me stay."

No one was prepared for this response.  Ronnie thought Hollis would be tired of being away from his comfortable life and by now Lord Stern would have found a way for Hollin to refrain from poisoning him.

Quick thinking because she was an AI, Christabel told Star to ask, "Are you seeking asylum aboard this ride?"

"Please let me stay," Hollis repeated.  "I will not be any trouble.  I'll just stay down here and not bother you."

By then Gyllian was able to say, "Tell him he can stay for a few days, no more."

Shielding Hollis from the other human beings on board would become increasingly difficult.  No one thought complete isolation would be beneficial to the boy who was used to other people doing his bidding and taking care of him.

Star granted temporary asylum.  Gwennore wanted to stay, too, but Star insisted she return to her observing.  Star praised her for her work thus far.  This delighted Gwennore.  The Czarina had proposed giving Gwennore a pin to wear and had designed one.  Star gave it to her and Gwennore proudly affixed it to her jump suit.  Star also presented her with a stylized picture of a Pantheran.  Ronnie recognized it as based on a famous Pantheran statue which appeared on many video clips and as a common image depicting The Race.

Teddy smirked at them all.  Ronnie watched him carefully.  She was anxious that he meant her harm.  In Gillian's opinion, Teddy did not see Ronnie as a threat nor did he have much investment in her except as a cover for his own actions.

Ronnie and Gyllian agreed on the time where they should meet to see Lord Stern.

The meeting did not go well.  Lord Stern objected to every proposal either woman presented.  He did not believe Teddy was a member of The Rebel Horde.  He did not believe the residents at 202 Green Street excepting Ronnie were agents of the Pantheran Empire.  He did not want Hollis to stay aboard Gillian's spaceship while things were sorted out with his sister.  He assured Gyllian that the Three Planets Alliance was secure and no Pantheran incursion was imminent.  Ronnie began to wonder if Lord Stern was a Pantheran agent but she saw no way to communicate that to Gyllian while they were at the meeting.  Finally, Lord Stern insisted Ronnie discover who they should arrest for the murder of the swan, Gyllian lost her patience.

She said, "Ms. Camberwell is a trusted member of my team.  She would never, never hurt an animal.  She never saw a swan until she came to Marathon.  I think you should look closer to home, Lord Stern.  We have identified a member of The Rebel Horde who has the motive, the means and the opportunity to kill the swan, implicate Ms. Camberwell with the item I gave you and put the message there.  In fact, i am sure he is the one who you sent to place Ms. Camberwell's case there. You said you were interested in establishing a relationship with the rest of humanity here in the western galactic arm.  I see no evidence of that willingness.  I think the organization I represent needs to look elsewhere.  As for Prince Hollis--"

Here Ronnie interrupted before Gyllian could release Hollis to his fate.  "Hollis has asked for asylum.  We will review his request in the next few days to determine its validity and to confirm it is what he wants to do."

Gyllian did not hesitate.

"That is our procedure," she confirmed.  "He may lose his royal status with us, but he is young and has great opportunities before him."

"Prince Hollis is needed here," Lord Stern insisted.

"So that he can be a pawn in his sister's sick schemes?" Ronnie asked.  "This is not a fairy tale where the evil queen gets to do things to our hero so he can prove himself.  Hollis is young and vulnerable."

"Which is why he should not be aboard your ship," Lord Stern shot back.

"We have him isolated from the rest of the crew," Gyllian assured him.  "He has seen the Pantheran, of course, but not the other humans and me."

"His supposed death is a fake," Lord Stern said, trying to get hold of his emotions.   

"Does he know this?  I don't think so," Gyllian said.

Lord Stern sighed.  "It is how it is done.  The young prince 'dies" to the public.  This allows him to remove himself from the public eye and learn how to govern.  Hollin to take over  all public activities in her own right and concentrate on public relations.  Hollis will work in the background.  I did that before him.  When he is ready, he will take over from me.  Unfortunately, my sister died in a boating accident and that meant we had to rush Hollin into the role.  She doesn't completely understand it yet and is making some colossal mistakes.  I need the flexibility to work this through."  Again Lord Stern sighed.

"Then we have a perfect opportunity to educate Hollis," Gyllian said, not missing a beat."

Lord Stern dismissed her suggestion with a wave of his hand.  "moving forward is generally a good idea, but we have thousands of years of tradition.  It will not change on my watch."  But, of course, it did.
**  Section Thirty-Three:  The Rebel Horde Takes Action

The explosions started soon after our meeting with Lord Stern.  They started on the eastern coast of the continent and worked their way west.  The Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer is on the west coast.  It took only a few hours for anything to happen here.  The Royal Province of Barbara of Portugal sustained the worst damage.  What surprised us all was how much damage was done to the area I had thought was the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  From what Teddy had hinted, I thought perhaps this was the home of The Rebel Horde, but Captain Star Runner, who was monitoring all the communications traffic, said this was not true.  We speculated that The Rebel Horde wanted to trigger either an earthquake or a volcanic eruption or even a tsunami.  Nothing of the kind occurred.  The Royal Province of Barbara of Portugal fell.  The Royal Province of Telemann went offline and it was months before anyone knew for sure what had happened.  The Duchy of Scarlatti became the central contact point for The Rebel Horde.  It is to the northeast of the Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer.  This meant Lord Stern mobilized to contain them so that their activities would not spill over the border and affect valuable agricultural areas.

The explosions change everything.  Gyllian intended to return to the ride after our meeting, but when the explosions started, Captain Star Runner blasted off into space.  Although we were in direct communication with her and Christabel and the others, Star was unwilling to set the ride back down on the ground..  Gyllian and I returned to my room at 202 Green Street.  We would have to do together what I was supposed to do on my own.  Although I consider myself a fairly brave person, I was thankful Gyllian took over my role.  I maintained a lookout while she went up the stairs to Daniel s's attic room.  To my horror, Daniels returned and I engaged him in a brief conversation to at least let Gyllian know he was coming.  After he left me, I stepped inside my room, but listened at the door.  I heard Daniels moving about but nothing else.

I wondered how Gyllian managed to hide and how long she would have to stay hidden.  There was a tap at my window.  I turned around to see Gyllian crouching on my fire escape.  I quickly moved to the window and let her in.  Fortunately, she had worn her coat but she was quite cold.  As usual, the fire on the hearth was very weak and I had not replenished the coal to make a hotter fire.  Gyllian gestured that I should fetch my coat.

We crept down the stairs and out onto the street.  I decided it would be dangerous to frequent the Green Street Tea Room.  Gyllian had already removed some bugs from my room.  Instead we took an omnibus to a better section of town.  Gyllian and I stopped at a shop and I bought a better coat.  Gyllian was for throwing my old one into a rubbish container, but I found a charity shop and left it there.  There was still some wear in it and it would keep another poor soul warm for the rest of the winter.  Not much conversation passed between us until we found a noisy eatery where we gratefully ordered hot food and drink.  We could finally talk in our corner booth.

"How did you get out?" I asked.

Gyllian replied, "Through the window.  It is set up as an escape route.  I don't think he'll know I was up there."

"And from the window you went--" I prompted.

"Onto the roof.  Then I went to the neighbor's roof which is a bit lower and from there to one fire escape after another.  I was really glad there is one outside your window."

I shivered.  "Scary," I said.

"I was worried about ice," Gyllian confided.  "Fortunately, I did not run into any."

"Did you have time to see anything?"

"Lots.  No wonder you found him creepy.  There's a lot of  of pornography scattered about.  Not just pornography but torture as well.  I wouldn't be surprised to find snuff there as well."

Again I shivered.  Daniels was a nasty piece of work.

"And I saw communications equipment," Gyllian went on.  "Some of it appears to be local.  I think he is tapping into the local communications network.  That means he is listening in on all royal traffic internally and between the provinces.  I also saw Pantheran technology.  It is very old technology like the device Gwennore had."

"So we have a link between Pantheran technology and local communications," I said.

"You have it in one," Gyllian agreed.  "I think Daniels is a smuggler, too.  There's lots of stuff all over that attic.  If Gwennore and the landlady Farnesworth are both involved, there must be goods stashed everywhere."

"We could report it," I said hesitantly, "but in the current emergency, I doubt anyone would pay any mind."

"A smugglers dream come true," Gyllian said, finishing off her tea and pouring another cup from the pot between us.

"the part I cannot figure out," Ronnie said, "is how the Pantherans contacted these people."

"I've been thinking about that, too," Gyllian said.  "I think I have been working under a false assumption."

Ronnie looked interested.  Gyllian rarely made mistakes.  She even more rarely admitted them.

"Here's what I think," Gyllian said.  "i thought our coming here tipped the Pantherans off.  That is why I have been watching their military movements--well, I'd be watching them anyway--but I've been worried that they followed us here and it was my investigation of The Big Dig that alerted the Empire to these three human settled planets.  Now I'm wondering if that is true at all."

"Say more," I said to encourage this exposition.

"Suppose the Pantherans have known for some time that these settled planets existed.  Suppose their incursion into the Pharaoh Star System wasn't to learn where the people from The Big Dig had gone, but to keep us from finding them.  The locked insertion point was to keep us out.  They knew all along how to get here.  When we got through, they acted as if they did not know how to get here.  Maybe they've been here for some time, watching.  The technology is old because they've been watching for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years."

"Do you think they would wait so long to do anything?" I asked.

"The Pantheran Empire has been around for tens of thousands of years," Gyllian said.  "What's a few thousand to a race that believes it will always be dominant.  The Pantherans cannot conceive anyone will ever defeat them.  Oh," she put up a hand to keep me from interrupting, "I suspect there are a few gendered Pantherans who have a better understanding of the rise and fall of civilizations, but the rank-and-file Pantherans, mostly of which are ungendered, believe in Pantheran hegemony forever.  Star does.  Star is a prime example of their educational system I am sure."

"So what are the Pantherans doing here?"

"Causing instability," Gyllian replied.  "They are keeping The Three Planet Alliance backward.  They can still travel between their planets, but they cannot leave the area.  They cannot contact the rest of humanity.  They stay frozen in time more or less.  One way or another they'll recover from this most recent upheaval.  Maybe the provinces will abandon royal rule or maybe they'll reinstate it.  Maybe they will join together under one leader or maybe there will be a descent into a more chaotic period, but they will not become a space faring entity to change the balance of power anywhere.  The smaller space faring races will not have any interest in combining with them to challenge the more established space faring groups like the Fungusian Network or the Featherote Charm or the Alliance of Planets. Queens land isn't interested in them nor would the Republic of Space pay them any mind.  The Seven Sacred Worlds isn't sending out any evangelists at the moment either."

It sounded convincing but it wasn't what we had said earlier so I said, "I thought we thought the Pantherans were set on total annihilation."

"That fit the facts at the time," Gyllian said.  She could certainly shift her position and be convincing.  "Seeing all that gear in Daniels' room leads me to think otherwise.  It's diabolical.  Eventually their space faring ability will wither.  They will run out of resources to fabricate anything electronic and they will revert to an agrarian society which will be subject to plagues, famines and wars.  In short, they will become less human and it is all because they left what we call the Coalition.  If I'm right," and here she leaned across the table, "we all have greatly underestimated the Pantheran mind set.  We're used to dealing with the ungendered.  The ungendered who are engineered to be politicians and diplomats are excellent.  They play their cards close to the vest.  They wield and deal marvelously.  I have also dealt with their military intelligence.  They are bright, devious, and all of them are very shrewd.  Their traders drive a hard bargain,.  Their star runners are the best pilots any race knows.  But we don't know the rulers, the big decision-makers.  We never see them.  We would hardly know they exist except for propaganda fed to the Race as a whole.  What I think I now know is they play a very long game.  It is something I need to take back to the Alliance and the Solar League.  We need to do some hard thinking and a lot of research.  There is a mind at work here which is prepared to watch and wait.  Christabel may be able to learn something from the satellite which can change my mind or confirm my suspicions.  We'll just have to see."

I thought about my lovable Captain Star Runner and what Gyllian had said.  Star thought herself clever, but basically she was an open book, able to be easily deceived and at times manipulated, especially by people like Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo.  That said, it would be a major mistake to expect all Pantherans were like Star.  After all, Star had done something no other ungendered Pantheran had done, at least that we knew of.  Star had revolted against termination and gone out on her own.  No other ungendered Pantheran had successfully done such a thing as far as anyone else knew of.  Perhaps it was being a fuchsia-colored Pantheran that had made this possible.  Perhaps Star had a more influential role to play in the history of the Pantheran Empire.  Perhaps, as Star often said, the rarity of fuchsia-colored members of The Race simply invited myth making.

My thought process was interrupted by a crowd gathering around a patterer.  Patrons in the eatery were leaving their tables to hear the news.  It must be important.  I rose from my chair.

"What's going on?" Gyllian asked.

"There is news," I said.  "Come and we'll hear."

We left the restaurant and joined the crowd.

"What is this?" Gyllian asked.

"Most people in Capital City cannot read a newspaper.  There is no video or audio communications so individuals retell the news.  They are called patterers and they make news telling an art form.  People toss them coins if their performance is worthy or the news is important.  Basically, they work for tips."

We could not see the patterer but we could hear her.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Disaster. Disaster.
Weep and wail.
Lord Stern killed by the sword.
Valiant.
Courageous.
A credit to our queen.
#!END_QUOTE
The patterer's tribute to the now deceased Lord Stern was interrupted by a mighty explosion.  People in the crowd cried out.  There was pushing and shoving.  People went down.  Some were trampled.

"It's the Royal precincts," people were shouting.  "The Royal Precincts have been hit.  The Royal Precincts have been destroyed."

Gyllian grabbed my arm.

She said, "Come with me.  Hurry."

We ran.  Most people ran away from the river.  Most people put as much distance between themselves and the fire which raged where the great edifice which was the Royal Precincts now burned.  Large sections of the great stone work had fallen away.  Some of it fell into the Afternoon of the Faun River.  Other parts fell back inside the Royal Precincts.  I wondered how many people were either dead or trapped beneath those mighty stones.

"I hope one of the bridges is still in tact," Gyllian panted.

"Come this way," I said, taking control of the direction of our run.  The bridge further up the river may still be there.  Besides, there may be a boat we can snag.

I was right.  One of the bridges near the more expensive neighborhoods was still standing.  People were rushing to and fro but we fought our way across.

"Which way to the Royal Gardens?" Gyllian asked, still breathless.

I pointed.

When we dashed through the gates, Gyllian stopped to signal the ship.

"We have to get out of here," Gyllian told either Star or Christabel.  "The city will be in chaos soon.  We'll try to find Hollin.  I think I know where she is.  I will not be able to look for her inside the Royal Precincts.  Hurry."

Then Gyllian set off at a run toward the lake and the island where I found the dead swan.

Miraculously, the foot bridge to the island was still in tact.  Gyllian, no longer running, but walking fast, circled the island and came to another foot bridge.  We crossed it and found ourselves in a woods.  

"Where are we going?" I managed to ask, gasping for breath.

"To the bower," Gyllian said.  "I met Lord Stern there once.  It is here somewhere.  He said it was a favorite haunt of the queen."

We made a few wrong turns and had to backtrack twice, but we found the cottage.  As Gyllian predicted, Hollin was there.  She was curled up in a corner, weeping.

"Help me," Gyllian said and reached for one of her arms.

Together we got Hollin on her feet.

"It's all hopeless," Hollin sobbed.  "Lord Stern is dead.  Hollis has run away.  I don't know what to do and now the Royal Precincts are destroyed."

"We're taking you to your brother," Gyllian said.  "Hurry.  You'll be safe with him."

Unquestioningly, Hollin went with us.  Star put the ship down.  Fortunately she had kept the ride in geosynchronous orbit and could come for us quickly.

We ran up the ramp and before we could settle ourselves, Star was blasting off.
*  Chapter Ten:  The Pantheran Threat
**  Section Thirty-Three:  Now What?
Hollis and Hollin embraced when they saw each other.  Hollin had much to tell Hollis and Hollis shared being aboard the ship with Hollis.  It was fortunate, Gyllian thought, that The Czarina took it upon herself to speak with the children--Gyllian thought of them as children--and help them through the first days of their grief and relocation.

Christabel continued to monitor the disintegration of Marathon.  According to the reports that came in, The Rebel Horde had lost control of their insurgency.  People just exploded things.  Sometimes they belonged to a group with an agenda.  Sometimes,, it seemed, groups of individuals blew up things for the sake of blowing them up.  There were food riots.  There were natural disasters like flooding or blizzards.  The only place there seemed to be any organization at all was in the former Duchy of Scarlatti now called Freedom.  The Rebel Horde had no real agenda and they found themselves calling on the former government employees to return to work to manage the province.  Some did.  Some did not.  Many had already been killed and could not assist them.  Debussy on La Mer fell into total chaos and many died.  Mobs went on rampages.  Without a municipal leadership, a group headed by Daniels took over.  It seemed he was only interested in personal gain and those who could assist him in obtaining it.  There was no word on either Mrs. Farnesworth or Gwennore.  Ronnie suspected Daniels had eliminated them if they had not succumbed in the mob violence which preceded his administration.

Meanwhile, those aboard the ship excepting Hollis and Hollin, discussed what their next move was.

Gyllian said, "The Confederation is ineffectual.  I've contacted them but basically they only have representatives from the other two planets.  So long as this rebellion stays focused on Marathon, they don't really care what happens.  The manufacturing centers for their higher end technologies are on Safe Landing so collectively they aren't too worried.  I think they are short-sighted, of course.  Most of the population is located on Marathon.  Without workers and knowledgeable ones at that, they will run into trouble later."

"What makes them so isolationist?" Ronnie asked.  With a look in Captain Kidd's direction she said, "The League of Hypatian Pirates thinks of itself as operating independently, but it knows it depends on the structure of the Pharaoh Star System to support its activities.  It needs the Over the Moon Base to transfer cargo and repair its ships.  It needs the Asclepius Medical Center to care for its injured and sick.  It needs Ptolemy City to employ them.  Yes, once upon a time, it could operate at the Third Cataract and a very scaled down version of the Over the Moon with rough-and-ready medical care, but that was in the distant past."
Gyllian said, "I think they have lost the ability to think in terms of a galactic perspective.  I think they would be classified as a retrograde society."

The Czarina joined them.  "From our experience on Llondune, I would agree with that assessment, wouldn't you, dear?" she turned to Captain Kidd.

"Yes, I think I would," Captain Kidd said.  "They say us pirates don't give a damn about anybody else, but we care about our star system and our race much more than these people do.  We don't pray upon a fleet of ships carrying medical supplies or food to a disaster area, at least, reputable pirates don't.  We take care of those who do something like that.  These people," he shook his head in wonder, "these people are indifferent to the suffering of others.  They have no interest in bettering themselves or getting ahead."

"How are Hollis and Hollin?" Ronnie asked The Czarina.

"Asleep," The Czarina said.  "Are we planning to integrate them into our group."

"I have been thinking about that," Gyllian said.  "They aren't our equals, of course.  It is their planet but they don't have any say in our mission.  I think isolating them would be inadvisable.  What do you think, Star?  It your ship."

Captain Star Runner remained in the control area.  He claimed pressing work.  Gyllian wondered if there was something wrong or whether he was avoiding the humans on board.

"I am pleased you have remembered that this is my ride," Captain Star Runner said over the intercom.  "Perhaps you should have thought of that before inviting Queen Hollin on board.  She will be quite difficult.  I find her tone of voice and her manner very unsettling and unpleasant."

What Christabel heard and saw Captain Star Runner also heard and saw if he received the stream unfiltered.

Gyllian said, "She was my only link to the planet.  I had to take her on board."

Star made a noise that had no speech equivalent.  It sounded like a snort.

Fence repairing time, Gyllian thought.  She would have to look for an opportunity.

"We have an update on the Pantheran satellite," Christabel said.

"We're listening," Gyllian said.

"When I showed the data to Captain Star Runner, it said it looked familiar and might be in the juvenile archives.  I have not had a reason to decompress them so it did not look familiar to me.  Captain Star Runner is right.  The code was used in juvenile classes.  It is a very old code.  Armed with this information, we were able to easily decode everything and read it.  We've reset all the flags so the data remains in an unread and UN-interrogated state."

"The latest messages that have come in are from someone called Dangerous Daniels," Christabel continued.  "We believe this is the Daniels from 202 Green Street.  He is advising the Pantherans that he has completed the mission and wants the rest of the payment."

"What mission?" Gyllian asked quickly.  "What sort of payment?"

"I am getting to that," Christabel said with a touch of exasperation in her tone.  "I need to explain everything to you so you understand the scope of this message."

"Please continue," Gyllian said.  Sometimes the AI could be very pedantic.

"The messages stored in the satellite go back one hundred and thirty-seven Pantheran years plus forty-seven days.  This is represented as a hexadecimal number.  By reading all the messages, we have learned this arrangement was established with someone called Dangerous Daniels but the current Dangerous Daniels is not the one who made the original bargain.  The contract is not stored on the satellite so we have no idea what the payment is or how it is to be paid.  Intelligence information is given about various governments, the people involved and different treaties and trade agreements made.  Now the message states that the de-stabilization that the Pantherans required has been achieved."

 
"And that works out to be how many solar years?" Ronnie asked.

"About two hundred and fifty," Christabel said immediately.

"So this organization or this group of people have been working on a contract for the Pantherans for several centuries?" The Czarina asked.  "That's incredible."

"It must be a hell of a pay off," Captain Kidd said.  "I am trying to imagine the League of Hypatian Pirates passing down a contract like that."

"It must assure them world domination or something," Ronnie said.

"There must have been a down payment and then the rest to follow," Gyllian said, trying to work out what the end game here was.  "As Ronnie says, they were promised world denomination or immortality or a chance to work on a bigger stage.  I cannot imagine the Pantherans offering them anything like that."

"You could keep stringing them along," Captain Kidd mused.  A"Promise them something vague but big.  Give them something, then keep coming back and giving them a little more and then a little more while moving the goal further and further out."

"So when are the Pantherans expected back to pick up their messages?" The Czarina asked.

"Soon," Christabel said.

"Do we want to be here when they do?" Ronnie asked.

Before anyone could answer, Captain Star Runner said, "They're here."

**  Section Thirty-Four:  Take One Mother Space

This is one possible ending.  I do not like this possible ending very much as it closes off the Confederation of Three Planets and leaves Hollis and Hollin the only survivors.  In this scenario, Hollin kills herself leaving Hollis alone.  Star suggests Hollis join Tamara's archaeological dig.  It is a downer.  I will keep this ending here as part of nanowrimo but I will rewrite this section with a different outcome.

"Let's move," Gyllian said.  Her tone was one of command.

"Already done," Captain Star Runner said.  "It is a whole squadron of military vehicles.  I do not want to be anywhere near them."

"Can we get to an extraction point before they notice us?" Gyllian asked.

"We are shielded from them by the planet and one of its moons," Star replied.  "I have kept us hidden since your return.  I can move directly toward a safe extraction point.  Please secure yourselves for high G acceleration."

Star wanted to move quickly.

"William and I will secure the children," The Czarina said.  "We are old hands at acceleration."

They moved quickly to reach the crew quarters where Hollis and Hollin were.

Gyllian walked toward her cabin.  She disliked acceleration in Star's vessel whatever the vessel. Captain Star Runner always went as fast as human beings could tolerate and it was never comfortable.  Gyllian hoped Hollis and Hollin would not be too frightened.  At times, she was frightened at the amount of G-force her body was expected to tolerate.

Later, it seemed like an eternity, the G-forces dissipated.

"We are in Mother Space," Christabel announced.  "We have also heard some military chatter to pass on to you."  Christabel paused.  That was unusual.  The AI had a sense of drama, but usually she gave the information quickly.  "The Pantherans are seeding the star.  It will go supernova within seven solar days."

would be destroyed within the week and there would be nothing she could do about it.  All her efforts had been a total waste of time.  The Pantherans had never wanted the worlds to survive.

Idly, Gyllian wondered if Christabel meant seven standard solar days or seven local standard days.  She supposed it really did not matter.  The planets settled by the escaping humans all those thousands of years ago.

"If that is true," Ronnie said later, "then why all this cloak and dagger stuff about a contract with Dangerous Daniels and company?  It makes no sense."

"It is a test," Captain Star Runner said.  "This is a new weapon and it needs a test star."

"Do what we say or we'll blow your planet up," Gyllian said.  "Want proof?  We can show you our test star."

They sat in silence, still shocked by the overwhelming destruction and disregard for life, even life in a chaotic world.

"Now what?" The Czarina asked.  "I keep saying this over and over.  I don't like saying it, but it seems the only question to ask."

**  Section Thirty-Four:  Take Two.  Mother Space
As soon as Gyllian and Ronnie had frog marched Hollin on board the ship, Gyllian said, "Let's move."  This was her command voice.

"Already preparing for blast off," Captain Star Runner replied.

"What is our status?" Gyllian asked when she had shed her winter clothes.

The Czarina stepped forward to shepherd Hollin below to join her brother.  There seemed no reason to pretend there were no human beings aboard any more.  With the destruction of The Royal Precincts and the death of Lord Stern, the government of The Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer had effectively fallen to The Rebel Horde.  Gyllian never learn what The Czarina said in explanation.  Perhaps she said nothing at all but acted as if her appearance in their lives was to be expected.  The Czarina was a woman of mystery and she rarely explained anything.  Gyllian was surprised at her maternal nature.  She was surprised, too, that Captain Kidd joined her in caring for the two former royals.  Gyllian had to remind herself that neither Hollis nor Hollin were children though their behavior was often juvenile.  She had had several years experience in the Solar League Navy at their age and had already been under fire.

"We are holding our position behind the larger Marathon moon," Captain Star Runner reported.

"Because--" Gyllian said.

"Because of Christabel's calculations and an updated Fungusian Network communique," Captain Star Runner replied.

My.  He was being formal.  Gyllian recognized Captain Star Runner's lapse into military protocols.  Was this stress or was there a reason for the fuchsia-colored Pantherans behavior?

"Report," she said.

Christabel said, "I have read all the reports housed on the Pantheran satellite.  They date back two hundred and fifty Pantheran solar years.  This suggests the Pantherans do not come very often to pick up their messages.  However, the most recent message has just arrived from Dangerous Daniels.  This is a name used throughout the two hundred and fifty year period.  It is more of a title than a name."

Gyllian waited.  Interrupting Christabel could simply mean waiting longer for the critical information.

"Dangerous Daniels states he has fulfilled the contract set for Dangerous Daniels and his organization.  He asks for the balance 
due on the contract in precious metals."

"So The Rebel Horde is behind all the chaos," Ronnie said.

"It would appear so," Christabel said.  "The Rebel Horde must have been a large organization."

"Do we know if anything like this is happening on the other planets?" Gyllian asked.

"There is minimal traffic incoming to the satellite which handles interplanetary communications," Christabel said.  "Should I read it?"

"Immediately," Gyllian said.  "I want to know what the Confederation Council is doing."

Shortly Christabel spoke.

"The Confederation Council offices were located in the Royal Province of Barbara of Portugal.  The entire city of New and Improved Lisbon has been destroyed.  This suggests that the Confederation Council has ceased to exist.  It sent out no recent messages.  The messages which are coming from the other two planets report the same general destruction as we are seeing on Marathon."

"A very well-coordinated attack," Gyllian murmured.

"Perhaps it has taken all this time to put such a plan in place," Ronnie suggested.  "It's a very, very long time, but maybe it took that long to set up such a complicated plan and pass information on to the following generation."

"Are you serious?" Gyllian asked.

"Yes, I am." Ronnie was sure of her reasoning.  "This is a civilization which figured out how to flee from the War of the Second Expansion.  It coordinated moving people from one planet to a staging area on Hypatia and from there to this star system.  Planning must be one of their well phoned abilities.  If you think about it, the scenario Lord Stern laid out for us on how the royal children are raised and trained while maintaining the fiction of Queen Victoria and her husband points to careful planning.  I doubt any resident of the Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer believes the individual they see is the old queen Victoria, but they like the consistency.  There may have been economic and manufacturing constraints which needed to keep the majority of the population in such a technologically poor state, but they all agreed to do it by maintaining the fiction."

"You girls must be hungry," The Czarina said, coming into the lounge carrying two plates.  "Sit and eat.  I have given both Hollis and Hollin each a sedative.  Christabel will monitor them.  William is bringing coffee.  Not sit down and eat."

They did.  The Czarina went back for plates for herself and Captain Kidd.

"The Fungusian Network has advised the neither of the two squadrons previously discussed are heading our way," Captain Star Runner said.  "However, something is near one of the extraction points we previously mapped."

"Not the one inside the star system," Gyllian said quickly.

"No.  One of the outer ones."  A star map appeared on the lounge screen.  Captain Star Runner had highlighted the one in question.

"Can you be any more specific?" Gyllian asked.

"Only that it is there," Star said.  "It is at the edge of my perception.  My hunch is that it is a Pantheran military vehicle.  That presence would be familiar enough for me to sense it."
"Well, Colonel," Captain Kidd said, "do we wait for it or do we run?"

"Can we step into hyperspace without that ship knowing about us?" Gyllian asked.

"Cat and mouse we play then," Captain Kidd said before Captain Star runner could reply.

"I want to know what happens but I do not want to engage the Pantheran vessel," Gillian explained.  "This vessel is not armed with weapons to do any damage to a military vessel.  And besides, a military vessel could do a lot of damage to this one."

"Not so," Captain Star Runner said.  "This is a military vehicle.  The People of the Rainbow Way provided me with this ride when my own vehicle was destroyed.  It is not the most current model.  It does have weapons, but I am not well-schooled in how to use them nor would the People of the Rainbow Way be very pleased with me if I did.  It might allow the Empire to study them and learn more advanced weaponry.  Besides, I am not engineered to be a gunnery crew member."

"But can we evacuate without detection?" Gyllian asked.

"I am preparing to do just that," Star replied.  "You do need to prepare for acceleration, including the two guests in the cargo area."

The human beings went to work, securing Hollis and Hollin and then themselves.

"We do not have much time to evacuate," Captain Star Runner said.  "I will need to move quickly and in such a way to minimize our exposure to a vehicle coming through that particular extraction point.  Stand by for acceleration."

The run was hard.  Captain Star Runner knew the limitations of human physiology.  Christabel closely monitored everyone on board.  The individual toleration of Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell, Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo, Captain William Kidd and The Czarina was known to Captain Star Runner, but the two visitors, Hollis and Hollin, were unknown quantities.  The acceleration was steady, allowing time for Christabel to monitor everyone and report any indicators of stress.  Being young and sedated, Hollis and Hollin tolerated the stress well.  Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell was always very sensitive to the stress.  Being older, The Czarina and Captain William Kidd also were showing signs of stress.  Although she would not like Captain Star Runner to know this, Star was also noticing that Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo herself was aging.

Captain Star Runner push the ride's acceleration to the maximum allowed by the human beings on board.  Using the several planets and moons available to Star and the star itself, Star plotted a course to an insertion point out of the direct line of inquiry by the perceived other vehicle.  They inserted into Mother Space before there was any indication another vehicle had extracted into normal space.

"How long do we wait here?" Ronnie asked when they reassembled in the lounge.

"And what should I tell Hollis and Hollin?" The Czarina asked.  "Can I bring them up here?"

Gyllian considered her options.  It would all be a shock to them, but what alternative did she have?  The control center would have to be off limits to them.  Captain Star Runner had been keeping to himself.  He had been edgy this whole mission.  Undoubtedly it was the possibility of a Pantheran encounter that kept him tied to his acceleration platform.  Ronnie had visited him often.  Gyllian also did not want to invade their personal space.  A human stateroom was extremely small and both Ronnie and Captain Star Runner would have a difficult time having a comfortable private tet etet in the one Ronnie occupied.  This ship had not been adapted for a conjugal visit.

While they waited for something to happen in the star system, they all endured Hollin's histrionics.  She cried.  She screamed.  She threatened.  She pleaded with them to change her circumstances.  She blamed them for all the terrible things which had happened on her planet.  She accused them of fostering all the destruction.  She threatened them with execution.  She demanded that they show her the respect she deserved as a monarch.  In short, she behaved very badly yet very predictably.

Gyllian said, "We know this is very difficult for you, Hollin, but I expect a person of your background and upbringing would accept the things you cannot change and set about making a life for yourself.  Being aboard this ship will open up possibilities you have not even dreamed of."

Hollis was excited to be on board a spaceship in hyperspace and to learn that there were other human beings aboard.  Gyllian suspected his adjustment to his current reality would be easier superficially but might be more difficult over the long run.  Hollin was emotional and would let her feelings of loss and outrage show.
At last Captain Star Runner said, "The vehicle has left Mother Space."

"Do you know what it is doing?" Hollis asked.  He was breathless with excitement.

"I am preparing a probe to monitor the vehicle," Star replied.  "It will scan for the new vehicle and return with any particulars it can ascertain.  When I receive that information, I will be able to prepare a more precise probe that will be able to give me more specific information."

"Hollis, please do not ask Captain Star Runner any more questions at this time," The Czarina instructed.  "You can record your questions and ask the captain later.  Starship captains are very busy people.  They have to run the whole ship and right now, we are very concerned what this unknown vessel is doing near your star system."

One of the positive things which could be said about Hollis, Gyllian thought, was that he was quite capable of following directions.  He worked with the writing tools The Czarina provided and wrote many questions.  Hollin, on the other hand, was bored and fidgeted as conspicuously as possible.

"Perhaps you would like some entertainment," The Czarina said to her.  "Waiting for developments can be so tedious.  The cargo bay area you used earlier has a wide variety of entertainment possibilities.  Let me show you some of the ones that may interest you."

The Czarina said when she returned, "I showed her the vids dealing with current fashion in The Solar League.  There are hours and hours of video.  I am certain it will keep her occupied for some time."
Gyllian raised her eyebrows.

"In her position at court, I suspect knowing the latest fashion, especially the latest fashion from the Royal Province of Barbara of Portugal, was exceedingly important to her position," The Czarina said.  "She was thrilled to hear that fashion still matters."

Ronnie laughed out loud.  "Czarina, you are a classic, but I doubt either Gyllian or I would win any fashion contests.  Tara Lee thought I was quite hopeless."

Gyllian could not help smiling, both at Ronnie's candid admission at her total lack of fashion sense and at her own indifference to fashion trends.  Her dress uniform was her answer to those who insisted dressing in the latest designs was essential.
**  Section Thirty-Five:  The Pantheran Threat Comes to the Star System
"I am deploying the probe now," Captain Star Runner advised.

"Please show the real time images on the lounge screen," Gyllian said.

"I am unable to do that," Captain Star Runner replied.  "This probe is not military grade.  I only have plans to construct a monitoring probe."  Star Runner's tone was icy and accusative.

Did you really think I was going to give you military grade instructions for constructing a probe you may or may not have needed to deploy, Gyllian thought.  You would be selling them on the black market, hell, the open market, within a Featherote heartbeat.  I would certainly like to have an entire cluster of probes out there right now but I did not dare risk it.  For one thing, I do not want the Pantherans to know how advanced our technology is.

Aloud she asked, "What can you give me?"

"Positional information and some activities," Captain Star Runner replied.  "At present no vehicles are in the star system."

"Where did they go?" Ronnie asked.

"I am searching for them now," Captain Star Runner said.  "They are not in Mother Space therefore they must be here."

And they were, three vehicles altogether.  Each one deployed to a planet so that all three Confederation planets each had a Pantheran vehicle orbiting it.  Star Runner confirmed that each vehicle was a Pantheran military vehicle.  The probe provided identification codes.  The vehicles were traveling undisguised and openly.

"The probe's best vantage point is Marathon," Captain Star Runner reported.  "The vehicle is retrieving messages from their satellite.  The probe can detect the data transfer."

They waited.

"The vehicle has transmitted to the satellite.  I cannot read the transmission."

Another pause.

"The vehicle is powering up an energy weapon, probably a laser-based weapon."

Pause.

"The vehicle has destroyed both interplanetary satellites."

"Breaking off all off world communication," Gyllian murmured.

"The satellites would have burned up in the atmosphere in a short amount of time," Captain Kidd observed.

"True enough," Gyllian agreed.

Captain Star Runner said, "Energy weapons are powering up again.  There are fine beams being directed at the planet."

Gyllian bit her lip.  This did not sound good at all.

"I have identified the target.  It is the space port used for interplanetary travel."

"They are isolating the planets," Ronnie said.

"And they are eliminating all sites of manufacturing and use," Captain Star Runner said.  "There have been a total of nine pinpoint discharges of energy."

The group in the lounge waited.  Hollis sat frozen, a writing wand in his hand.

"The vehicle is moving off and joining the other two," Captain Star Runner reported.  "They appear to be rendezvousing to exit the star system."  Later Captain Star Runner said, "They are in Mother Space moving away.  I am recalling the probe."

"Is it safe to return to the star system?" Gyllian asked.  "Have they detected our presence here in hyperspace?"

"I am preparing to insert into normal space," Captain Star Runner replied.  "I cannot say for certain if our presence was detected or not.  I can say there was no hesitation in their trajectory coming into Mother Space and proceeding on their way."

"Where were they going?" Gyllian asked.

"Their trajectory retraced their approach trajectory," Captain Star Runner said noncommittally.  "I have no idea where they came from and where they are going."

That was true enough, Gyllian reflected.  Star Runner had no idea where those ships had come from and where they were going.  Analysis of their identification codes might tell her who they were and perhaps where Marathon and its sister planets figured into the bigger scheme of the Pantheran Empire's master plan.  To date, no human had any idea what it was.

"Can we see what the data transmitted to the satellite said," Gyllian asked aloud.

"We need to be closer," Captain Star Runner said.  "How fast do you want to return?"

"Let's not strap down," Gillian decided.  "I don't think there's any hurry."

Captain Star Runner was obviously impatient.  The acceleration of the ride hovered between one point ten and one point twelve Earth normal gravity.  They all felt the increased gravity, but it was not so great as to be complained about.

"What will happen next?" Hollis asked in a small trembling voice.

"We will have to see what the message says," The Czarina said.  "Speculation would be pointless now."

"But they destroyed the satellites and spaceships," Hollis protested.  "What are you going to do about that."

"There is nothing we can do about it right now," Gyllian said, trying not to be too dismissive.  "The rebellions on Marathon make it impossible for anything to be rebuilt right now.  In time, who can say?"
** Section Thirty-Six:  What the Pantheran Message Said
The message was straight forward enough.  Dangerous Daniels had asked for hard precious metals in payment.  The Pantherans rejected that claim outright.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Our contract contains no provision for cash payments of any kind.
#+END-QUOTE
The message went onto say
#!BEGIN_QUOTE
We have fulfilled our part of the bargain thus far.
1.  We have provided you with the means of communication with us.
2.  We have provided you with a master plan for securing each planet under your total control.
We are disappointed at the speed of planet transformation.  To show our dissatisfaction, we have given you a sample of what the Pantheran Empire can do when it is displeased.
#+END_QUOTE
The message ended with a vague threat of Pantheran return and reprisals.

Everyone sat quietly when Christabel finished speaking.

"I should say they made a bargain with the devil," Captain Kidd observed.

"What can we do?"

Everyone turned in surprise to Hollin.  No one had expected her to contribute though she had agreed to join them.  Maybe no one could look at fashion videos forever, Gyllian thought.

"I have been thinking," Hollin said.  She looked around the room for encouragement.

"Go on, dear," The Czarina prompted.  "We are all listening and want to hear what you have to say."

Hollis made a face but a stern look from The Czarina caused him to duck his head.

"Hollis and I were trained to run The Royal Province of Debussy on La Mer," Hollin went on after a short hesitation.  "Our family has ruled there for thousands of years.  We are one of the oldest ruling pairs on Marathon."

"The oldest," Hollis put in.  "We are older than the Royal Province of Barbara of Portugal and the Principality of Telemann."

"I do not think that matters now," Hollin said.  "Have you been reading the reports Christabel is providing?  Most royals are dead or imprisoned.  They will probably be dead soon or become merely figure heads.  Everybody we knew is dead, seriously injured, captured or hiding out somewhere.  We cannot go back to the life we had.  That life is gone forever.  These Pantheran people sound horrid.  I want to know what we can do about it.  I do not want them destroying my planet even if I do not think it is safe for you and me, Hollis, to go back there."

"Spoken like a true queen," The Czarina said.

Gyllian suspected The Czarina was exaggerating and suspected, too, that The Czarina did not believe her own praise.  However her words made Hollin smile, just a little.  Perhaps they would even give the young woman courage.  She and her brother would need courage in the years to come.

Gyllian said, choosing her words carefully, "I represent human beings who live outside of the area of space where Pantherans rule," Gyllian said.  "I am not a diplomat so I cannot make binding agreements with you and Hollis.  I can bring you to the people who can.  We also work with human beings inside the Coalition where the Pantherans rule.  That organization is called The Solar League."

"And why do you have a Pantheran on this spaceship?" Hollis asked.

"Captain Star Runner left the Pantheran Empire," Gyllian said.  "From time to time the Alliance of Planets for whom I work hires Captain Star Runner for certain missions like this one."

"Because he knows about Pantherans?" Hollis asked.

"No, because Captain Star Runner is what the Pantherans call a star runner, an individual who is trained to run spaceships.  Captain Star Runner knows a lot about getting into and out of hyperspace which is very useful.  Captain Star Runner's AI, Christabel, who you have spoken with, is one of the best AI's in the western spiral galactic arm."

Ronnie put her hand over her mouth.  Gyllian shot her a warning look.  Gyllian was praising both Captain Star Runner and Christabel a great deal but more or less everything she was saying was true.  If she said much more Captain Star Runner would ask for a raise in price for the contract.  That could be difficult  given the already exorbitant amount negotiated and the probable cost overruns.  She always had to explain why Captain Star Runner was both absolutely necessary and why she always ran over budget when Captain Star Runner was employed.

"I want to fight them, too," Hollis said, turning to Gyllian, "What can we do?"
**  Section Thirty-Seven  An Alliance Ship Arrives
...
"I need to speak with Dangerous Daniels," Gyllian said.  She turned to Ronnie.  "I want you to come with me."

"No way," Ronnie said. If Gyllian thought she would leave Captain Star Runner's ride until she had a safe and secure place to go where she would have access to her credits and and she could live in a modern city, Gyllian was deceiving herself.  Ronnie would even tolerate a long enforced run on a starship before she agreed to revisit Marathon.  She would never go back to 202 Green Street.  She was certain about that. 

At the same time, Hollis said, "I will go with you." 
"You!" Gyllian said.  "Why you?"

"I want to confront the man that did all this to my family and to my country," Hollis said.

"It could be quite dangerous," Gyllian said.  She wanted to dissuade this young man from a foolish idea of setting things right.  Gyllian had an entirely different plan in mind.

"Then why are you going?" Hollis asked.

"I want to make Dangerous Daniels a counter proposal," Gyllian said.  It was good practice to say your plan out loud.  The others could poke holes in it and point out any errors of logic or action she had thought of.

"You want to work with that scoundrel?" Hollin demanded.

"I do not really want to," Gyllian assured the royals.  "I want him to work for human beings, not for the Pantheran Empire.  He just received a threat of destruction from the Pantherans.  I want to suggest he work for us and that we will protect the three planets from the Pantherans."

"How will you do that?"  The question came from an unforeseen source.  It was Captain Star Runner who asked that question.  "Will you place a garrison here?"

Everyone waited for Gyllian to answer the star runner.  Captain Star Runner and Captain Kidd knew how difficult it would be to maintain such an outpost.  There would have to be a supply line, defenses against a Pantheran attack and the very real possibility of a war breaking out to defend the three planets from annihilation.  Was Gyllian willing to commit the Alliance of Planets to such a costly and difficult action?

Gyllian took a deep breath.  "If the Alliance of Planets and the Solar League do not make a stand here, where will they do it?" she asked in return.

"Can you convince your government of that?" Captain Kidd asked.  It was a reasonable question.

"My portfolio at the present time is protecting the Three Planets," Gyllian said.  "I think making this proposal is part of that portfolio."

"But you have not asked for official sanction to do that yet, have you?" The Czarina asked.  Her journalistic skills were rarely far from her talent to get answers to questions.

Gillian's bluff had been called.  She did not have the the authority to do what she proposed.  She knew it and the other people on board the ship knew it, too.

"Captain Star Runner, can you send a priority message," she asked.

"Certainly.  I can only encrypt it with the level of encryption I have at my disposal" Captain Star Runner said.  "Is that sufficient?"

"Send it on a very narrow beam to Emily Dickinson," Gyllian said.  "I will give you the wrappers.  It will seem innocuous enough."

They had to wait for a reply.  Captain Star Runner parked the ship in geosynchronous orbit over Capital City.  Captain Star Runner worried about setting the ship down on the planet when the situation continued to be volatile.  Without the satellites, it was difficult to know what was happening.  Fortunately there were radio waves Christabel could monitor.
** Section Thirty-Eight  Back in Capital City

Instead of a message, an Alliance warship arrived.  Properly speaking, Ronnie thought, it did not arrive.  It waited in hyperspace until Captain Star Runner opened an extraction point for them to enter the star system.  It was a delicate maneuver as Captain Star Runner was not a tug pilot by training.  Due to Captain Star Runner's extreme skill as a star runner though, the fuchsia-colored Pantheran was able to keep the extraction point stable so that the warship could come out of hyperspace.

"I do not know why," Captain Star Runner confided in Ronnie later, "the Terries do not invest in jump gate technology.  They complain all the time about the military of The Race, but they take no responsibility at all to learn how to operate in Mother Space.  Getting in and out is a basic tenant of running a star travel capable vehicle."

Ronnie did not know the answer to that question, but she stroked the side of Captain Star Runner's face.  "It was a good thing you were here to map the coordinates and provide expertise to get the starship through," she said.

"This is turning out to be a very profitable contract," Captain Star Runner said in reply.  "I will not undertake another one from Gyllian until I am fully compensated for this one.  I will need the capital to mend fences at the Half Moon Bay Space Station."

"Do you have a shipment that is behind schedule?" Ronnie asked.

"Not at all," Captain Star Runner said.  "I am just not there when they thought they could expect me.  I do need to be reliable."

Emily Dickinson was aboard the Alliance warship and quickly came aboard Captain Star Runner's ride.

"How are you doing, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson boomed in the Control Center.  "Is Gyllie keeping you busy?"

"I am working per our contract," Captain Star Runner replied.  "I have mapped insertion and extraction points in a great deal of the area of this star system."

"And are you keeping Ronnie happy?" Emily Dickinson asked.

Captain Star Runner understood Emily Dikinson very well.  They had a long and at one point, intimate, relationship.  "Private Investigator Ronnie Camberwell is as happy as she can be aboard a space vehicle far from her home," Captain Star Runner said.

"Well you keep up the good work, pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said, patting Captain Star Runner on the shoulder.  "I have to talk with Gyllie."

But Gyllian was busy conferring with the captain of the Alliance warship.  Captain Trail Likoy had come in response to Gillian's query regarding enlisting Dangerous Daniels as a counter agent and recognizing Hollis and Hollin as the legitimate spokespersons for the Three Planets.

"It is a difficult situation," Captain Likoy Trail said.  "We understand your reasoning, but the expense is great.  I am empowered to grant your proposal based on my reading of the situation here."

"I fail to     understand why a warship captain has greater authority than I do," Gyllian said.  "I am a Colonel in the Ministry of Defense."

Captain Likoy Trail shook his head.  "I have never understood the brass," he confided.  "But I will be the one to set up the liaison between these planets and our government so I suppose they think I will know if it is workable."

"I suppose that makes a certain amount of sense," Gyllian admitted, "and I do not have anything against you personally, but I will bring this matter up with the Minister of Defense when I return to the Alliance."

"I would do the same in your position," Captain Likoy Trail agreed."As for the two royals, I have been instructed to have you bring them back to the Alliance for immersion in modern society."

"My thoughts exactly," Gillian said.  "I propose to meet with Dangerous Daniels as he is known and make the proposition I spoke of in my message.  The boy, Hollis, wishes to accompany me."

"Three of us will go," Captain Likoy Trail said.  "Daniels should know who is he is dealing with."

So it was that the three, fully covered in impervious clothing, traveled to Marathon in Captain Likoy Trail's shuttle.

"Now remember," Gyllian said to Hollis, "let us do the talking."

"And remember, young man, that you are only protected where you are clothed," Captain Likoy Trail admonished.  "Fortunately, it is still winter and we can cover most of your body without drawing attention to that fact.  Your face is exposed.  Be very careful."

Both Gyllian and Captain Likoy Trail had refused to give Hollis a weapon.  Both of them were armed.  His lack of training with modern firearms spoke against him carrying any.  Hollis had insisted on carrying a knife and Christabel had fashioned one to his specifications.  Several models were fabricated until Hollis was satisfied.  Christabel had made a note to request the Fungusian Network add a variety of knife patterns and background of knives to her database.  Captain Star Runner heartily endorsed this though no one could imagine Captain Star Runner wielding such a weapon.  Captain Star Runner, on the other hand, delighted in the idea that knives could be part of its own identity as a pirate.

The three trudged through the city.  They were all shocked by the destruction.  No one was out on the streets.  It was snowing.

When they reached the Rocky Bluff neighborhood, the streets were still deserted but there was less destruction.

"The Rebel Horde takes care of its own," Captain Likoy Trail muttered.

Hollis swore.  He was not good at it, but he was trying to be grown up.  Both Gyllian and Likoy Trail knew he was shaken when he saw the destruction of the Royal Precincts.

When they reached 202 Green Street, Gyllian produced the key Ronnie had given her.

"We go in. I deliver my message.  We leave," Gyllian said.  "Nothing extraneous.  No remarks from the peanut gallery either."  To underscore her meaning, she pointed at Hollis.  "You are an observer only."

"I would like to kill him," Hollis said with a certain degree of vibrato.

"Never mind that," Captain Likoy Trail said.  "Your weapon is for defensive purposes only."
Gillian unlocked the door and push it wide.

Three people  sat around the table in the center of a room off the hall, Mrs. Farnesworth, Dangerous Dan and Teddy.  Gwennore was not there.

"And who are you coming into my house," poppy Farnesworth demanded.

"I have a key," Gyllian said.  And to Dangerous Daniels, "I am Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo.  I represent the Alliance of Planets and The Solar League."

"And who are they when they are are home?" Teddy said.  Dangerous Daniels said nothing.  He just stared at them as if they would melt away from the intensity of his gaze.

"You have made a risky bargain," Gyllian continued, still speaking to Dangerous Daniels.   "The Pantherans have destroyed all your satellites, all your spaceships and your ability to construct any more of them.  They have isolated you.  They have no intention of playing fair with you.  You have played into their paws.  You are like a mouse the cat is playing with."

Captain Star Runner would growl at her use of a cat image for Members of the Race, but Gyllian thought it would emphasize her point.  After all, Teddy had seen a Pantheran face to face.

"That big cat does not scare me," Teddy boasted.  "I know how to handle him."

"Captain Star Runner is not the Pantheran you need concern yourself with," Gyllian said.  "It is the entire Pantheran Empire you have allied yourself with and they are very dangerous."

"I am very dangerous," Dangerous Daniels finally spoke.  "Teddy, Poppy, blow these people away."

"With pleasure," Mrs.. Farnesworth said, leveling her gun.

"I get  the kid," Teddy said, pointing his gun at Hollis.  "One less royal to deal with.  Do not cry, little boy.  Die like a man."

But they had spoken too much.  Likoy Trail sliced off Mrs. Farnesworth's head.  Gyllian burned a hole in Teddy's chest.

Dangerous Daniels dove under the table.  He was, as many bullies are, a coward, depending on other people to protect him.   Hollis followed him down to the floor and stabbed him through the back.

Retrieving his knife he said, "I suppose it is not honorable to stab a man in the back, but it is not honorable to make a pact with a dishonorable bunch of aliens that once before planned to annihilate us."

He wiped the blood from his knife on Daniels trouser leg.

"Let's go," Gyllian said.  "There may be some fail safe systems we do not know about."

Gyllian re locked the door.  Maybe that would slow the knowledge of the deaths at 202 Green Street..  They walked casually along, not drawing attention as best they could.  When they were several streets away, they hurried to the shuttle.  Captain Likoy Trail had left two crew members guarding the shuttle.  They never saw Gwennore.

Back aboard the ship The Czarina said, "Do you think it was wise to kill them all?"

"They were not willing to negotiate," Gyllian said.  "I am hoping that by eliminating that group, a better group will emerge with which we can negotiate."

"Will this be useful?" Hollis asked, pulling something from a pocket.

"Where did you get this?" Gyllian asked.

"It was in Dangerous Daniels trouser pocket," Hollis said.  "I noticed it when I wiped my knife."
Gillian said.  "This is wonderful.  I suspect there is only one.  

"We can seed the satellite with messages from time to time," Ronnie said.  "When the Pantherans check it, they will think the plan is going forward."

"An excellent idea," Gyllian said.  "I will have the experts work on this back home."

"Speaking of home," Ronnie said, "I think we should be on our way."

"An excellent suggestion," Captain Star Runner said.

*  Chapter Eleven:  What Happened Next
**  Section Thirty-Nine:  Ronnie's Dilemma
Gyllian did not respond to Ronnie's suggestion that Captain Star Runner take them home.  There was much arranging to be done to have Captain Likoy Trail begin the process of setting up a post in the star system.  The large moon that orbited Marathon seemed like the best place.

"I want to check out what happened on the other two planets," Gyllian said.  "Captain Likoy Trail has provided me with a shuttle craft.  It can attach to this vehicle so that you will not have to land."

Captain Star Runner agreed.  Gyllian and another Alliance military person did a survey of each planet.  All the destruction was not as widespread as it was on Marathon, it was just as complete.  Government which had been more loosely organized on the other two planets had ceased to exist.  There were local leaders from The Rebel Horde in charge, but they were no longer receiving instructions from Marathon.  Gyllian made her same offer to those she could find.  To a strong person, her offer was refused.  The Pantherans seemed like stronger allies who promised more than the Alliance of Planets could.

"Why are we hanging around?" Ronnie asked.  She, The Czarina and Captain Kidd was sitting in the lounge.  Captain Star Runner was asleep in preparation for completing the survey of insertion and extraction points Gyllian had initiated previously.  "Why does Gyllian need all this information.  There's a task force coming to set up a jump gate.  The particular insertion and extraction point has already been determined.  We believe the Pantherans know how to unlock the point in the Pharaoh Star System.  I do not understand what good it is for us to be here.  Gyllian can work from Captain Likoy Trail's ship."

The Czarina went and sat next to Ronnie on the couch.  She patted her hand.  "may I offer you some friendly advice?" she asked.

Ronnie was startled.  This was a side of The Czarina she did not know.  First she was mothering toward Hollis and Hollin.  Now she was offering her advice and patting her hand.  Ronnie was not a demonstrative person.  She kept herself to herself as much as possible.

"I guess," she said.

"As advice goes, it may be worth what you are paying for it which is nothing at all, but in my experience, what I am telling  you has been true.  You will be unhappy if you are always thinking about what might have been or what could be.  Dreams and aspirations are fine.  Regrets are part of life, but being happy right where you are is a condition you must cultivate to be happy.  I understand that your long voyage with Captain Star Runner and others broke up your marriage to Star Runner."

Ronnie nodded.  "I hated being aboard a spaceship for that long," she said.

"And why was that?" The Czarina asked.  "Ptolemy City is an enclosed space.  It is bigger than a spaceship, but it functions very similarly to one."

Ronnie said, "There was nothing to do.  There was no way to get away from everybody."

"This is a good-size spaceship," The Czarina said.  "Oh, it is not a passenger liner with endless restaurants, lounges and entertainments, but for a working vessel which is what this one is, there is a lot of open space.  The staterooms are small, but as you know, the cargo area can be adapted for human use.  If you want a retreat, why not ask Captain Star Runner to set aside some space for you?  Hollin and Hollis have been moved up here with the rest of us.  That lounge area can be yours.  It is big enough for Captain Star Runner to move around in it.  You could create quite a lovely place."

"She's been so busy with the ride," Ronnie said.

"Well tell her to be less busy," The Czarina said.  "It probably has not occurred to our good captain that you need attention and some recreational time with you."

"I am not so good at setting up a place," Ronnie said.  "I did no decoration at all with my cooperative space."

"Well, dear, I can certainly help you if you want me to."

"Do you think that would be a good idea?" Ronnie asked.

"I think it is an excellent idea.  We will check with Christabel to see if the space is needed for something else and if not, we will get to work."

To Ronnie's surprise, Captain Star Runner was delighted at the new space.  She turned around and around looking at it.  Ronnie always thought dogs showed their excitement this way, not cats, but she did not mention this to Star Runner.  To be compared with either human pet irritated the fuchsia-colored Pantheran.

"Since we are stuck here," Ronnie said, "I thought we should enjoy ourselves." Then despite what she and The Czarina had talked about, she said, "How much longer do you think you will be?"

"Working here in this star system?" Captain Star Runner asked.

"Yes, with Gyllian," Ronnie added.  She did not want to bring Gyllian up especially here in their private space, but she could not help herself.

"My contract with her is fairly open-ended," Captain Star Runner explained.  "It pays well.  Even though it looks like I am doing much, I am being paid."

"And is that all you care about?" Ronnie asked.  "You want to be with me but then you work on this crazy contracts with Gyllian."

There.  She had finally said it.

Captain Star Runner raised her eyebrows in that quizzical gesture that indicated she was confused.

"I do not understand," she said.  "I want to be with you.  I am with you and you have just made this lovely flat out of unused cargo space where we can be together.  Those lovely portholes with those beautiful star scapes gives this whole area a sense of being just the two of us among the stars."

"The portholes are fake, of course," Ronnie said in disgust.  "They are just pictures."

"But they are dynamic," Captain Star Runner said, "Are they a feed of where we really are?"

"Yes, of course," Ronnie said.  "Christabel is sending those pictures down here.  We can change what direction we look."

"It is wonderful," Captain Star Runner said.  "You are wonderful.  This area is wonderful.  I do not feel as constricted as I do in a stateroom or even the lounge area with all its furniture and people."

"You have been so tied up with your work," Ronnie said.  Where was she going with this?  She wanted to ask Captain Star Runner a question but she did not even know what the question was.There was something between them and it had to be resolved if only she knew what it was.

Captain Star Runner was silent.  This was very uncharacteristic of the fuchsia-colored Pantheran.

"What are you discussing with Christabel?" Ronnie asked.  Star Runner only went quiet like this when she engaged in an intense conversation with Christabel.

"I am thinking," Captain Star Runner said.

Again she was quiet.

"What are you thinking about?" Ronnie asked.

"I have stayed in the Control Center for a reason," Captain Star Runner said.

"And what is that reason?" Ronnie asked.  Her stomach clenched.  This was going to be bad news.

"I know you and Captain, I need to remember to say, Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo do not get along very well," Captain Star Runner said.  "I know one of the reasons is that she and I were once lovers and you worry that I want to be her lover again."

Captain Star Runner stopped speaking.  For once Ronnie did not say anything.

"Am I right about this?" Star Runner asked.

"Yes," Ronnie said.

"Christabel thinks," Captain Star Runner said, stopped and then went on.  "Christabel thinks Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo sometimes thinks about renewing our relationship.  I cannot be certain for myself.  This uncertainty bothers me.  I like knowing things for sure.  Anyway, I want you to know for sure that I am your lover exclusively.  I know that being this way is important to you and that it is the only way we can stay together."

Ronnie started to cry.

"Why are you crying?" Captain Star asked.  She was very concerned.  "Why are you sad?  I thought my saying this would make you happy and feel secure."
"I am happy," Ronnie said as she continued to sob.  "Sometimes people cry when they are happy.  Captain Star Runner, I love you so much and she put her arms around the fuchsia-colored Pantherans neck and hugged her.

"I think that is very strange," Captain Star Runner said, "but if you are happy then everything is OK.  We will have to decide what we will do when this contract is finished."

"I thought you needed to go to Half Moon Space Station," Ronnie said.

"I would like to go to Half Moon Space Station," Captain Star Runner corrected her.  """"Would you be interested in going there?"

"I do not know," Ronnie said.  "What is it like?"

"I do not know a great deal about the space station," Captain Star Runner said.  "I do know it is a good place to pick up short-term contracts.  Being a Member of the Race is not a problem there.  I would not be under the scrutiny of the Empire there either, I do not think.  There are many human-like people living there.  You should fit in with them.  Perhaps they need a private investigator."

"I would have to learn the laws there," Ronnie said, trying the idea on.  "I would have to learn the technology."

"Christabel can help," Captain Star Runner said.

"But Christabel will be off with you on your contracts," Ronnie said.

"Christabel and I will speak with the Fungusian network," Captain Star Runner said.  "They will be able to provide you with a suitable database.  Of course they will want you to share information with them."

"Not my confidential information," Ronnie objected.

"Not that kind of information," Captain Star Runner said.  "They want to learn about the space station and how it operates and about the peoples who do business there.  They do not have a lot of information about that arm of the galaxy and you could help them gather that information.  If we share information, it makes paying for their databases and systems much cheaper."

"So you will share with them what you learned here," Ronnie said.

"Absolutely," Captain Star Runner said.  "In return, they will update my systems with the latest AI upgrade and expand our databases.  Christabel needs more information on knives, for example."

"OK," Ronnie said.  "Maybe you and I need to go to a new place and make a fresh start."

"I like the adjoining arm<" Captain Star Runner said.  "And Christabel says I need to tell you something else."

Again Ronnie's stomach clenched.

"The Czarina and Captain Kidd have been talking to me about the adjoining arm.  The Czarina wants to visit to do one of her splashy reports.  They would like to come.  I did not agree yet.  I was waiting to talk to you about that."

"Why did you not say anything to me about all this?" Ronnie asked.

Captain Star Runner lowered her head and looked away.  "I was afraid," she admitted.  "I was afraid you would be mad at me and not want to come.  If I promised them and made a contract, I would have to go and take them and you would not be with me."

"Now I know why people call you a silly pussy cat," Ronnie said, stroking Captain Star Runner's face.

Star Runner was not far from the mark.  Ronnie might have responded badly to Star Runner's suggestion.  It was better that it was Ronnie's idea to begin with.

**  Section Forty:  Wrapping Things Up in the Marathon Star System
Captain Star Runner and Gyllian finished mapping the insertion and extraction points.  Star Runner identified those that the Pantheran military would be most likely to use though Captain Star runner thought they would probably use the one the last vehicle to enter the Marathon Star System had used.  The garrison under Captain Likoy Trail's command continued to be built.  Survey equipment and staff arrived to make a full survey of the three inhabitable planets as well as those which were not easily inhabited.  They were particularly fascinated by the area Ronnie had once thought was the Democracy of Rock and Roll.  With their surveying equipment, their maps revealed a complex system of castles, waterways and what was likely to have been roads.  They were certain the ruins were from the human beings who had come into the star system.  There was no indication anywhere that another race had once lived here.  Without extensive excavation, they would not know what had happened.  The site was added to those in Tamara's department at the University of the Gifted Mind on Socrates that required archaeological investigation.


At last Gyllian considered her work done.  As Captain Star Runner prepared to enter Mother Space, Gyllian sat down to write her reports.

The question which remained was what to do with Hollin and Hollis.  Various ideas had been proposed, but none of them seemed quite right. 

"We both want to help the Three Planets," Hollin said. "we have been talking about it like adults, knowing we have to work together.  We know more about what is going on in the Marathon Star System than anyone else."

"I think Hollin and I need to learn a lot about what the rest of humanity is doing," Hollis said.  "Maybe we should take courses at the University of the Gifted Mind."

"Or maybe the University of the Gifted Mind could devise a special program for us," Hollin said.  "We are used to working with tutors.  Maybe they can give us special tutors."

"We have to figure out how to represent our star system's interests, too," Hollis said.  "the garrison on the larger moon is a good start to help protect us, but we need to educate everybody in the star system about what is going on.  There may be some royals still alive or even some of their advisors that could be part of our team.  Captain Likoy Trail has agreed to help us identify leaders.  Not everyone is as bad as Dangerous Daniels and the others.  Some people just felt our old system only favored some people while lots of other people were poor and wanted a better life."

They were certainly getting a quick education on the state of their worlds.  Gyllian thought the Marathon Star System was in good hands.  She planned to introduce to Oscar.  He and his colleagues to develop a reasonable plan and keep them on task.  Oscar was not an exciting person to be around but he was reliable, responsible and a clear thinker.

When they entered Mother Space, Captain Star Runner and Ronnie spent a lot of time in their private suite in the cargo bay.  It was, Gyllian thought, probably for the best.  As attractive as Captain Star Runner was, engaging in an affair with him would be problematic for everyone, especially her.  Her time with Captain Star Runner could have been intense, but it would never last.  Gyllian knew that from past experience.  Ronnie, with her line of work, could relocate at will.  She was tied to the Ministry of Defense.  She had a certain set of principles she had to maintain and was not as free as Ronnie was to associate with anybody she pleased.  Ronnie had gone down some rabbit holes in this investigation, but Gyllian should have brought her in earlier and not involved her as a red herring in the plan to discover who The Rebel Horde was.  Ronnie could have been far more useful to her as an informed under cover agent rather the hapless victim she became.  Gyllian had had no idea how dangerous the people she lived with and had to associate with were.  She had so badly misjudged the situation.

Gyllian waited for Ronnie and Captain Star Runner to join the group in the lounge.

"Can I have a private word with you?" Gyllian asked.

"I guess so," Ronnie said.  She was ill- at ease.

Ronnie and Gyllian excused themselves to sit in the stateroom everyone called the office.  They sat in facing chairs.

"I owe you a great apology," Gyllian said to Ronnie.  "As you know,, I rarely apologize.  Apologies make a person look weak and in my business, looking weak is a liability.  It becomes a habit after a while."

She paused.  Ronnie said nothing.  She just waited for Gyllian to continue.

"I owe you an apology," Gyllian repeated.  "I put you at grave risk rather than asking you to help me.  I was wrong.  Not only was it irresponsible to risk your life, I missed out on your investigative skills.  You would have been better to solve the question of who The Rebel Horde was if you had had the proper resources, been protected from the bads guys and had enough to eat and were warm.  I am sorry."

Ronnie sat unspeaking.  Gyllian waited.  Finally Ronnie said, "Thank you.  I know our relationship is very difficult.  We have our different relationships with Captain Star Runner.  We even think of Captain Star Runner in a different gender.  I was in a very difficult situation.  As I have thought about it, I have realized my own unwillingness to travel with Captain Star Runner and my own arrogance in thinking I could establish myself as an investigator on an alien world added to my problems.  I am glad it is over.  I hope in the future if I can be of assistance to you that you will not hesitate to ask me."

This was better than Gyllian had hoped.

"I know you and the others from the Pharaoh Star System are traveling to Half Moon Bay Station after you drop Hollin, Hollis and me off.  Although we have our hands full with the Pantherans at the moment, I often get assigned to work with unusual projects." She sighed.  "It does not help my career, I do not think, but it is interesting.  I want to establish some kind of relationship with the people in the adjoining arm.  Perhaps you will be able to identify who those people are.  Please stay in touch."

She stretched out her hand.

After a short hesitation, Ronnie put out her own and they shook hands.

**  Section Forty-One:  Off on a New Adventure
It took some time at Grand Central Station to get ready for the new adventure.  Captain Star Runner went to Fungusian Network space for Christabel to be debriefed and for all the ship's systems to be reviewed and upgraded as needed.  Featherote engineers came to confirm, as far as they could tell, that all the structural and mechanical aspects of the ship were in good order.  Captain Star Runner would have the ship thoroughly checked out when they went to Half Moon Bay Space Station.  This model of starship was well known there.

Ronnie, for her part, took a chance to catch up with Josh Levins.  Things were going well for him.  His contact with the Fungusian Network made his expertise in demand.  He passed along a message from Tara Lee O'Rourke.  Tana Lee asked if Ronnie would put in a good word for her at the Ministry of Defense.  Ronnie was happy to let Gyllian know that Tara Lee was looking for another position.  Gyllian thought there might even be a civilian post at the Ministry of Defense for Tara Lee to fill.  The novelty of the Alexandria Space Station was wearing thin.

"The passengers may change," Tara Lee told Ronnie, "but the problems pretty much remain the same."

They parted on good terms.  Tara Lee asked after Captain Star Runner.

"You have always been in love with her," Tara Lee said.  "I have always known that.  I was foolish for thinking I could change your mind about that and I am sorry I behaved so badly at the end."

"I was unkind," Ronnie said.

"You were star struck in more ways than one," Tara Lee said.  "You can also find out if they have an opening in the security department on Half Moon Bay Space Station."

Ronnie laughed.

"I am serious, girl friend," Tara Lee said.  "Maybe this alien lover thing is the way to go.  You are certainly happy and you sure sound like she's the best."

"She is," Ronnie said, "but you were no slouch, trust me."

"I will," Tara Lee said.  "And do not forget to tell me if there is an opening."

When Ronnie cut the connection, she realize Tara Lee was quite serious and quite serious about an alien lover.  Well, it worked for her.  Maybe it would work for Tara Lee, too.  Ronnie wanted Tara Lee to be happy the way she was happy, the way she had never been happy until now.
Ronnie took Captain Star Runner's idea about being an investigator on a space station.  There was no work for her on Grand Central Station, but she took the opportunity to explore the station.  Grand Central Space Station was much larger than Alexandria Space Station.  She determined she walk every corridor the public was allowed to enter.  She was even able to get onto some corridors which were marked no public access.  She spent time watching star ships docking and leaving.  She learned about the passenger terminals and the shipping docks.  Although she ate at least one meal a day at the Rock Island Line Diner and received special treatment because she was Captain Star Runner's partner, she also sampled many of the other eating establishments on the space station.  Captain Star Runner had set up an account for her and stressed she could spend it all.  This gave her immense freedom.  Ronnie had always understood Captain Star Runner was a wealthy spaceship operator.  Her settlement had been generous back in Ptolemy City.  Her allowance here was staggering.  Ronnie worried about paying her own way and becoming dependent on Captain Star Runner, but the fuchsia-colored Pantheran assured her that she would never be beholden to her.  A special account was set up with seed money should Ronnie ever need to have her finances kept independently.

The Czarina's blog went live just before they left.  The Czarina was very mysterious and very salacious as usual.  She promised to next speak to her fans from a very alien location.

They were all in very high spirits when they went aboard Captain Star Runner's ride to head for Half Moon Bay Space Station.

The End
