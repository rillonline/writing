After sorting my lines using =m-x sort-lines=, I have discovered org
itself has a sorting lines function. Here's how to use it.

1. Highlight the list you want to sort.
2. Press =c-c ^= (carat or s=6).
3. You will be prompted to indicate what kind of a sort you want.
   -  a for alphabetical
   - f for function which I will not cover
   - n for numeric
   - x for checkboxes

   If these letters are capitalized, reverse order is used.

That's it.
