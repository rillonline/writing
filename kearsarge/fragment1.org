a guy from school--

"You know," I said aloud, "I bet the Fungusians could find out."

"I'm sure they could," an unfamiliar voice said.

I looked around. No one was near enough to hear me.

to see me on short notice.


"How
long would it take to send a query to the Fungusian Network? And How
much would it cost?"

"The Fungusian Network processes requests promptly," Susan answered as
if her quickness advertised Fungusian responsiveness. "The message could
be sent and returned in a day and a half. The cost is reasonable."

"A day and a half?" I was flabbergasted. "The Fungusian Network is quite
distant."

"There is a direct communication pathway from the Pharaoh Star System to
the research laboratories in the Fungusian Network. Therefore the cost
is similar to contacting locations on the Northern and Southern
Frontiers."

Captain Star Runner again. All of Star's AI systems are produced by and
serviced by the Fungusians. Of course there is a direct pathway to the
research labs. Star probably figured out how to cut through hyperspace
to get there as quickly as possible. It would not be difficult for a
message routed to the research labsõ‚‰…õ€ˆšâ–½  to be dispatched to the correct
sub-network.

In for a penny, in for a pound.

"I want to ask the Fungusians if they can determine where Kearsarge's
messages are coming from. I believe you have the particulars Kearsarge
sent me. Explain the nature of the investigation and I only want the
information that will be useful to solving the mystery."

"Got it. The message is on its way."

That simple. I realized that life with Captain Star Runner opened me up
to the possibilities of reaching far out into the galactic western arm
for information I needed. I was not too uncomfortable talking with Susan
either. All that time aboard Star's ship gave me ample time to adjust to
talking with Christabel, Star's AI. I began to think the artificial
intelligence was my rival. When I muttered something of that sort in
Christabel's hearing, she, and Christabel is definitely a she, replied,
quite primly as I remembered it,õ‚‰…õ€ˆšâ–½  that at some level she and Star
weren't separate identities. They shared brain and computer memory
space. The whole thing was just a bit creepy. In the good times, I tried
to ignore Christabel's presence altogether.


"I'll need general information about the planet Fair Haven on the Southern
Frontier," I said after a little while. "I want to know if either
Kearsarge or Samuel Cornelius Mudd are known to the general profile of
the planet."
