  <p>Title: Signs and Wonders</p>
<p>Text: Acts 9:31, 34-41</p>
<p>Date: June 16, 2019</p>
<p>Place: Bay View United Methodist Church, Milwaukee</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus. Amen.</p>
<p>I come into your midst and speak to you about signs and wonders on this Trinity Sunday, a Sunday also devoted
to peace and justice.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks about events outside our ordinary experience,: The sun standing still for twenty-four hours,
Jonah spending three days and nights in the belly of the whale. Indeed, you say, but these are stories from long
ago. they can be dismissed. The Bible says Jesus fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish. Many of
you may say, but isn’t it more reasonable to think people just shared what they
had? Isn’t that wonder enough?</p>
<p>Although it continues to surprise me, I know many of you have trouble with metaphors and poetic language. You
want facts and figures, something quantifiable and measurable. Something known not imaginary. I am willing to
bet, however, that even you played games as a child, read stories and watch movies. So let us step into a world
of signs and wonders, the world of the Book of Acts, the world of the early church. Come with me to Joppa and to
Tabitha’s house and meet the only woman called a disciple in the New Testament.</p>
<p>What do we know about Tabitha? She lives in Joppa, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea. Although widows are in
her house when Peter arrives, her own marital status is unknown. This suggests Tabitha is a woman of independent
means. She is able to perform good works especially providing clothing for widows and their families.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter of Acts, after baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch on the Gaza road, “Philip found himself at
Azotus, and as he was passing through the region, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to
Caesarea.” (Acts 8:40 NRSV)</p>
<p>I wondered just how far a walk that was so I typed into a search engine:
How far is it from Azotus to Caesarea. I expected to find a series of biblically focused websites
which would give me the info. No. The answer was there on my screen: 60 miles from Ashdod to
Caesarea. Temperature: 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Traffic is
light.</p>
<p>I have no idea if traffic was light when Philip worked his way up the coast. I do know Ashdod is the present day
name of Azotus.</p>
<p>Philip would have passed through Joppa on his way home. Tabitha may have heard Philip preach and he may have
baptized her. I like to think so.</p>
<p>However Tabitha comes to know Jesus, she becomes one of his disciples and performs good works and makes
charitable donations. Then she gets sick and dies. Nothing out of the ordinary here. You have known lots of
people like her. Good people who give generously to the people around them and then they are gone leaving a hole
in your lives no one else can fill.</p>
<p>Now messengers go to Lydda to ask Peter to come back with them.</p>
<p>This is not the bungling disciple of the Gospels. This is Peter who has come into his own at Pentecost. This is
the Peter who stands up to the authorities in Jerusalem and leads the early church. This is the Peter who
performs signs and wonders in the name of Jesus. Some examples given in Acts: Peter has</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>actively healed a lame man at the Beautiful Gate of the temple</p></li>
<li><p>passively healed sick people put out into the streets so his shadow
passes over them</p></li>
<li><p>Healed a bedridden man named Aeneas in Lydda where he is now.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Their errand is urgent. Peter goes with them without delay.</p>
<p>Walking to Lydda is like walking from Bay View to the Sergeant Clinic
in Wauwatosa. The messengers walk
back–all in one day. It’s about 8 miles in each direction.</p>
<p>Ministry is hard work. And in this case, the hard work is walking, walking to get somewhere, walking with carts,
mounted riders and chariots whizzing by with no regard for pedestrians. No sidewalks. Just a road with everyone
on it. Ordinary people doing an ordinary task, walking from here to there. No one they passed has any idea what
will happen next.</p>
<p>The scene at Tabitha’s house is one of sorrow and excitement. The widows crowd into the room, anxious to share
with Peter all the good work Tabitha has done for them. They are anxious to tell Peter about how wonderful
Tabitha was, trying to capture the essence of the person she was to help a stranger know her as they do.</p>
<p>Then we get a glimpse into the divine realm. Peter clears the room. He
prays. He takes Tabitha’s hand and says, “Get up.”</p>
<p>Tabitha, living in a city
where we have no record of a Christian church until the fifth century,
finds herself lying in her upper room
with a man she has never seen before holding her hand and telling her
to rise. No wonder she sits up.</p>
<p>Our reading today has been building to this moment, when the ordinary becomes the extraordinary. The power of God
is loose in Joppa. Tabitha lives.</p>
<p>The good news spreads quickly and many come to trust in Jesus. But surely there were those who called it, by our
contemporary language, fake news. How could a woman be raised from the dead. This is not a sign of God’s power.
This is propaganda from a fringe religious group seeking attention.</p>
<p>I am certain Tabitha had to put down her sewing more than once to talk to a curiosity seeker. You can picture
it, can’t you? She is hemming a cloak when someone comes in and starts questioning her. The temptation is great
to send the stranger away. She is busy. But instead she, and perhaps the widow she is helping, sit down, hem
trailing, to give their witness to this stranger.</p>
<p>This is what these signs and wonders are all about. They show the power of God to create and to sustain what God
has made, the power of God to comfort and to strengthen God’s people, the power of God to save God’s people for
all time. They give disciples like Tabitha, disciples like you, a chance to talk to a stranger about Jesus and
your relationship with him. This is what it means to walk in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy
Spirit. This is how the church grows and keeps its focus on its mission: sharing
the good news with the whole world, one person at a time, one conversation at a
time, if necessary.</p>
<p>“Come
and hear more on Sunday,” Tabitha says
when the stranger leaves. “Jesus died on the cross and rose to life
forever. This is the greatest sign of all. And the greatest wonder of all is that
Jesus died and God raised him from the dead so that we, too, can experience this
forever life. This body of mine
will die again, but because of Jesus, I am here today, an ordinary woman,
performing an ordinary task, helping
someone less fortunate than me, sharing the good news with you.</p>
<p>Tabitha is a wonder not just for the first century
people of Joppa. She is a sign of Jesus’ promises and assurance
for each one of you.
Peter presents Tabitha not just to the widows in some far off city long ago but
to you so that you may be certain that death is not the last word. Jesus won the victory
over death not just for himself, not just
for Tabitha, but for you and everyone you love. Jesus and Tabitha live
and so will you. Amen.</p>
