What follows is a transcript of podcasts I produced in 2006 for Advent.  For the most part, I have not changed anything from what you will hear if you listen to the audio files. Because I have discontinued my web site referenced in the podcasts, I have updated the transcript with my current site and contact information.  I hope that these writings will be a blessing to you on your spiritual journey.

I recorded these reflections using the name /Merrill Louise/. It never stuck.

Advent may be an unfamiliar word to you.  It means coming or arrival.  It is the time YOU AND I will set aside during these podcasts to prepare our hearts and minds for Christmas.  In real life, our preparations may include 
-  Shopping for presents for other people

   -  wrapping them in pretty paper
   -  tying ribbons and affixing bows

-  decorating our home, inside and out

   -  with colored lights
   -  scented candles
   -  garlands
   -  Santas
   -  reindeer
   -  snowmen and women

-  and special sayings like

   -  Ho! Ho! Ho!
   -  Merry Christmas!
   -  Seasons Greetings!
   -  Happy Holiday!

-  decorating the Christmas tree
-  planning, preparing and making special meals
-  baking cookies and other delectable treats
-  playing OR singing Christmas carols and songs
-  giving and going to parties

The intent of all these activities is joy---the joy of

-  giving and receiving gifts of love
-  sharing good food with good friends and family,
-  celebrating friendship and family ties
-  expressing the hope that the world really can be a place of joy and    peace

Sadly, we know our preparations often fall short of our expectations of ourselves, of others and the season.  We work ourselves into a frenzy out of a sense of duty rather than joy.  We spend more than we have.  We get stressed out.  We snap at family members, coworkers and friends.  We feel rushed, panicked that everything will not be perfect or even get done.  We feel lonely.  There is something missing.  We don't feel as happy as we think other people are.  We despair.  We think there is something wrong with us because the so- called spirit of Christmas hasn't touched us--our souls.

Real life spirituality acknowledges all the healthy ways you and I prepare for Christmas.  Presents are wonderful.  Christmas cookies taste delicious.  Decorations enhance our living and working spaces.

Each year, for the four weeks preceding Christmas, the season of Advent invites you and me to take a few minutes every day

-  to open ourselves to God
-  to reflect on Jesus' birth, its meaning for and impact on us
-  to respond to God with love and joy

I hope these short reflections, inspired by the [[http://www.americanbible.org/][American Bible Society]]'s daily readings for November 30-December 25, 2006 will bring Advent Joy in your heart, joy that you can share with others and with God as your relationship with God grows deeper in joy this Advent season.

** A Word about These Podcasts

Each podcast will begin with a quotation from the Contemporary English Version of the Bible.  These quotations will be a portion of a longer reading which I will announce.  I hope you will find time during the day to read or listen to this longer passage.  After I read the Scripture quotation, I will reflect on it, speaking about how it helps us prepare for Jesus' arrival at Christmas.  I will conclude each reflection with a very short prayer.

* CALL TO ACTION

Thursday, November 30, 2006

The reading is Psalm 150.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Praise our God! His deeds are wonderful, too marvelous to describe.  (v. 2)
#+END_QUOTE

How do you go about preparing for Christmas in real life?  You may be beginning by making a list

-  going to the store to browse
-  doing a web search
-  asking advice
-  checking on what you already have on hand

Spiritual preparations for an event are no different.  Psalm 150 calls us
to action, too.  Let me list the activities. 
- shouting 
- dancing
- strumming
- plucking
- blowing
- clashing

It's all quite noisy.  It's all quite different from hushed worshipers engaging in solemn introspection.  Self-examination is a useful activity.  Nevertheless, Psalm 150 invites us to loud and showy praise of our God en lieu of lengthy descriptions of all God's marvelous deeds.

So 
- crank up the music if you're not wearing ear buds.
- Grab that sweatshirt with the words Joy! JOY! JOY! Written across your chest.

- Swing your hips.
- Get a bounce in your step.
- Sing along with the in-store carols.
- Smile.
- And if you're up to it, a few Ho! Ho! Ho!'S won't hurt anybody.

You're not crazy.  You're praising God with your whole self and sharing your joy with everybody around you.

Let us pray ... Wonderful God, may my praise of you be rambunctious and contagious today.  Amen.

The reading is Jeremiah 33.1-13.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Then someday, I will heal this place and my people as well, and let them enjoy unending peace. (v. 6)
#+END_QUOTE

Someday â€¦ It is a word that haunts me.  How many promises have I made, how many promises have been made to me that begin someday. 
+ I heard it as a child.
+ I said it as a parent.
+ I said it as a lover.
+ Lovers have said it to me.

Someday â€¦ 

Making promises and not keeping them is a form of betrayal.  It also labels us as unreliable.  When I became aware of this, I sought to refrain from making promises I wasn't absolutely sure I could keep.  Instead of characterizing me as totally truthful, it marked me as unwilling to commit myself.

Someday â€¦

In today's reading, God says it to the prophet Jeremiah who is imprisoned in Jerusalem, a city under siege.  Someday I will â€¦ let them enjoy unending peace.

Truth is, we can choose whether or not to trust God.  In the case of Jeremiah, the city fell.  Most of the citizenry were taken captive and exiled in Babylon.  Within a generation the people had an opportunity to return to the city.  Some did.  Most did not. 

As we all too well know, peace is not the absence of war.  It is the fullness of life well-lived.  That is the peace God promises€”not just the absence of enemies at the gate.

In Advent, you and I can let our longings bubble to the surface.  We can trust God that someday peace will be ours to enjoy and live accordingly.

Let us pray â€¦ God, may my longing for peace in my heart, peace in my home and peace in the world be satisfied.  Amen.

The reading is Jeremiah 33.14-26.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I promise that the time will come 
When I will appoint a king from the family of David, 
A king who will be honest and rule with justice.  (v. 15)
#+END_QUOTE
Whoa!  What is going on here?  What does the politics of the Middle East, then or now, have to do with preparing for Christmas?

Sometimes Jesus is referred to as the son of David.  As Davidâ€™s descendant and Godâ€™s Son, he rules over the universe in royal splendor.  However, if you have the feeling 
  + Youâ€™ve been had
  + some slight of hand is being employed here
  + some reverse engineering is happening
  + it is a major leap from regional politics to the cosmic order of things

I can certainly understand yourconfusion.

A king who will be honest and rule with justice and a city which will be named The LORD Gives Justice is something both the people of long ago and you and I long for today.  Kings in the ancient world were responsible for the well-being of everyone under their rule from each member of their own household to the tiniest child in the farthest village.  Then as now the ideal and the reality didnâ€™t line up very closely.  To name Jesus as Davidâ€™s son, to acknowledge Jesus as a member of Davidâ€™s royal family, is a shorthand way of putting our longing for good governance and justice for all into words and say it out loud.

Let us pray â€¦ Jesus, Davidâ€™s son, I long for your justice to fill me and the whole world with joy.  Amen.


* Tour Guide

First Sunday of Advent, December 3, 2006

[[https://archive.org/download/advent_joy_2006/advent_joy_2006-12-03_tour_guide.mp3][tour_guide.mp3]] from [[https://archive.org/][The Internet Archive]]

The reading is Luke 21.5-38.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
So, when you see these things happening, you know that God's kingdom will soon be here. (v. 31)
#+END_QUOTE

Remind me never to have Jesus as my tour guide.  Stop to gaze at the spectacular temple King Herod the Great built for his people and you get an earful about the apocalypse.  To be fair, in the arc of the story of Jesusâ€™ life, death and resurrection, this exchange takes place two days before Jesusâ€™ crucifixion. 

So â€¦ what is this text doing here in our Advent reading?

Jesus is talking about preparing for the end of the world as we know it.  He is using what is called apocalyptic language: a code to let his listeners know he is talking about The End--capital T capital E.  The images of natural disaster, violence and human suffering are part of this way of speaking.  It doesnâ€™t tell us anything about the particulars of The End or its timing.  War and famine, the suffering of refugees and natural disasters have gone on throughout history.  Sadly, no matter when I record this segment and you listen to it, these things are happening right now.

After The End, a time of peace and joy will come . Jesus invites us to prepare now for a life beyond
  + What impresses us today
  + the fears we have for the future
  +To a fresh perspective on life and a new way of living

The shorthand for this new perspective and this new way of living is Godâ€™s kingdom.

Traditionally  in Advent, we reflect on how we have lived and HOW WE are living our lives now.
  + What changes do we need to make?
  + What changes do we want to make?

Jesus invites us, through the symbolic language about The End, 
  + to act as if this new perspective and new way of living is possible right now
  + to be joyful and peaceful today.

Let us pray â€¦ Jesus, let me experience the joy of acting and feeling like Godâ€™s kingdom is already here.  Amen.
* Belonging to God

The reading is Psalm 24.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Who may climb the LORD'S hill 
or stand in his holy temple? (v. 3) 
#+END_QUOTE

For as long as I can remember, Psalm 24 has been one of my favorite passages from Scripture.  Godâ€™s majesty and grandeur are evident throughout the entire psalm--from creation to Godâ€™s glorious entrance into the temple.
  + Spatial arrangements catch my attention
  + The world set  on the oceans and rivers
  + God on the hill 
  + A question about who can climb this hill

Going up to Jerusalem or Zion is a common phrase in the Bible to denote traveling to the city.  It is literally true . The temple was built on Mount Zion.  Because of their height and seeming nearness to heaven, mountains are often associated with the divine.

Todayâ€™s reading focuses our attention on what we mean by holy.  Godâ€™s hill is described as holy.  The people who step foot on this hill must be holy, too.  Surely, we say, that is not I.
  + I am not a holy person. 
  + I have faults. 
  + I have doubts. 
  +I am not worthy.

In its simplest usage, holy means belonging to God.  No other judgment is made.  The psalm identifies three things which belong to God:
  1. the hill itself
  2. The temple on the hill
  3. The people climbing the hill to worship God.

In our daily preparations, we declare to whom we belong--
  + Our friends
  + Our families
  + Our lovers
  + Our communities of
    = Work
    = Home

In our spiritual lives, by declaring us to be  holy, God declares boldly that we are Godâ€™s.

Let us pray â€¦ Glorious God, may the joy of belonging to you fill my heart today.  Amen.

* LOVING JERUSALEM, PRAYING FOR PEACE

The reading is Psalm 122.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Jerusalem, we pray that you will have peace, 
and that all will go well for those who love you. (v. 6) 
#+END_QUOTE

For the rest of this week, we will be reflecting on some of the Psalms of Ascents or worship.  No one is sure how this little collection of psalms came to be.  They may be psalms pilgrims sang or recited while traveling to and from Jerusalem.

What does it mean for us to reflect on pilgrim psalms? 
  + We do not make such journeys. 
  +We do not think of God residing in a specific place.
  + We do not feel anything special toward this city, perhaps to any city.

Whenever I record todayâ€™s reflection and you listen to it, sadly, there will not be peace in the Middle East.

Whenever I record this reflection and you listen to it, violent events will be occurring in Jerusalem, in all the populated places around the globe.

Yet, for all these thousands of years--and it has been thousands of years--people have prayed for the safety of the city, for the safety of their friends and relatives. 

In Through the Looking Glass the white queen tells Alice that she has believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.  While preparing for Christmas  we believe, or pretend to believe, many more than six impossible things as fanciful as flying reindeer and as grave as grandma doesnâ€™t really have cancer or Daddy will be coming home soon or the person I love loves me just as much as I love him or her.

Jerusalem is a holy city.  God loves Jerusalem.
  + Jews believe this.
  + Christians believe this.
  + Muslims believe this.

During Advent, may our joy be loving Jerusalem, too.  Let us believe the impossible: Jerusalem will be at peace.

Let us pray â€¦ May Jerusalem have peace, and may all go well for those who love this city.  Amen.
