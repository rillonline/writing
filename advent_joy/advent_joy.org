What follows is a transcript of podcasts I produced in 2006 for Advent.  For the most part, I have not changed anything from what you will hear if you listen to the audio files. Because I have discontinued my web site referenced in the podcasts, I have updated the transcript with my current site and contact information.  I hope that these writings will be a blessing to you on your spiritual journey.

I recorded these reflections using the name /Merrill Louise/. It never stuck.

You may want to edit the /m3u/ file as the reflection for /December fifth/ is out of order.

Advent may be an unfamiliar word to you.  It means coming or arrival.  It is the time YOU AND I will set aside during these podcasts to prepare our hearts and minds for Christmas.  In real life, our preparations may include 
-  Shopping for presents for other people

   -  wrapping them in pretty paper
   -  tying ribbons and affixing bows

-  decorating our home, inside and out

   -  with colored lights
   -  scented candles
   -  garlands
   -  Santas
   -  reindeer
   -  snowmen and women

-  and special sayings like

   -  Ho! Ho! Ho!
   -  Merry Christmas!
   -  Seasons Greetings!
   -  Happy Holiday!

-  decorating the Christmas tree
-  planning, preparing and making special meals
-  baking cookies and other delectable treats
-  playing OR singing Christmas carols and songs
-  giving and going to parties

The intent of all these activities is joy---the joy of

-  giving and receiving gifts of love
-  sharing good food with good friends and family,
-  celebrating friendship and family ties
-  expressing the hope that the world really can be a place of joy and    peace

Sadly, we know our preparations often fall short of our expectations of ourselves, of others and the season.  We work ourselves into a frenzy out of a sense of duty rather than joy.  We spend more than we have.  We get stressed out.  We snap at family members, coworkers and friends.  We feel rushed, panicked that everything will not be perfect or even get done.  We feel lonely.  There is something missing.  We don't feel as happy as we think other people are.  We despair.  We think there is something wrong with us because the so- called spirit of Christmas hasn't touched us--our souls.

Real life spirituality acknowledges all the healthy ways you and I prepare for Christmas.  Presents are wonderful.  Christmas cookies taste delicious.  Decorations enhance our living and working spaces.

Each year, for the four weeks preceding Christmas, the season of Advent invites you and me to take a few minutes every day

-  to open ourselves to God
-  to reflect on Jesus' birth, its meaning for and impact on us
-  to respond to God with love and joy

I hope these short reflections, inspired by the [[http://www.americanbible.org/][American Bible Society]]'s daily readings for November 30-December 25, 2006 will bring Advent Joy in your heart, joy that you can share with others and with God as your relationship with God grows deeper in joy this Advent season.

** A Word about These Podcasts

Each podcast will begin with a quotation from the Contemporary English Version of the Bible.  These quotations will be a portion of a longer reading which I will announce.  I hope you will find time during the day to read or listen to this longer passage.  After I read the Scripture quotation, I will reflect on it, speaking about how it helps us prepare for Jesus' arrival at Christmas.  I will conclude each reflection with a very short prayer.

* CALL TO ACTION

The reading is Psalm 150.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Praise our God! His deeds are wonderful, too marvelous to describe.  (v. 2)
#+END_QUOTE

How do you go about preparing for Christmas in real life?  You may be beginning by making a list

-  going to the store to browse
-  doing a web search
-  asking advice
-  checking on what you already have on hand

Spiritual preparations for an event are no different.  Psalm 150 calls us
to action, too.  Let me list the activities. 
- shouting 
- dancing
- strumming
- plucking
- blowing
- clashing

It's all quite noisy.  It's all quite different from hushed worshipers engaging in solemn introspection.  Self-examination is a useful activity.  Nevertheless, Psalm 150 invites us to loud and showy praise of our God en lieu of lengthy descriptions of all God's marvelous deeds.

So 
- crank up the music if you're not wearing ear buds.
- Grab that sweatshirt with the words Joy! JOY! JOY! Written across your chest.

- Swing your hips.
- Get a bounce in your step.
- Sing along with the in-store carols.
- Smile.
- And if you're up to it, a few Ho! Ho! Ho!'S won't hurt anybody.

You're not crazy.  You're praising God with your whole self and sharing your joy with everybody around you.

Let us pray ... Wonderful God, may my praise of you be rambunctious and contagious today.  Amen.

The reading is Jeremiah 33.1-13.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Then someday, I will heal this place and my people as well, and let them enjoy unending peace. (v. 6)
#+END_QUOTE

Someday â€¦ It is a word that haunts me.  How many promises have I made, how many promises have been made to me that begin someday. 
+ I heard it as a child.
+ I said it as a parent.
+ I said it as a lover.
+ Lovers have said it to me.

Someday â€¦ 

Making promises and not keeping them is a form of betrayal.  It also labels us as unreliable.  When I became aware of this, I sought to refrain from making promises I wasn't absolutely sure I could keep.  Instead of characterizing me as totally truthful, it marked me as unwilling to commit myself.

Someday â€¦

In today's reading, God says it to the prophet Jeremiah who is imprisoned in Jerusalem, a city under siege.  Someday I will â€¦ let them enjoy unending peace.

Truth is, we can choose whether or not to trust God.  In the case of Jeremiah, the city fell.  Most of the citizenry were taken captive and exiled in Babylon.  Within a generation the people had an opportunity to return to the city.  Some did.  Most did not. 

As we all too well know, peace is not the absence of war.  It is the fullness of life well-lived.  That is the peace God promises€”not just the absence of enemies at the gate.

In Advent, you and I can let our longings bubble to the surface.  We can trust God that someday peace will be ours to enjoy and live accordingly.

Let us pray â€¦ God, may my longing for peace in my heart, peace in my home and peace in the world be satisfied.  Amen.
