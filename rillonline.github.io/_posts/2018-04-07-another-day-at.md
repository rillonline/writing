It has been another day at home

* no appointments

* very cold weather

* lots of odds and ends to do

So what exactly did I do today?

* I created my shopping list in the Pick and Save app. Although it makes more sense to make a list instead of adding my items to the shopping cart, (I won't checkout from the cart.), the app is set up to add to the cart and it is an extra step, as far as I can tell, to add something to the shopping list. The cool thing about the shopping list is that you can check off the item presumably when you put it into your cart.

I think I am buying more because I am able to peruse the store.

* I recorded a quick demo of the *Tunein Live* Alexa skill for the Dot To Dot podcast. It is a paid skill with a 7-day free trial. It gives me access to Tunein premium content. I pay for this on my phone. (I pay a premium there.) It is a lot cheaper on my Amazon Echo. I started Tunein Premium originally because I had access to a variety of audio books as part of my subscription. I figured if I read a book a month I broke even. The books have been dropped from the program and I have been meaning to cancel my subscription. I can get my baseball games, but it is cheaper to use my dedicated MLB subscription. Besides, the baseball stream on my phone was not as reliable as the dedicated app. So why would I want to pay for *Tunein Live*? I can stream some premium stations like Aljazeera English, C-Span and Young Turks.  It is far more likely that I will stream these at home rather than when I am out and about. I do drop into a baseball game when I have some down time when I am away from home.

* I did the laundry. Laundry is manageable when the machines are in your home. When they are coin-operated and downstairs, they are barely tolerable. There is coming and going, setting timers and discovering that half the machines are out-of-order.

* I caught up with a young friend from guide dog school. It was good to hear her voice over audio messages.

* I posted to Facebook to see how other guide dog handlers find bus stop poles. They mostly assured me that my dog would catch on if I use the bus frequently which I currently do not do. If I get the route to [Vision Forward](https://vision-forward.ord) down, this may be the case. Whether Nick will start recognizing bus poles out in the wild remains to be seen.
