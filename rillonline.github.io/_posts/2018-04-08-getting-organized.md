I  did not write yesterday. Even though my plan was to write every day, the only thing I wrote was a list of things to write today.

What I did do was purchase [MarsEdit](https://red-sweater.com) so that I can fully access my [micro.blog(https://rill.micro.blog).  The iOS app is not fully accessible; neither is the web site. This makes editing my posts difficult if not impossible after they are posted. With [MarsEdit](https://red-sweater.com) I can work on my Mac and fix any mistakes.

What I did not realize initially was that my blog posts were in plain text. My markdown was not working because I had not set up an "About" page.  I will have to make sure they are now properly formatted.

I am still pretty shaky with MarsEdit. I hope I can become more proficient in the future.

I am trying to write this post using my Braille display. It is quite hard at the moment because I am using

* a new app
* my Mac
* andthe Braille display

I am shaky using the Braille display connected to the Mac and I haven't consulted the documentation. Soon I will have to look up how to control the Mac with this device.

Later ...  Markdown is working on the site. I used different ways of indicating unordered lists and different strategies for posting  so the lists look different even in the same post:* simple lists
* white bullets* and regular bullets
In any case, MarsEdit 
is working with my blog [rill.micro.blog](rill.micro.blog).
