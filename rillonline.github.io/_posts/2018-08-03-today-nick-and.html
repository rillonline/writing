  <p>Today Nick and I celebrate our second anniversary.</p>
<p>Nick and I had a rocky start. I was originally matched with a different dog, Chance. Chance did everything I asked to do except go fast. I decided I didn’t want to bring a dog home that would likely slow down and then I would be very frustrated. I asked for a new dog.</p>
<p>Chance left in the morning. I went to lunch dogless. At lunch I learned one of the other students had to leave class due to an injury. I even passed him as he was leaving.</p>
<p>In my room, my instructor brought my dog to me. I was in love immediately–a yellow Labrador Retriever male–big and beautiful.</p>
<p>“Full disclosure,” my instructor said. “This was Stanley’s dog.”</p>
<p>I have always felt badly that in order to get Nick Stanley had to get hurt. If only he had received Chance and I was initially paired with Nick.</p>
<p>I don’t know what this was all about– Do things happen for a reason? Well, I’ve always been glad Nick was not paired with a newby.</p>
<p>Nick has always been a difficult dog.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nick doesn’t like obedience. He remains a toddler. “Why?” Why do your want me to sit now? Why must I lay down? Once Nick figures this out for imself, he is quite willing to do so. He has finally figured that when people get up at the Sharing of the Peace at church, we are not preparing to leave the service.</p></li>
<li><p>Nick continues to be difficult to park. We go out. Nick does number one. Then Nick often is willing to start to go inside. Then he will literally make a U-turn and return to the grass for number two.</p></li>
<li><p>Nick came home with an ear infection. I treated that. Soon afterwards, Nick’s foot became infected. Licking. Licking. Licking. The vet decided he had a condition called Canine Atopic Dermatitis. I think of it as itching from the inside out. They tell me it is genetic. He is on a grain free diet which I must supplement with canned pumpkin and a laxative. My initial problems parking Nick may have been caused by Nick being so uncomfortable on grass. It is still amazing to me that Nick worked as well as he did with his medical issues.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Nick still goes fast. He has never slowed down. He marks his territory, sniffs poles, gets distracted by other dogs. I often wonder if he was a C student. He learns slowly.</p>
<p>All this said, I never thought about returning him. He was my forever dog.</p>
<p>He is working here in the city, on buses, vans and busy city streets. He can see a route once and follow many turns inside a busy building. He is learning to talk to me about needing to park, about an empty water bowl and a late dinner. He is exploring talking to me when it is time to get up.</p>
<p>This is a happy day.</p>
