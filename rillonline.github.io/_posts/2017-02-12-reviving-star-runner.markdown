I have been stymied for some time because I do not have the initial story arc of Star Runner fully written and finished. I started the Star Runner Adventures at the beginning of 2007. It's about ten years then and high time to get this project back on track. I have tried several approaches, but my best bet is a novelette or long short story. After trying, and failing, to develop Star Runner as an adventure game on the Inform7 platform, I realized a very simple plot with a limited focus might be my ticket out of my dilemma. To this end, I am focusing on Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and Captain Star Runner: how they became friends and how Captain Star Runner was recruited for the FRONT, Free Residents of the Northern Territories.
