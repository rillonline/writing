<p>Today we walked around the neighborhood. I totally missed Pine Street on the other side of 3rd. I will have 
to re-educate Elwood that this is not a pedestrian mall as I had originally indicated. I figured it out when we 
had walked too far and then came to North Main. 
<p>We are still working on the park issue. At the curb is 
working best and will be more practical long term. We just couldn't practice at the Seeing Eye. It's the moves 
which we could have practiced along with the cars, stationary and otherwise, we couldn't practice. Elwood is 
eating though I cut back his food since we are not on school schedule so sooner or later something has to 
happen. 
<p>We went to the 5 o'clock service. Elwood thought it was quite peculiar that I wanted him to turn 
right after the building and didn't understand that the sidewalk with steps was his goal. I am teaching him to 
lay under the pew. Elwood was not thrilled about this. I spent a lot of the service putting him back in 
position. Fortunately, Episcopalians believe in assigned seats so I will be able to teach Elwood where to sit.
