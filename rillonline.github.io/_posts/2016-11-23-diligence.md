> Brother Lawrence said that in order to form a habit of conversing with God continually and referring all we do to Him, we must at first apply to Him with some diligence. Then, after a little care, we would find His love inwardly excite us to it without any difficulty.

> The Practice of the Presence of God

I am pausing and my reading of Brother Lawrence to save this quotation. This is where I find myself currently--at the beginning.

In my ([previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-11-22-the-winter-tree %}), I failed to mention the title of the book.

Diligence is not one of my virtues. I get excited about things and work on them for a while, but I often lose interest. I am far more hare than tortoise. On the other hand, I often come back to projects and work on them for a while longer.

In reading brother Lawrence, I find it is important to read slowly And carefully. As a result, I am finding reading him in text to speech is easier then listening to someone else read. Brother Lawrence is similar to poetry or Scripture reading in this way.

Learning to read and study this book is my first task on this journey.
