Looking around my apartment, it is clear I do not put a value on furniture. I have a table and chairs from IKEA and I sit on the couch from hospice. The other furniture is from family, hand me downs, some are called antiques now and some collectibles. Well, I guess I have collected them. Spending a lot on furniture apparently is not something I do.
