The Wizard of Marling. I now know a little more about him.
He is the dead wizard in my novel I am planning call *The Griner's Stand Mystery*. (Of course, it could be renamed to the Wizard of Marling.)

The planet is Marling. It is not part of the Magic Lands. And here lies the problem: wizards are not allowed to practice magic outside of the Magic Lands. Special permission was given for the wizard to go there on a secret mission.

A long time ago, wizards moved freely through Tigerfu controlled space. But not all wizards are benign. In fact, without strict supervision and constraints, they are most likely to become enamored of it and use it repeatedly to curry favor or gain power and riches. The general populace resented and feared the wizards, hunted them down and killed as many as they could. The Tigerfu despise civil unrest and lawlessness so a treaty of sorts was forged between the wizards and the rest of the population. The wizards were given the Magic Lands and prohibited, for the most part, from traveling anywhere else in Tigerfu space.

With diminished numbers and the realization that new wizards would continue to be born, the non-wizard population agreed to test Tigerfu to see if they had any potential and these candidates were sent to the Magic Lands.

This is not as disruptive to the Tigerfu as you would think. The instances of wizardry in their population is rare. Since the Tigerfu continue to be afraid of the wizards and misinformation abounds, the population is happy to have these individuals dismissed. The candidates, for their part, believe it is their responsibility to everyone else to retire to the Magic Lands where they can be useful to society. Usefulness rather than individual satisfaction is very important to the Tigerfu.

What disturbs the Tribunal is that the Wizard of Marling as he is known locally, has used his powers for his own aggrandizement while performing his work for the Tribunal. His death is not important to the Tribunal. His data pouch is. Ronnie is to recover it if at all possible. Solving the mystery around his death is not her assignment. Ronnie thinks knowing who killed the Wizard of Marling will lead her to the data pouch.

Ronnie herself, as a powerful and as yet not fully trained, wizard and Tripp have been given permission to travel to Marling to recover the data pouch. The authorities do not want wizard-related information to fall into the wrong hands especially with a war going on. Ronnie's remit is vague, but her instructions from the Tribunal are not. She and Tripp argue over Ronnie's thesis that the Wizard of Marling was killed for the data pouch and finding his killers will lead them to the data pouch. Tripp is not an investigator. She is a junior wizard who Ronnie likes and who can stand for Tigerfu values.
