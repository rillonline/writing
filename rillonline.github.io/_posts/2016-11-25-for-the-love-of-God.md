The simplicity of Brother Lawrence's understanding is astounding. His methodology is very straight forward:

* Do everything for the love of God.
* Andif not, confess your failing and then move on.

There are no rules to follow, no time frame. The practice is the practice. That is all.

The diligence comes, for me, at least at this point, to remember the love of God even once before setting down to read Brother Lawrence.

I think Brother Lawrence would say, "Confess it," and go on And so I have and so I will.
