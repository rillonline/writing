  <p>Today is Election Day in Wisconsin. My polling place is in my Community Room. No excuses. Go and vote in the Spring Election.</p>
<p>In the past, I have been very timid going into a new situation. Somewhere along the line, I have become more bold. I walked in and said, to no one in particular, “Hello.” A woman directed me to someone who could help me register. I explained I was new to the city and needed to transfer my registration from another city in the state. Shockingly, I needed only to have lived for ten consecutive days at my current address. I am used to needing to live forty days in the county. I needed to show my ID and give my former address. I signed two papers:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>My new registration</p></li>
<li><p>Because my name was not in the book, the paper was necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I decided not to have someone fill out my ballot for me. I used the talking voting machine for the first time. It took a little while to set it up. It is not used often.</p>
<p>I now know to bring my own wired headphones. I had to use the provided ones and the sanitation issues could be a concern. I had to adjust the volume and the speed of the speech. I wanted it loud and fairly slow so I could really understand what I was doing. This is an election after all.</p>
<p>Here in Wisconsin, we use paper ballots. The ballot is fed into the machine and there is a pause. I assume the machine is scanning the ballot.</p>
<p>After everything was set up, I listened to the instructions. The buttons are different shapes and large. Controls are labeled in Braille. I used a right arrow to move from contest to contest. I used the up and down arrows to review my selections. When I was done with each contest, I pressed the square button which is labeled with an s for select.</p>
<p>At the end, I had a chance to review my choices and hit the final select button.</p>
<p>There was a significant amount of clanking while the machine actually marked the ballot and then spit it out. After that, I just needed to insert it into the slot to be counted.</p>
<p>I left the poll with a “I voted” sticker, making sure it was right side up.</p>
<p>The poll worker remarked that we could at least get the sticker right side up because so much else in the world was up side down.</p>
<p>I wondered that she made such a reference. I did not think election workers could make any such comments.</p>
<p>When I was five I went with my mother to vote. The voting machines were mechanical. You step into the booth, close the curtain and pull down the levers associated with each of the candidates you want. When you are finished, you slide the curtain back. There is a wonderful mechanical sound as the votes are tallied. At the end of the day, the poll officials will open the back and get the vote count for each machine. I once brought two kids, one guide dog and mzf into the booth. That was certainly chummy.</p>
<p>Back to 1956.</p>
<p>A state trooper wasalw on duty at the polling place. (I don’t know if Wisconsin has a police presence. I will have to inquire.) I knew the trooper. I went to school with his daughter. I went up to him and opened my coat in order to show him all the election buttons I was wearing.</p>
<p>This caused a commotion. Displaying the buttons is considered electioneering at the polls which is illegal so I had to close my coat very quickly.</p>
<p>I am certain one of the buttons was “I Like Ike”. I have no idea what the others were. #BlogEveryDay</p>
