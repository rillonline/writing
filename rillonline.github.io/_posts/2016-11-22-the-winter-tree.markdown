title: The Winter Tree
---

When my daughter was just three years old, she was cast as the angel in
the Christmas pageant. When the time came for her to tell the shepherds
about the Christ child, she did not speak. The adult in charge prompted
her, but she continued not to speak. The play went on. Afterwards,
I asked her why she didn't say anything. She said, "they already knew it.

I think prayer, or at least my approach to prayer, is a lot like that. God
already knows

* what is on my heart
* what is wrong
* what needs to be done

What is there for me to say?

Scripture teaches me otherwise.

* I am to speak to God all the time.
* I am to treat God as a friend.
* I am to nag God when necessary.

To try to do something about my lack of engagement, I started reading
Brother Lawrence's essay. I've heard of Brother Lawrence for years,
but I have never read him.

In the First Conversation, brother Lawrence explains that he came to
his faith by observing a tree, specifically, a tree in winter. There
were no leaves on the tree. I imagine the clacking of the branches as
the winter wind blows through them. There is, brother Lawrence explains,
God's providence: spring will return. The tree will receive its leaves
and buds. It will blossom.

I've not been big on providence. It seems as if it comes to some and not
to others. But my impression is that brother Lawrence is talking about
God's promise. That although things may seem bleak now, the richness
of life and God will come. We can count on it, just like we expect the
spring to follow after winter.
