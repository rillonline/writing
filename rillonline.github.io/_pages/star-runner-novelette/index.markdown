# Prologue

Today the Secretary General closed all Coalition borders.

I have taken this unprecedented action,” the Secretary General said, "in order to keep the lawlessness that has invaded our Space. Although I know this will be a hardship for those who have family and business interests outside Coalition borders, I have been forced to institute these stringent measures because some elements have seen to prey upon Coalition 	citizens and Coalition interests, disregarding the rule of law and the Space Conventions. I have ordered Coalition fleets Alpha through Theta to coordinate patrol of jump points. Local authorities have been requested to patrol their own space. Failure to maintain closed borders will result in interdiction and immediate expulsion from the Coalition. Such unilateral decision-making flies in the face of our cherished heritage of cooperation; however, difficult times demand difficult decisions and resolve.

"I call on all members of the Coalition to hold firm against the forces of chaos and lawlessness to preserve our way of life and so that these matters can be dealt with quickly. When order has been restored, our borders will again be open for the healthy exchange of ideas and commerce we have formerly enjoyed with non-coalition worlds."

In a pig's eye," Kirk Langley said as the news commentators resumed their chatter over the bar's vidcaster. Kahlua has been itching to close the northern border for years. Now its got its chance."

"Yeah, Kirk," a spacer at a nearby table said, "but here on the Northern frontier things are getting very ugly. The Ursula is overdue. that makes the fifth ship this year and that's just here on this space station. We're hardly the crossroads of the Arm. I've heard it's like this all over."



Everyone stopped talking, turning their attention to the only Pantheran they had ever seen in the flesh. No one knew why, but Captain Star Runner was the only Pantheran they had ever seen with a rich fuschia-colored fur. And unlike other Pantherans, it had a star of white fur on its forehead.

The spacers would have been surprised to learn the whit fur shamed the beautiful star runner. Ungendered Pantherans were supposed to be a solid color. But like its color, the star marking and its white socks were unique to the handful of fuschia-colored Pantherans ever born.

"Maybe she got caught when the Border closed," another Spacer said.

"Nah," the first said. "She was stopping at Ellison's World. That's beyond the border. She operates outside of Coalition space, well, usually. Garrison has no love for the Coalition."

Mutters of assent circled the bar. Captain Garrison's dissatisfaction with the Coalition was well-known on Dirty World Station. Ellison's World  was part of his regular route. The fact that Garrison and Ursula were overdue was unsettling. If anyone could withstand, outrun or outwit the pirates or rebels or whatever and whoever they were, it was Captain Garrison. Nevertheless, Ursula was overdue..

The spacers continued to mutter among themselves while the vidcaster continued to analize and speculate about the General Secretary's words.

Nevertheless the spacers' attention were drawn to the lounge's entrance. Captain Star Runner filled the doorway, its eyes scanning the room, its ears twitching as it took in their words and that of the vidcaster, its nose quivering, its whiskers stiffening on either side of its mouth.
I held my drink between my paws. I had stopped lapping the liquid  some time before. I grew more anxious as the spacers around me continued to talk about the Secretary General's announcement. My ride performed its final checks before launch. I shipped out in less than a Terry  hour. I would be  running right into the region of space where most disappearances occurred. Added to this, Secretary General Kahlua an I had a lot in common--at least, the Terries and their kind would think so.

Hello, I am Captain Star Runner, the Pantheran. This is my first adventure.

Both Kahlua and I were engineered at the Institute of Androgyns, Kahlua for the diplomatic corps. Me. I am a star runner, designed to be what Terries call an astrogator. . To the Terry way of thinking, we are freaks. They look upon us with suspicion and usually give us a wide birth.

So you may think it is strange that I would be drinking a Terry drink in a Terry bar on a Terry space station outside the borders of the Coalition. No one spoke to me. No one looked in my direction as they grumbled against Coalition policies in general and the just-announced interdiction in particular.

I looked at my drink again. What would a terry spacer do? Could I just shove the container and its contents into the recycler?
Would Kirk Langley find my behavior unacceptable? previously He had explained to me that I needed to order something to sit in his bar. I sat in his bar to learn about the spacer trade. I was a neophyte then. My Featherote mentor insisted I mingle with the other spacers. "Listen to their chatter," he said. "You will learn many useful things: what is being traded on distant worlds, what kinds of repair parts are best for your star drive, who deals fairly and who cheats. Who has the best food to eat on a given station and who has the cheapest docking fees." I quickly learned spacers talked about these items, often contradicting one another, politics and a great deal of chatter that made little or no sense to me.

The Terry spacers continued to talk among themselves. Apparently, they had forgotten I was in the bar or they did not care. I felt very much alone, a feeling which troubled me more and more the more time I spent among terries.

I finished my bubbly drink, shoved the container into the recycler and extricated myself from the contraption Terries call a chair.

"Hey, Star," one of the spacer called over to me. "We don't mean you when we're talking about the cats. It's nothing personal between us and you. You know that, don't you?"

Did I? Thus far, the spacers I have encountered here at the bar bear me no particular ill will. I think they have become used to my comings and goings.

I replied, "I understand."

"Are you shipping out?"

I hesitated. The spacers had never before asked me a question like this. Should I tell them? If I did not tell them, they would not be able to sit here at Kirk Langley’s bar and wonder if I would be overdue. Maybe that was the point of the exercise.

"In," I queried my ship in my head, "twenty-seven of your minutes."

"Where are you going?"

"A rendezvous outside the Sacred Worlds," I answered.

"Close to the border."

"Too close to the border," I growled.

"When do you expect to return?"

Again I hesitated. This question was also unexpected. I was being included in the concern for outbound spacers.

I queried my ship and responded with the Terry date.

"We'll be watching for you, Captain. Take care of yourself, Star."

"Thank you."

I padded out of the bar.

Terries think of The Race as large cats. As felines are not native to our home world, some of the nuances of their comparison are lost on me. As far as I have been able to observe, the similarities are very generic: we have fur, we growl and purr. Our ears are on the top of our heads and we can swivel them. We also have tails. For reasons lost in genetic history, star runners are blessed with very long and full tails which we use to great effect when making entrances or exits.

I stand over six feet tall at the shoulder. I am well-muscled, with fuchsia-colored fur. I have a splash of white fur on my forehead. The norm is to be pastel-colored with no contrasting fur. I have always considered my white patch unfortunate and an embarrassment. The Terries tell me it is in the shape of a star which I find confusing. However, Terries have found it amusing since I am a star runner. They call me Star Runner and for their convenience, I call my little ship that, too. The Race uses unique numbers for each of its androgyns and spacecraft which is much more efficient. I have also observed that shortening names is a sign of comradery among Terries. Being called Star rather than Star Runner might be significant. I would have to ponder all this on my way to my rendezvous near the Sacred Worlds.
I made my way through the narrow corridors of the Dirty World Space Station to the wharf where my little ship was docked. I had chosen this particular space station s my home port because of its small size and lack of terries.

At first, I had gone to a large Terry space station. The crowds, the noise, the smells were overwhelming. Terries stared at me. I found it difficult to negotiate the corridors with everyone pointing at me. I was attacked several times. The station management was slow to respond to my requests for cargo handling and ship maintenance. I was told at many establishments that they did not want me present.

I retreated to my little ship and brought a low priority cargo to Dirty World Station. The station manager was courteous. The shipyard recommended several repairs and performed them efficiently and at a reasonable cost. I received a better cargo bound for the Sacred Worlds. I found my niche in frontier shipping. I could deliver a small cargo more quickly than most Terries. I transport stolen goods and illegal goods--no questions asked. Sometimes an entity doing this sort of business is called a smuggler. Sometimes it is called a gun runner. Gunrunner appeals to me because I am a star runner. My transactions are confidential and quick. Dirty World Station serves me well as no one comes to the Dirty World Star System for pleasure. Serious spacers, often with questionable cargos, frequent the space station, no questions asked. Unlike some other ports on the Northern Frontier, the space station itself is reputable. They do not ask. We do not tell.

Chapter 2: Rendezvous

Dirty World Station handled a great many spaceships. It also had a ship repair facility. I had chosen it as my home port because the Featherote Charm had recommended it to me when they outfitted my little ship. Although my ship is classified as a sloop, that classification is generous. It is mostly a freighter with a living space for me. However, freighters require certain documents and certifications which I lack since they are deemed to be commercial vessels. A sloop, on the other hand, can be considered a personal vessel. As such, there are few requirements especially here on the Northern Frontier and even more especially on Dirty World Station.

I had learned the Terry custom of words having more than one meaning. Dirty World was named for its dust storms which made everything they touched dirty. The space station had taken its name from the planet. However, dirty could also mean corrupt, acquired by improper mens or unethical and squalid. This basicly summed up Dirty World Station.

This said, the workers and retail establishments on Dirty World Station were not corrupt nor was the station management. In that sense, they ran a clean staDirty referred to the cargos which came in and out of the space station. Pirates, smugglers and gun runners used Dirty World Station for its dependable services. You also did not have to guard particularly against bodily harm as was true on other stations. It was, I thought, as I trotted quickly toward my little ship, a very odd combination.tion.
 It felt good to get aboard Ship. The cargo was loaded, the flight plan filed. We were ready to launch.

I strapped into my acceleration web. As odd as Humans think this is, Ship activated that part of my brain responsible for orgasm. For reasons totally unknown to all but the genetic engineers, this caused me to void and position my body in the web to maximize my body's ability to withstand the G-forces necessary to leave the solar system before jump. Not surprisingly, all the connections of the web fit me perfectly. We had been designed for each other. he orgasm just happened to be a pleasure able side effect of flight preparation. When I was in position, Ship initiated launch. When we were clear of the station, we accelerated quickly, more quickly than any human ship manage.

The keely class of ship are the fastest personal freighters in explored space. The only ones who can fly them are Runners.

When we were outside the system, we engaged our own jump engines for the Syria system. The Dirty Star gate cannot get us directly there and in the cargo business, the human expression holds true: Time is Money.

yes, Runners are profit-oriented. We love our toys--the latest ships, the latest computers,  the best materials for our hobbies, the best food and drink we can afford.

When we came out of our jump at Syria I thought:

"All systems stop."

"Acknowledged."

"sensor scan."

"In progress."

"Anything?"

"Wait."

I waited. My instructions to rendezvous for my cargo were not that unusual. Space stations are leaky places. There are lots of eyes, lots of questions, lots of information that needs to be given. A private rendezvous like this meant privacy. It also meant that what I was probably being asked to transport was stolen goods or goods the trader or the recipient was not supposed to have. High risk means high profit.

An unmarked vessel was coming toward our coordinates Unmarked vessels are not that rare. People do not like to advertise their presence especially outside the border. Inside the border, turning off your transponder is illegal and can result in impoundment and loss of your operator's license.

I waited. There was no hail. Was this my contact or someone else. My transponder continued to broadcast my identity on all known hailing frequencies.

As the ship approached and continued its radio silence, my anxiety increased. My tail began to twitch. My whiskers quivered. My nostrils flared. Who was this and why weren't they hailing me?

"Be ready to jump," I thought.

"Acknowledged."

"Be ready to defend also but do not arm any weapons."

"Acknowledged."

Ship in my head, feeding me its sensor data in pictures,, numbers and graphs gave me the the assurance of I could handle any contingency. My bladder filled.

"Restore cafiter functions."

"Acknowledge."

I couldn't be bothered by bodily needs and reactions at this point.

I inhaled deeply. Only the smell of Ship and me. I couldn't that other ship with thousands of kokos of space between us.

"Another ship."

"Show me."

The pictures in my changed. The trader had arrived, scorch marks on its hull and apparently otherwise in tact.

"Star Runner." the trader's voice, or simulated voice, drew out runner. Not a human speaker. Not one of The Race either, but then, I hadn't expected that, not out here.

"Acknowledged."

"Are you ready to transfer?"

I hesitated.

"Whose our friend?" I queried, using the human vernacular.

"The unidentified vessel? I didn't think this of you, Star Runner. Are you becoming human?"

I growled. "Who is the unidentified ship?" I queried again.

"Unknown."

I considered. As I weighed the pros and cons, Ship flashed up probabilities. The unidentified had continued to close but had not displayed any hostile intentions beyond its lack of a transponder signal. It was not carrying external weapons. The trader was close at hand. If the transfer was straightforward, I could be away quickly.

"Rendezvous coordinates."

"Acknowledged."

The docking tunnel deployed, the cargo transferred, its destination received, partial payment received, my bond given.

"Six de-cloaking"

"I see."

We were surrounded.

"Powering weapons."

"Jump!"

"Jump not calculated."

Sometimes Ship could be so literal-minded. We were about to be attacked and we were no match for those ships!

"Previous defined jump." I had told Ship to be prepared to jump. I hadn't said where.
"Acknowledged."

We jumped with energy weapons discharging all around us. We were hit, more than once. I blacked out as Ship absorbed the discharges.


Chapter 3

I came to to hear Ship in station keeping mode.

"Report." My thoughts sounded foggy even to me.

"78% of starboard sensors off-line," Ship reported. "Damage report follows."

The report started scrolling before my eyes.

"Stop report." My brain couldn't focus on words and figures with schematics.

"Where are we?"

"Unknown."

"Unknown?" I started to get up but my acceleration web held me stationary. We were still at zero G.

"The system in which we are located does not match any known star."

Ship waited for me to absorb this information. Its artificial intelligence had a basic understanding of how quickly The Race reacts to unexpected or troubling information.

"Where are we within the system?"

"Where we entered it."

"How long ago?"" How long had I been out.

"17 kas."

Not long.

"Scans?"

"Limited due to damage."

"Report."

I saw the system in 3-D: a yellow star, seven planets, two asteroid belts. Nothing remarkable.

"Inhabited."

"no sign of higher life."

"Inhabitable planets?"

"47.7%."

Another graph. The planets were too hot or too cold to comfortably support intelligent life as we knew it.

"Take up a defensive position. Standard acceleration. Can I suit up and start repairing sensors?"

"Standby."

HUMPH. Standby. Wrapped in an acceleration in zero G there was no way to stand. I tingled. Ship was medicating me, fortifying me. The web unwrapped itself and I floated free. I snagged a climbing bar with my left back leg. Judiciously, as always in zero-g, I got my forepaws into position and using my back legs to push off, made my way toward the starboard hatch. I suited up, fastened safety lines, and cycled out of the lock onto the hull.

One of my first assignment as a juvenile runner was ship repair. I had learned early how to both stay attached to the hull with magnetic booties and how to launch myself from one location to another with relative ease and a high degree of accuracy and safety. Carrying my repair kit felt surprisingly reassuring.

From my vantage point on the starboard hull, I could see the scorch marks. I growled my displeasure. I liked my ship shiny and unmarred. There was no help for it of course. Ships got
all sorts of marks on them because of moving at high velocity in space. Maybe I could maintain the scorch marks as some badge of courage though I had dashed to get out of the firing range as quickly as possible.

It took Ship three days to take up position in the shadow of one of the outer moons of one of the outer planets. There was no point going anywhere until I had Ship's sensors working properly. after that, I could see what could be done about the other repairs. I worked until Ship told me to come in. I ate what Ship told me to eat. I drank what Ship told me to drink. I slept when Ship told me to strap myself into the acceleration web where it was easier for Ship to monitor my health and administer drugs including a sleeping potient.

I healed. I healed Ship with the supplies I had on board. Ship analyzed the star field in view.

None of the constellations looked familiar to me either from the star charts or from my limited stargazing as a kitten. Wherever we were, we were a long way from where we had started. Our logs did not give us any information. The coordinates we had used would have taken us to our proposed destination but they hadn't.

That was Ship's analysis. But Ship did not take the trader into account. had these been the exact coordinates where we had gone?

The problem with jump coordinates is their complexity. No ordinary spacecraft can calculate all the parameters. You need a military vessel or one with much more computing power than I could afford. If the jump coordinates were in your almanac, you could execute them. If someone gave them to you, you could execute them. So you were dependent on your source to give you reliable jump coordinates. Apparently, we had been given bogus ones. Why?

And how were we going to get out of this mess?

We began the laborious progress of moving from star to star under our own power. We utilized solar energy to maintain our power supply, converting energy into matter in very small amounts when needed to maintain me. I continued to work on the ship when we weren't under high acceleration.

It took six months, but in time, Ship identified a star on our charts and we had the jump coordinates to return to Dirty World Crossroads.

I had many questions chief among them:

* Who was the trader who had given me bad coordinates?
* Why?
* Who were the ships that fired upon me?
* Why?
* What would I be walking into when I returned to the station?
* And what would become of the munitions I had in my hold?

Because you see, I had checked, there were contraband munitions in my hold. Thankfully, nobody would ask any questions at DWC. It was, after all, a dirty world, one that didn't ask many questions of those who came and went at its station outside Coalition borders.

And the more I pondered what had happened, the more uneasy I became. it is easy to become paranoia when you don't see any other intelligent being for months on end, but it is another thing to find oneself lost after having spent time on a human station.

Who had been in the cafe? Who knew where I was going? I went over those questions over and over again in my mind and did not come up with any good answers though I had the nagging feeling the answers were there if I could think about them differently.



Chapter 4

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo walked into the cafe fifteen minutes after  I sat down at one of the tables with my first non-shipboard meal in six months. Although crunchies were nutritious, easy-to-eat and provided all the nutrition any of The Race  needed, I am known to enjoy my food and like many other runners, to enjoy sampling foods from other races.

"Welcome back," Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo said as she slid, uninvited, into the chair opposite me

I did not answer her but kept eating, pausing to lick my whiskers, my chin and my fingers as I ate.

"We need to talk," Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo  whispered, knowing I, with my superior hearing, could hear her. "I'm investigating."

I ignored her. I was hungry and her conspiratorial manner needed to be explained. I was suspicious of all humans after my sojourn in unknown space. I finished eating, shoved the tray into the recycler and stood up, stretching from my cramped position on the chair, reaching paws high over my head, extending my claws, rising on my back toes. Then I folded my arms across my chest and waited, letting Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo know I heard her all right.

"I don't have an office here on the station," Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo said just as quietly as she had spoken before. "We'll have to go to my ship to speak privately.

I didn't move. I didn't blink. I didn't give Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo any indication I had heard.I certainly didn't want to go onto Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo  ship. I only met humans face-to-face in public places. Besides, the smell would be terrible.

"I'm with a consortium," Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo said. "We've gotten together to deal with some of the commercial issues."

I still didn't move. I had not heard of this consortium and I wanted to know more. I turned my ears toward her to ndicate I was still listening.

"We're concerned. Our ships are disappearing. Our people are being lost. I thought you might be able to share with me what happened to you."

"I was given jump coordinates that weren't on my charts," I said. "It took me six months to find a star on my charts and to calculate my jump here. I have the latest star charts. I pay a premium for them."

"Would you be willing to look at some pictures', see if you recognized anyone?"

"the subtleties of human physiognomy escape me," I responded. "I can't help you with pictures." They would be stills, harder to see than moving images. Humans liked things that way, still. I had difficulty seeing anything that way. All text scrolled in my head at the rate I could absorb it.

"You don't trust me," Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo said.

"No."

"How can I win your trust?"

"Show me I can trust you," I said and with that, I left the cafe and went back to my ship.

I had lost valuable time and supplies searching for the way out of my dilemma. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who had been sent astray. Perhaps I was the only one who had made it back so far. All the rest of the ships were overdue and feared lost. Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo needed me. I doubted I needed to be seen in her company right now. I still had a business to run and I had lost valuable time and contacts.

I've heard of Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo. She gets to the bottom of things. She worked for human intelligence for a wile and for a number of the business conglomerates. She probably doesn't realize I know who she is. She is the right human pronoun, isn't it? She has those bumps on her chest which are human mammaries I wonder how she would nurse a litter, that is, if humans have litters. I don't know if they do. I don't really care if they do. I don't know much else about Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo except that she's good at what she does, she's persistent and she's ruthless. Who is in this Consortium? I've never heard of it. is it new? Formed because of these disappearances?

I put Ship to work, going over communicates, sifting, searching, getting me up-to-date information now that we were back. There was also the problem of the munitions. I needed to be paid and the only way to be paid was to deliver these goods. I would prefer to deliver them to their intended recipient though, to get them out of my hold, I'd deliver them to anyone with money.

Ship came up with the information I needed by next station cycle.

The consortium was made up of planetary governing councils, and business firms doing business here on the southern frontier--all human. There were few of The Race operating out here independently though perhaps some of the conglomerates had pantheran participants.

The next time she approached me, and Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo would approach me again, I Would dain to speak with her though how much I would tell her I still didn't know. I suspected it wouldn't be much. I wanted her to tell me things. My priority was work. An idle runner was a
hungry runner.

	I didn't get the chance to decide how much I would say to Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo. I had set Ship several tasks:

1.. Review all messages logged to my remote teleservice during my absence.
2. Review my contract for the munitions transaction to determine my liability and theirs.
3. If possible, locate a buyer.
4. Identify other jobs.

When I returned to Ship, I learned I was free to resell the munitions and that, if I was able, to could entitled to damages and full payment. The jump coordinates had placed in my ship and me in unacceptable risk without warning me ahead of time. I put the wheels in motion to file a claim. Meanwhile, several offers of work were still negotiable. I was able to piggyback them and plan a zigzag route across the frontier to receive and deliver.

In my absence, the demand for munitions had escalated. It would seem that many parties were anxious to stockpile whatever military hardware they could lay hands. Some kind of border war was brewing. All the ramifications were lost on me. I am, after all, just a simple gunrunner with no loyalties. So far, all the combatants have understood this. I don't know how much longer my neutrality will be respected. As a result, I tripled my prices and all my partners agreed to pay the price. They all seemed very desperate for supplies and their desperation is my gain.

I had Ship run all contracts through LegalAdvisor. Changes were made--changes all parties accepted albeit grudgingly. I got paid if I delivered. I got paid if I got injured or my Ship was fired upon. My damages were covered. If I was lied to, I could resell their property how, when where and to whom I chose. The bargains were hard. The stakes were high. My life and my ship were on the line.

My tail twitched with anticipation. Danger was my rush. I could do this.I am, after all, a hunter by heritage and by birthright

We launched three hours after I left the cafe.


Chapter 5

[some descriptions of Star's exploits while away may go here.]


Chapter 6

When I walked into the cafe, Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo was already sitting in the cafe with a drink in front of her. The chair opposite her was empty. She was sitting away from the other spacers. her back was to the door. Apparently, she was pretending she wasn't waiting for me. Maybe she wasn't, but I doubted that.

I went to the counter, ordered, waited for my coffee mocha with whipped cream and chocolate jimmies to be prepared and carried it over to her table. I settled myself in the chair opposite her, not an easy business. Humans don't have tails and insist on having backs on their chairs instead of using stools.

You wanted to talk to me? I said.

You don't miss a beat, do you, Captain Star Runner?

A beat?

You've been gone for eight months and you walk in here as if we had talked yesterday.

I don't understand. I thought you wanted to talk to me.

Yes, I do. I just wasn't expecting you to dock, walk in here and pick up the thread of our conversation so quickly.

My food arrived. I started eating. Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo watched me intensely.

Something wrong? I asked when I had eaten all my food and  I drank some of my coffee. The whipped cream and jimmies had melted into the coffee.

You are eating as if you haven't eaten in a while.

I turned one ear toward her in question. I have eaten regularly, I said. All my nutritional needs have been met.

I thought cats were picky eaters.

Cats?

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo took a swallow of her drink. this caused some of her lipstick to ad hear to the cup. I have learned this means she will need to reapply the color. I believe female humans use such color to attract sexual partners. I wondered if Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo had a sexual partner on Dirty World Station.

There is an arms build up going on out here on the frontier, she began.

I waited. I believed she was correct. I had been transporting some very expensive, very powerful, very scarce munitions these past eight months.

I don't know who. I don't know why and I don't know why so many ships are disappearing Can you shed any light on this?

I licked my paw and began washing my mouth, thinking. I had a whole database of names, financial transactions, coordinates. I couldn't share them with Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo.

The suppliers and recipients of cargos I transport wish to remain anonymous, I said, wiping salsa off my whiskers. I licked my paw again and rubbed my cheek. I think that many of the parties with whom I have dealings are not the sources of the items nor are they the ones who are the final buyers. I am contracting with brokers, simply providing transportation.

And making the goods untraceable.

I raised an eyebrow, rubbing hard at a particular spot underneath my eye. I licked carefully again, rubbed languidly, giving my paws something to do. I have observed that humans do not wash in public like this. Maybe this would distract Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo.

I assure my clients privacy. They pay me well for it. Without it ... I shrugged

You would be out of business.

Yes.

Would you characterize any of your business associates as pirates?

Pirates. Humans with a patch over one eye. Was that right?

I am not sure what you mean by pirate. I cannot tell you if they have both eyes uncovered.

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo looked confused, then laughed, a very musical sound. Not all pirates, Captain Star, have a patch over one eye and a wooden leg.

But, I said, dead men tell no tales.

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo sobered immediately. That is also true. You have an interesting grasp
of human language and customs, Captain Star Runner. A pirate is a thief.

I continued washing my face. I had never asked myself where the munitions came from. Thievery was a serious offense in the Coalition. Even here on the Frontier, Coalition sensibilities usually prevailed. Human were less worried about theft than The Race, but, at the same time, they did not take theft lightly. I had schooled myself not to think about it. Much of what I was paid well to transport was contraban and much of it must be stolen. I wasn't the thief so it didn't matter to me as long as I got paid what I asked.

You believe the weapons you are trying to trace are stolen.

Yes, we do.

That "we" again. The Consortium no doubt. I didn't believe for one minute that the Consortium was a benign organization. I carefully licked each paw, waiting. I think humans call this a game of cat and mouse. Would she give me more information? I was beginning to be very certain I needed as much information as Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo, her consortium and the so-called pirates as I could gather in order to continue to survive here on the frontier. There reallly wasn't any place else for me to go.

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo placed her empty cup carefully into the recycler, being deliberate, taking her time.

Do you know if the weapons you have been transporting are military surplus ? she asked very quietly.

Military! Surplus! The words stung me.

The growl had escaped my throat unbidden before I jumped to my feet, unmindful of the chair which clattered noisily to the floor. I bounded out of the cafe, running as fast as I could on two feet because humans discourage The Race from running on all fours on their stations.

What's with it? I heard a spacer ask.

I don't know, Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo replied, but I intend to find out.

When I got to the space way connecting my ship to the station though, I leaped onto it, letting my front paws touch my metallic surface. Several leaps and I was inside my ship. The hold was open and the automated cargo unloaders were preparing to remove my cargo. I jumped to the upper deck where my living space was. There are no stairs, no ladders. A human is not able to jump this high. It discourages them from coming aboard when the ship is open for cargo transfer. I can watch from above if necessary. Ship can monitor and contact me immediately if I am away from the ship.

I needed to calm down, to process what Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo had told me--and not told me.

Captain Star Runner!

I heard Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo voice from the entryway.

Permission to come aboard.

I padded back to the edge of the deck. In my own slip, I often did not stand. I liked the primeval feel of moving around this way. I had also found it unnerved many humans. I didn't have to puff up to intimidate many of them, just look down at them from the upper deck, resting comfortably on my forepaws.

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo stepped back.

You are magnificent, she said. I heard a tremor in her voice.

I didn't understand what she meant. I simply waited. What did she want with me.

I don't know why you. won't speak with me. I just thought you might be able to characterize your cargo.

I knew she meant the munitions though I hadn't said I transported any.

These are supplies for Dirty World, I said as the cartons on their carriers moved onto the space way. I believe they are textiles: clothing and items to cover the feet for warmth. There are factories on New Bravo.

You are avoiding my questions.

I am not under any obligation to answer your questions.

You are a survivor, Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo said. I want to know how your survive out there.

By not telling people like you, nameless and faceless people of your Consortium, anything.

I swished my tail. I wanted her gone, but technically, she was not on my ship. She was standing in the space way and I could not close the hatch until my ship was unloaded.

We'll talk again, Captain Gillie  Romeres Lujo finally said. She returned to the station.




Chapter 7

I paced my lair, deciding what to do. I found using the Dirty World Station convenient for my operations. It was near the border. It was a convenient jump to several systems where I did business frequently. It had a good shipyard for repairs and there wasn't a lot of what the humans call red tape. They didn't ask questions. The food at the cafe was good. The spacers kept to themselves mostly and did not involve themselves in my affairs. There were no restrictions on my movements. But Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo and her questions ... I wanted information not just questions. And what had she meant by calling me magnificent?

My mind made up, I issued Ship instructions:

1. Update me on the Consortium and its activities.
2. Give me everything it could find on Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo.
3. Get repaired as quickly as possible. Another human word. I liked the crisp sound of it.
4. Set up the most lucrative contracts
5. Monitor any of Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo's communications.

This last was now possible. one of my contracts had been paid with state of the art surveillance equipment. This would give me a chance to use it and evaluate my results.ASAP.

I am a hunter from a race of hunters. This is my heritage. This is my birthright. The Consortium may think of me as the prey to be hunted down and questioned, to give up what they needed to know, but they would tell me what I wanted to know and the best part, they would not even know they were doing it.

I left the details of the surveillance to Ship. My brain and Ship's computer are highly integrated. Because of my training as a runner, I can be as comfortable programming and searching Ship's databases, executing routines, processing raw data. IN some  I could do Ship’s job faster because my brain could make connections Ship’s artificial intelligence could not. Usually, though, computer instructions are faster than the conscious mind. My job on shipboard is to think,, to reason, to follow my ancestral instincts and to play my hunches.

The Race cannot roar. But if I could have, I would have.

I burned off my exuberance at my plan by exercising on all the climbing bars in the lair. When I was winded, I settled on an open shelf near the food and water dispenser to review Ship’s information.

Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo had already filed a report. My equipment had decoded it, well, mostly. There was a peculiar reference I didn’t understand:

Sylvester returned to the station. Ss engaged me but broke off conversation when I asked about theft and military sources.

Who is Sylvester I asked myself.

Ship had no relevant data.

Wider search. Human.

Nothing.

Check station databases.

Yes. Ship could get into them. Hmm. This equipment could be very useful.

Video started scrolling in my head. Human voices. One said: "I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat I did, I did see a puddy tat!" " and another lisps one said: ""Sufferin’ succotash." As I watched and listened, I saw the hapless Sylvester was  that animal humans call a cat and this cat made numerous to hunt a bird who always bested him.

Now I understood. I was the cat. Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo signed her messages TB, Tweety Bird.Restless, I jumped down and paced the lair again. If only the genetic engineers had given me a male's voice. I could roar. How dare this Consortium shame me like this.

Ship gave me more video. Ship had hacked into Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo personal files. The time stamp on the file was very recent. The video showed the inside of her ship. She was looking straight at the camera. Obviously, she was using a monitor. It was a log file of some sort.

"I continue to be fascinated by Star Runner, the Pantheran runner. It seems odd to refer to this magnificent being as it though I suppose it is correct considering Star is a runner and all runner are neuter.


What makes Star so unique is its size and color. It is bigger than most runners I've ever seen and I've never seen one such a color. I would call is fuchsia and it has a golden patch on its shoulder which is why everyone calls it Star. I've never seen any Pantheran which natural markings. They're all solid colors, black, white or pastels. Star's color is vibrant and its tail is long. Its fur is thick all over. It makes me want to dig my hands into it. It looks so soft and silky and the way that tail swishes, I just want to run my hands all over it.

Today Star came over to talk with me, then bolted when I asked some pointed questions. What is it hiding? I went to STar's ship but I couldn't get aboard. Besides, the deck is ten or twelve feet above the space way. The only way up is to jump. I watched Star do it, effortlessly. Nothing sparse about this cat. Even its whiskers are luxurious. It seems somehow a shame hat it is an it.

I asked to analyze the text, the tone and the facial expressions. Maybe learning to read human expressions better would be helpful. I had resisted doing that. It is more work because I
 would HAVE TO Enhance my receptors with sensor data.



After aI fed, watered and litter panned myself, Ship showed me its analysis. Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo's expression was called wistful. It meant sad. What was she sad about, not being able to get up into my lair? What did all this description of me mean? I queried the databases again, adding the word magnificent. The ;matches was less certain but melancholy tinged with sexual longing was the best explanation.

I thought about the lipstick on Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo cup. She was exhibiting sexual behavior in the cafe. Did that extend to me?

Disgusting, I thought. Revolting. Copulation between The Race and humans was physically possible though not satisfying to either party from the reports I read. Males ripped female humans' vaginas with their barbed penises. Male humans could not be sufficiently aroused inside the larger female unless they bulked up their penises with layers of coverings. Cross breeding was impossible without genetic engineering which had not been attempted. The humans didn't have the skill. The Race's genetic engineers refused to dilute The Race in this way.

Whatever Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo desired, we could not come together sexually.

Barbed pricks! I thought. It would be disgusting to have a human touch me the way she had described in her log. A desire for physical contact had been rooted out of my genetic profile. Runners were solitary beings. I frequented the human cafes for stimulation, not to be malled by a sex-driven female. She would do better to shove her ass at one of the spacers.

I shuddered again. Touching my tail. Never! I would be very, very careful around Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo in future.

The overhaul on Ship's engines began at midnight local time. The station would be dark. The humans would be asleep. I prowled about, listening to the bots working, following their reports.

You need to sleep. Ship advised.

Not yet.

Yes. Strap into the web. I will adjust your levels, give you a very mild sedative. If necessary, which is unlikely, I will give you a stimulant if you need to be awakened.

I strapped in. Ship flooded my brain with colors patterns, swirling patterns of pastel colors accompanied by the sounds of the forest on my home world. The web began massaging my muscles, relaxing my limbs, my spine, rubbing the pads of my paws. I began to pur as the tension left my body, the constant pressure on selected my pressure points calming me. When I no longer twitched with pent up tension and energy, Ship began arousing me. The web rocked as I moved with the stimulation. When I climaxed Ship cleansed my blood stream of the hormones it had previously inserted, replacing them with a sedative. I slept for many hours. My dreams, which Ship both monitored and directed when necessary, were of the hunt. I was running across one of the savannas of a bygone era, the prey running ahead of me, already worn out by previous runners. I was given the glory of the kill. I jumped on the animal's back, driving it to the ground, cutting its throat in one quick slice. I stood astride it, paws upraised as my hunting companions gathered around me. We sang a joyous song of the successful hunt and I was given the honor of the first portion, warm, juicy, delicious.


These were, of course, implanted memories. This was our birthright though The Race no longer hunted in this way. The prey was not domestic livestock. The savannas had been turned into cities. But before they were gone, The Race had decided we all would have these memories encoded in our DNA. Even the androgynous members of The Race were be allowed to dream of the hunt.

Although the information is buried deep inside The Race's archives, I had learned that my memories were different from the average runner, from even the males. No one had intended for me to have them. It was an accident of genetics, an unintended consequence of a random combination of recessive genes. If The Ruling Pride had known, they would have ordered my termination immediately. But the genetic engineers had been both startled and delighted. Sometimes it happened. Sometimes in their labs a unique kitten was born. They may have been scientists, but they also had reverence for the old ways. My color and my unusual yellow patch marked as a special being. The old legends told of such beings. The old ballads commemorated our great deeds of old. I had memorized every one of them. In the end, though, my heritage had been denied me. I had been turned out. Now I was out here on the border, outside of Coalition space indefinitely. I had become a gunrunner and with my new surveillance equipment, an outlaw. I didn't know any ballads about outlaws. I would have to research them.

I stretched luxuriously in the web. All my bodily needs were being taken care of. I knew from the dreamy state I was in Ship was continuing to medicate me. My body was being prepared for another round of accelerations, jumps, negotiations and maybe even dangers. I purred contentedly, had another orgasm and went back to sleep.


Chapter 8

"I haven't seen Star Runner for three days," Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo was telling her log. "Repairs are continuing on its ship. It's locked down tight. It hasn't returned any messages. In fact, they haven't even been acknowledged. I would think something was wrong except that the station engineers tell me the ship is communicating properly with the engineering teamand its bots. They tell me Star's ship would let them know if Star needed anything.

I didn't think Star was the scarety cat type. I don't know what I said to cause it to hide like this.

I laughed. I am not hiding from you, silly human female. I am becoming strong. You do not want to engage a hunter like me.

I finished reviewing all the material Ship had found on both Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo and the Consortium.

The Consortium was fond of words like "legitimate," "fair use",and "accept business practices." They had an aversion to those who did not pay import and export taxes and positively dispised smugglers. Well, then, we did not have much common cause. The interest of the Consortium seem categorically opposed to my modis operandi. I believe in what I think the humans call lezefare economics.

The Consortium had hired Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo to identify smugglers and to shut down all so-called illegitimate shipping channels. That meant me.

The questions that remained unanswered were these:

1. Why this sudden interest in shutting down smugglers?
2. What did any of this have to do with the Coalition interdiction?
3. What did all this have to do with the ongoing attacks and disappearances?

More research.

The Consortium wanted to root out the smugglers and establish controlled commerce so that the interests they represented could apply for and be accepted to Coalition membership. In effect, by letting these worlds intothe Coalition, the frontier would cease to exist. The border would be moved farther South to less developed worlds. The shift, of course, was probably inevitable. Colonists would settle a world, move from substance economics to a profit-centered economy and desire the perks Coalition membership gave them: taxes, regular passenger service between worlds, rights and responsibilities. Those wanted a less regulated life style would relocate to a new world. They called it civilation.

At some level, I could be called a product of civilization, being an engineered being. Every female on my world was required to report for fertilization when she became an adult. At the same time they became adults, each male must contribute to the spirm bank. The females had their eggs harvested, fertilized by the spirm, genetically enhanced and then reimplanted. When  the kittens were six weeks old, they were enrolled in the Institute and the female left the lab, her community service at an end. We were raised, educated and trained for specific roles in our society. If we did not fit them, we were declared serplus. Being declared serplus meant society would no longer support us. We were scheduled for termination. We could surrender voluntarily, find a position to sustain us--usually a day laborer or household servant--or strike out on our own. I had been declared serplus which had not surprised me. I was prepared from an early age for that designation. I had developed several ways to have some money on hand and moved quickly to place myself physically far away from my home world. The frontier was an excellent location. I piloted other people's ships until I could finance my own first freighter. I had been upgrading ever since, building a reputation, taking risks. The bigger the risks, the bigger the contract. The bigger the contract, the more profit, the better the shipk, the better the opportunity that someday I could call one of those extreme frontier worlds home. I wasn't there yet. Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo and her Consortium was getting in my way.


Chapter 9

When I was a juvenile, I had the great fortune to have a senior genetic engineer befriend me. I say this indivudual was a genetic engineer because he worked at the Institute. Not all the the individuals who worked there were engineers specifically though that is what we called them because we were young and our days were filled with all the things we needed to learn before becoming adults. Androgynous members of The Race mature much more quickly. There is little time for idleness and extracurricular pursuits. Those who indulge themselves get poor assignments and run two significant risks:

1. Not making the grade and being declared serplus.
2. Making the grade barely and pulling poor assignments.

My benefactor, properly speaking, was the archivist. He kept records. he watched for trends, problems with the genetic enhancements, making sure the angrogyns produced were up to the Institute's high standards. Lab techs could become sloppy. Inferrior fertilizations could be implanted. His passion though was The Race's history. It was he who saved me from termination at birth. Fuchsia-colored kittens were extremely rare. If the Institute overseers had known the history about my predeccors, they would have lined up to administer the lethal drugs themselves.

The archivist could not tell me the last time a fuchsia androgyn had been born. That information had been expongued from his records by a previous archivist. He could, however, tell me the legends and why the governors were would be so  worried when they found out.

In days of old, on certain nights when the night was very dark--no moons shone, the star were obscured from view--a kitten was born who would have fuchsia-colored fur. Even more rare than fuschia fur was a golden patch on the kitten's left shoulder. Such a kitten would grow to be a great hunter, running faster with more kills to its name. It was brave and smart and it always walked alone. In those distant days, there were no androgyns. Despite its sex, it was highly respected for its hunting prowess and it always walked alone. Songs were sung about the exploits of this great ones.

So far, their appearance doesn't sound threatening. They sound like a great asset to the pride. However, their coming always meant danger for The Race was close at hand. A great champion would be needed to put The Race back on track, to keep The Race from annihilation or to relieve great hardship.

These Sunmarked oness--the yellow patch--confronted monarchs. They toppled the rich and undid their oppressive schemes. They set captives free. They turned the world upside down. The Race recovered from these interventions and became stronger. However, those who were displaced were never happy. They were the ones with power and presteige. The birth of a fuschia-colored, sun-marked kitten meant the world as The Race knew it was about to change. One of my sun-marked ancestors had initiated space travel. Another had predicted The Race would work with other races. A third had founded the genetic enhancement program to enhance all members of The Race.


I don't expect to do anythng lke ths. I am just tryng to survive. I am now an offworlder, living outsde Coaltion space, coming and gong mostly here on the frontier. Some call me a gun runner. Others say I am a smuggler. I am far from my kind, f I can be sad to have a knd. And now I have Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo and the Consortium to deal wth. They are,  have come to beleve, tryng to compromise my business and use me for ther own ends. I cannot let this happen. I must remain free.


Chapter 10

I pick up. I deliver. The call that came in as I pondered my next move ratchetted my involvement in the movement of munitions up a notch.

"I have need," the caller said, "of some very specific items. Can you provide them?"

The source of the transmission was hidden, audio only.

"Perhaps," I said. "It's not my usual method of operation."

"Your method of operation is well known to us," the caller continued. "We have checked you out very carefully. You come to us highly recommended for your, say we shall, discretion."

"I do not handle procurements," I said. "I transport."

"But for a price--" the caller left the end of its sentence unfinished, hanging betwen us.

My move. I could cut the transmission off. I culd refuse outright. I could agree. I could ask more questions, try to get a trace on this call. The question that had started to plauge me here at Dirty World Station: Was I being watched? Was this call being monitored? Was this call coming from the Consortium to trap me?

"I work with contracts and advances," I said. "I do not act on speculation."

"That can be arranged."

"I also require references for new clients."

"You will have them."

In my perifferal vision, the Ship displayed the references.  They had been verified. The caller was unknown to me but not to some of my best clients. Ship had independently verified their recommendations.

"If a suitable contract can be arranged," I said. "I'll see what I can do."

"That will be agreeable," my caller said. "You have two weeks."

When Ship displayed the list of supplies and the proposed contract, my whiskers quivered. heavy armaments. A tight schedule. A location for delivery where I had never been. A very generous payment schedule even given my exorbident fees.

I cleared Ship to leave Dirty World Station promptly. We could work off station as well as on and my proximity to Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo concerned me. Besides, there were other people on station who had been on station just before I was disappeared. I didn't want that to happen again.		  Ship summarized LegalAdvisor's terms and condii\tions. My brain is not configured to understand LegalAdvisor very well. In my juvenile confidence, I had once entered LegalADvisor's databanks. I became hopelessly confused and would have gone into severe shock had I not been able to use my tahought safety line to find my way back. I never went in there again. Ship's summary allowed me to simply know the information without having to read it. This has proven a more satisfactory method for staying on top of my contracts, responsibilities and rights. Ship had already located 80% of the goods. As I thought about the ocntract, that percentage rose. Clearly, I hadn't been given hard things to find. A test then. The first shipments were to be easy. The contract had been so structured that I could deliver without finding and delivering everything. There were so nice-to-have-it-you-can-find-it items. I received a premiumif I could locate them, of course, ut I would not be penalized.

One of the quirky provisions of the contract was that I personally deliver the items by appearing on Pirate's Cove in the manager's office. The coordinates would be given in me when I had procured the required items. Well, so be it. I would be compensated.

We jumped when our procurement was at 97.79%.
