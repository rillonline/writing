## I Meet Kearsarge

People are lining up outside the Galactic Diner, waiting for a table inside. I am shocked. I have never seen the restaurant so busy. The people are dressed in sporting clothes--I mean they look like cyclists, runners, equestrians, space travelers from a bygone era. What is this?

Then I remember. The League of the Solar Planets Olympics is about to begin in Ptolemy City. Fans always dress as participants for their favorite events.

"Well," I thought. "I will never get a seat inside. Besides, the Galactic Diner has a lot of memories for me and I am trying to put the last several years behind me. 

Well, then, where should I go for some breakfast?

I start walking along the Valley of Kings, making my way toward Lower Nile Street and the meaner streets of the city. With all these tourists in town, all the nicer places will also be overcrowded. I want an affordable restaurant and some place I can make my own.

"Detective Camberwell," someone calls.

I keep walking. I am no longer a police detective. I do not have to talk to anyone about my former life.

I hear footsteps running behind me. Reluctantly, I turn around. This person could be dangerous. This is, after all, Ptolemy City. I want to be certain. no one wants me dead. Besides, I may know them and I do not want to be rude.

"Detective Camberwell," the woman says again, running toward me.

She is a large woman. She is not dressed for the games and I have never seen her before.

"I need to speak with you," she says, coming to a stop in front of me.

She is panting though judging from my brief observation of her running, she is used to working out. She is not graceful. She is powerful and well muscled. Personally, I like my women more delicate and fluid, but damn!! I find her quite attractive.

"I am not a detective," I say. "I haven't been on the force in years. I am afraid I can't help you with any legal matters."

"I know you're not a detective any more," the woman says. "I just didn't know what else to call you. I need to speak with you. Can we go somewhere to talk."

And so my encounter with Kearsarge began.

Kearsarge, she never offered me any more identification than that, knew of a small place off Lower Nile Street. Only a few customers sat at the dozen tables and occupied a couple of stools at the counter. The woman behind the counter called  Kearsarge by name by which I deduced she was a regular. This was not brilliant detecting on my part. The woman called everyone by name. She asked me what mine was.

"Ronnie," I said.

"And what will you have, Ronnie?" the woman asked.

My second shock of the day. Here was a human being asking me for my order. No automated tables here. No menu display to tap or stare at. I located a renewable writing surface behind the woman with today's offerings. She even could serve me meat if I wanted to eat it which I did not.

Kearsarge did not order except to confirm she wanted the usual.

Kearsarge selected the table in the corner in the back where we would have relative privacy.

"What is this about?" I asked when we were seated.

Kearsarge took a long sip of her very hot coffee before speaking.

"I'm getting messages from a dead person," she said. "I want you to find out who is sending them and stop them."

"Why not just mark them as Spam and block the sender," I said.

Getting unwanted messages is a nuisance but there are easy ways not to be bothered by them. Every child knows how to do this. Kearsarge hardly needed to chase me down the street and bring me to her regular eating establishment to ask me about this.

"I tried," Kearsarge said. "I couldn't stop them."

I sipped my tea. For a nondescript place, they brewed a wicked cup of tea.

"There's more to this story," I finally said.

"Yes,' Kearsarge said. "That's why I want to hire you."

"Hire me?" I asked.

"Yes," Kearsarge said. "I wouldn't expect you to work for free. You are an investigator, right?"

"I didn't think so," I said.

"Troy Camberwell said you were a good investigator." Kearsarge persisted.

Thanks, Dad.

"Yes," I replied with a great deal of caution. "I am. But I'm not on the police force any more."

Our food arrived and for a time we sat in silence eating. The food was excellent. I hoped it would not be awkward for me to come here again.

"I really need your help," Kearsarge said after our plates were cleared and we each had a fresh cup before us to drink. "I'm scared."

I saw how her hands trembled as she picked up her coffee cup to drink. Being a large woman with a lot of confidence her admission surprised me. Perhaps I had allowed her size and assured manner in approaching a stranger and conducting her to her favorite eating establishment to deceive me.

"Scared of what?" I asked. Damn! My old instincts to protect and defend the weak and defenseless came to the forefront of my mind.

"The dead man is my husband," Kearsarge said. She looked away. "He was violent."

"And now he's dead," I said.

"That's right," Kearsarge said.

"You're certain about this?"

Death was a fluid thing in Ptolemy City. You heard people were dead and then you met them on the street the next day. There was nothing miraculous in this. They were hiding from someone. They were scamming someone. They were trying to get out of a contract or collect part of the money from a contract put out on them. After all, assassination is legal here. It requires a contractual agreement, notice and an assassin. Murder, on the other hand, is another matter. In some circumstances, it can be prosecuted.

"Yes," Kearsarge said. "I had him assassinated."

"You had proof then."

"Yes. The contract was executed properly and I paid."

"But he's alive."

"No. I'm certain of that. It's just--" And here Kearsarge looked away again.

What wasn't she telling me.

"What aren't you telling me," I asked. My patience was beginning to wear thin. Protect and defend had its limits. I was being toyed with.

"There's a service," Kearsarge said, still not looking at me. "You can send messages to your loved ones after you are dead. There's nothing magical about them. You write them all before you die. You can send them on birthdays and anniversaries--that sort of thing. They're meant to be comforting. But these messages--"

And  here she visibly shivered.

"These messages are about my death--a horrible death."

Tears began to trickle down her face.

"I think it will happen--and very soon. I want you to stop it."

I refrained from answering Kearsarge right away. Clearly, she believed everything she had told me. The messages were probably real, too. I did not think Kearsarge was experiencing any remorse for her husband's death.

"I can pay you," Kearsarge said. She must have  interpreted my silence as refusal.

"Payment isn't the point," I said. "Your safety is. You need to go to a shelter."

"A shelter?"

"For victims of domestic violence."

"I can take care of myself," Kearsarge answered immediately.

"Which is it?" I asked. "You're asking me to keep you from being killed on the one hand and on the other you are claiming you can take care of yourself."

"I just want you to stop the messages," Kearsarge said. "that's all. I'm not asking you to protect me in any way."

"And you think that if I can stop the messages you'll be safe? That makes no sense."

"Yes, it does," Kearsarge insisted.

"Not to me," I said, getting to my feet. "Thank you for breakfast."

I walked out of the restaurant  without  a backward glance. I strode away, determined not to be called back.

The next time I saw Kearsarge, she was dead.

## I Receive A Contract

This did not mean, of course, that I was done with Kearsarge. A contract arrived in my queue before I stepped onto the Lake View Loop Road which circles Lake Memphis. I pushed the contract onto a reputable legal service for review. Before I entered the Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority (yes, everybody giggles at the words cooperative and authority
occupying equal space in the organization's name), the contract received a good rating with no comments attached. This meant it was quite standard in form and I should have no difficulty understanding its provisions.

My co-op is located on the top floor with a splendid view of the lake. Shepheard's Hotel is directly across from my balcony. The lake spreads out below with its boats, both real and artificial. Today it teamed with watercraft and people -- people who appeared, from my vantage point, to be busily engaged in happy pursuits. I wondered idly if any of the
aquatic Olympic events took place here and if I could watch them through binoculars.

I chose my co-op with care. From my balcony I could see the lake, the hotel and its surroundings and look through the dome above all the Tenderloin spread out above me. At night, the lurid colors of the Hypatian atmosphere are both chilling and magnificent in their
unworldliness. I say this after my travels to more earth-like planets. The colors of the Hypatian sky are both familiar and off-putting to me. I can watch them for hours.

I walked out onto the balcony, determined to make something of this day and not lie about feeling sorry for myself as I had been doing since I
arrived back on Hypatia. I would look at this contract rather than wallowing in how I screwed up my life.

It was not, thankfully, an assassination contract. I was charged to investigate the matter and provide, if possible, solutions to Kearsarge's belief that her life was in danger. If possible, I was to eliminate any and all threats. That went up to the line of assassination
without crossing it.

That was good. I could not see myself as a professional assassin. They made good money, but money was not my problem. After our breakup, I possessed a substantial bank account all carefully invested and secured. I benefited greatly from Captain Star Runner's obsession with
profitability.

I made myself comfortable, adjusting the state-of-the-art force field to let in some fresh air -- well, not fresh. The atmosphere on Hypatia is poisonous. All the air is scrubbed and recycled. Nevertheless, breathing the outside air is often preferable to the local supply in each flat.

The legal service's summary quoted the contract word for word. Kearsarge wrote in a clear and direct style. I gasped when I read the amount of the contract with thirty-five percent up front. I needed to file daily reports.

Fair enough.

What did I know about Kearsarge? Only what she had told me at the restaurant. A background check was in order before I committed myself. Perhaps she would not be able to pay me and entering into the contract would be pointless.

I sent off a query, cringing at the fee. I needed to be thorough. Something told me I would not be returning this contract unsigned. I might just as well spring for the full background check instead of doing two: a superficial one and an in depth one.

I needed to think critically about what Kearsarge had told me at the restaurant -- what was the name of that place anyway. I needed to query my rather ostentatious link. Like all the latest and fashionable ones, it presented a flower. I activated it with a glance.

"The name of the restaurant off Lower Nile Street -- on Elwood Street, I think."

"The Elwood Street Diner," the Link responded. A picture appeared in my visual field. That was it.

"File for future reference," I said aloud. I was alone. Forming the thought pattern to save this information required more finesse than I commanded at this early stage of use. I wondered how Star managed doing this all the time. It gave me a blinding headache. The verbal commands
were so much easier and less stressful.

There. I did it again, comparing my current life with Star's. Star was out of my life. For all I knew, Star was out of the western galactic arm by now -- a very long ways away.

I sighed. It was good while it was good. When it stopped being good, it was, well, excruciatingly painful. I told myself then and I continue to tell myself now that I am still in love with my memory of Star at the beginning of our relationship not with the reality of our relationship
at the end. But I digress from this story about Kearsarge.

What had she told me?

1. She was receiving messages from her dead husband. No, that isn't right. She was receiving messages sent in her dead husband's name.

2. These messages concerned her death -- a horrible death which frightened her very much. I did not know the contents of these messages. I would need to know what they said. Maybe there were some clues to the living sender in these messages.

3. Kearsarge put out a contract to have her husband assassinated and he was.

4. Kearsarge had refused my offer of shelter.

And that was it. A self-assured woman who was terrified.

What was real? What was imagined? How could I investigate? I could not trace the messages. I did not have either the skills or the contacts to do that. Therefore, I must assume -- can you put must and assume in the same sentence -- that old-fashioned inquiry was needed to solve this,
this -- it was not a crime, at least not yet.

There are very few criminal statutes on Hypatia. The Pharaoh Star System lies outside of Coalition space. Originally used by the League of Hypatian Pirates as a cache for their treasure -- stolen goods mostly from star ships -- Ptolemy City now is home to the rich and famous and
those who want to be rich and famous. Business can be done efficiently -- or at least that is the claim. Laws do not get in the way. As a former police detective, I look on these  assertions with a jaundiced eye. Ptolemy City is a lawless town. The only laws which are enforced
with any regularity are those which protect the service workers from being exploited.

At first, there were no such requirements. The business people thought the service workers were at their mercy and could be compelled to do any kind of work for very low wages and poor working and living conditions. After all, these people could not afford to leave the planet and return to Coalition space. However, lawlessness works both ways. After a few
deaths of some powerful folks, the two sides adopted a mutually agreed upon  covenant. It functions fairly well most of the time. The service workers get decent accommodations and wages. The rich and famous get waited upon. The service workers can expect to be protected from harm and the rich and famous get to do whatever they want to each other while
not exploiting the service workers. As a police detective, I was part of the service workers. Now I had no particular status.

"If I complete this contract," I thought, "I might be considered part of the very lowest echelon of the rich and famous."

Of course, many people are neither rich and famous nor service workers. These are the people who work for the rich and famous either directly or indirectly. The League of Hypatian Pirates perform many useful functions while operating entirely outside the law. To get this dubious privilege, (I am speaking here as a former police detective), one must be a member
of the League. All sorts of riffraff belongs to the League. Was I dealing with these folks? If so, my former association with Captain Star Runner might prove very useful.

The preliminary background check of Kearsarge arrived later in the afternoon. I sat down and read it with interest. Kearsarge was not the woman I thought she was.

## I Read Reports

The co-op provides meals. I can either go downstairs to the
well-appointed dining room or the Cafe on the Patio or I can order meals
from my kitchen. I could cook myself if I wanted to but I have never
mastered the art of measuring, chopping and heating. So I requested a
meal from the cafe and went back to the balcony to read my reports. The
kitchen would ding when the food was delivered. I do not employ a house
server, human or robot. The maid bots come in once a week as a service
of the co-op. I pay for the service, of course.

Kearsarge was thirty-two years old. She had been married to Samuel
Cornelius Mudd at the age of twenty-one.

I also put in a deep background query for Mr. S. C. Mudd. Perhaps it was
his life and death which was generating these threats.

I scolded myself.
I should have thought of this earlier when I put in Kearsarge's
background check. I was woefully out of practice in the detecting biz.
What else was I missing. My forgetfulness might have serious
repercussions.

Kearsarge currently lived at 17 Dollar Bay Drive. I raised my eyebrows.
That is a fancy address. Dollar Bay is an exclusive neighborhood in the
Upper Nile section of Ptolemy City. It borders on Torch Lake. I brought
up the areal view of that portion of the city. Indeed! Kearsarge's house
-- that is what I said -- a stand-alone house faced Torch Lake. A view
from the lake showed a large house with a dock and several boats docked
there. I was definitely dealing with the upper echelons of Ptolemy City
society.

Her financials bore this out. There was no indication of where
her money came from. Not surprising. Ptolemy City is a wide open
environment for doing practically anything.

Two things surprised me:

1\. Kearsarge was a runner. Not a star runner -- those Pantherans who
pilot star ships like my X-partner. She ran on her feet and competed in
marathons. In fact, she was scheduled to run in the Olympics in two
days. Kearsarge competed both on Hypatia and in the Coalition. She was
rated in the top ten. Lately, she had slipped from number three to
number eight. None of the commentators knew why. There was a lot of
speculation surrounding the death of her husband. Although his
assassination was known locally, the Coalition experts had no idea the
cause of Samuel Mudd's death.

2\. Kearsarge was not from Hypatia. I always assumed people were,
especially younger people. It took a lot of money to travel to and live
well here.

At the end of the report, the background service offered to provide me
with more information of Kearsarge's life inside the Coalition. This was
an additional fee that was quite steep.

I considered. Kearsarge had lived in Ptolemy City for the last four
years. Would I need to go back further than this?

I decided to forgo collecting more information at this point in my
investigation. If I needed to go back farther I would. Otherwise, it was
likely to be information I did not need to know about another human
being's life and therefore a waste of money. Her schooling was probably
not important nor the names of her parents. Curiously, Kearsarge only
seemed to have this one name. But maybe that was an Hypatian affectation
and a promotional gambit for her running.

This turned out to be a deadly decision on my part.

As I finished the remains of my dinner, I wondered how it was that
Kearsarge found me on the Valley of Kings outside of the Galactic Diner.
Was it simply that Dad had said I frequented the place? It was a simple
enough explanation but was it the correct one? And why did someone who
lived at 17 Dollar Bay Drive frequent a hole in the wall like the Elwood
Diner off of Lower Nile Street? Another affectation? Or did she do some
sort of business there? She certainly had roamed far afield to get
there.

Samuel Cornelius Mudd's background check arrived, confirming his death
by blaster seven weeks ago. Emily Dickinson executed the contract. I
knew him slightly. He was a friend and former lover of Captain Star
Runner. Would I ever be rid of Star?

I was surprised Emily Dickinson was back in town.

Mudd was a manager in charge of mining operations on Mark Antony, the
larger of Hypatia's moons. He had been brought in to streamline
operations there four years ago, hence the couple's move here. His
salary, although substantial, did not explain the fashionable residence
on Dollar Bay Drive. They would have been comfortable for sure, but on
his compensation the house was out of reach. The background check
confirmed this was their only place of residence in Ptolemy City.

So what went wrong? Why was Kearsarge receiving death threats and who
was sending them? Why did she have her husband killed?

A case gets under my skin. I need to know the answers. Truthfully, I am
not so much driven by a need for justice as I want to solve the mystery
and see how all the pieces fit together. With the information now
assembled, I wanted to find the rest of the pieces and fit them together
to see the whole picture.

Against my better judgment for getting involved in a case which began
with an assassination, I signed the contract. Within seconds thirty-five
percent of the fee reached my account and one week of expense money
followed shortly thereafter.

I was gainfully employed.

I sent a notice to the Governing Board advising them that I should be
listed as a private investigator. This gave me some privileges and some
responsibilities. For example, if I killed someone in self defense,
public reference to me would be suppressed.

This was not comforting. I did not want to be in a situation where I
deemed such drastic action necessary.

I began to list the information I needed from Kearsarge. I needed
another meeting with her.

1\. The content of the messages.

2\. A request for a meeting as soon as possible.

I sent the request. As with the contract, the messages arrived promptly.
Unfortunately, Kearsarge said she could not meet with me until her
marathon run was over. However, she could meet me at the Elwood Diner
the following morning after the race for breakfast.

Always more questions. Did the folks at the Elwood Diner know who she
was? Or like me, were they oblivious of her identity. Would anything
change after the marathon on Thursday?

As Hypatia's rotation turned Ptolemy City away from Pharaoh, Cleopatra,
the smaller moon, began to rise.. Lights came on all around the lake and
the glow from Hypatia's volcanoes intensified against the night sky.

As I looked skyward, I wondered where Star was tonight.

## I Renew My Acquaintance with Emily Dickinson

Emily Dickinson agreed to see me the following afternoon. I grabbed a
Caravan, a driverless compartment which travels the city. The particular
caravan which came by the Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority was a
called a gazelle, the smallest compartment, which seats two comfortably.

"Shepheard's Hotel," I said, and off I went.

Emily Dickinson told me to meet him at the Nefertiti Bar.

I wondered about this. The last time I saw Emily Dickinson we were on
the Northern Frontier and he had sworn off drink forever. (The Northern
Frontier borders Coalition space. Many people who would prefer to live
outside the Coalition populate planets and space stations. Although not
all -- the Republic of Space and Queen's World, for example -- of the
planets and space stations are loosely linked by the Alliance of Worlds.

Emily Dickinson operated for many years as a stand up comic and an
assassin. It sounded like an odd combination but he made it work. Emily
Dickinson maintained his moniker was a stage name, but it was the only
one anyone used in Ptolemy City. I remembered his given name was
Eberhardt Dietrich.

"Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo always called him that," I thought as I
alighted from the Gazelle outside Shepheard's Hotel.

"Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo," I corrected myself. "It's Star who
continues to call her 'Captain'."

Star and Emily Dickinson were lovers once. But that was a long while
back before I knew either of them personally.

"But then, that was when you first saw Star," I reminded myself,
"prancing across the hotel lobby, a long filmy scarf tied about the
fuchsia-colored Pantheran's neck. Star was breath-taking, tail held
high, ears up and pointing straight forward, whiskers quivering.

"Stop that," I told myself severely. "It's over. You have a job to do.
You need to focus on Emily Dickinson right now. Stop wallowing in the
past."

I walked purposefully across the label toward the Nefertiti Bar, pushed
the door open -- none opening doors are certainly an affectation -- and
stepped inside the coolness and the darkened room.

Darkness, the theory ran, made a bar intimate and perhaps even romantic.
A bar in the early afternoon on a weekday was none of these things. It
was a place for people to drink, especially people with nothing else to
do.

Emily Dickinson was easy to spot at the bar. His bulk spread toward the
bar stools on either side of him. I squeezed onto the chair next to him.

"Gregory," Emily Dickinson to the bartender, "give the little lady a
drink."

I cringed inside. I am neither little or, in my humble opinion, a lady.

"I'll have a club with a twist of lime," I said.

"That's all?" Emily Dickinson asked. He sounded affronted by my choice.

"I'm working," I said. No need to go into the fact I choose not to drink
at all.

"Put her drink on my tab," Emily Dickinson told Gregory.

"Sure thing," Gregory said.

"And I'll have another."

Gregory set another glass down next to the almost full one in front of
the big man.

"So, Detective, you wanted to talk to me," Emily Dickinson said.

"Yes," I said, "but I'm not a detective anymore."

"Now I'm willing wage that pussy cat of yours will continue to call you
Detective Ronnie Camberwell." Emily Dickinson spoke in his deep gravely
voice.

"Star and I dissolved our partnership," I said, having difficulty
keeping the stiffness out of my voice. After all, I wanted Emily
Dickinson to open up to me.

"That's what I heard," Emily Dickinson said, "but I didn't know what
else to call you."

"Ronnie will be fine," I said, taking a sip of my drink through the
straw after having put the lime slice into the fizzy water.

OK, Ronnie, how can I help you?"

Emily Dickinson seemed to be quite affable today. I remember him as
surly and unwilling to talk to me when I questioned him as a police
detective. I doubted my relationship with Star would not have softened
Emily Dickinson up. What was his angle? What did he want.

"I want to talk to you about the contract you signed with Kearsarge," I
said.

"Kearsarge?" Emily Dickinson considered the name.

"The contract concerning her husband Samuel Mudd," I prompted.

"My memory isn't what it used to be," Emily Dickinson confided. "I may
need some help to remember what you want to know."

I started to say, "The man you assassinated seven weeks ago," but
stopped myself before speaking this thought aloud. The information was
not free. Emily Dickinson wanted some sort of payment.

"What would help you remember?" I asked, wondering if I was willing to
pay. Emily Dickinson's sexual escapades were legendary.

"A small thing," Emily Dickinson said. "The matter of my bar tab, if you
could settle that with Gregory while I ransack my memory for details--"

I saw Gregory hide a smirk.

Emily Dickinson's drinking was also legendary. Even so, I struggled to
keep from showing my astonishment at the amount. My expense report would
look very interesting. No wonder Emily Dickinson had ordered a second
drink and put my drink on his tab.

I paid.

"Thank you very kindly," Emily Dickinson said. "I am much obliged. Since
returning to Ptolemy City, it has been difficult to get re-established.
You're probably finding it slow-going yourself."

I decided to ignore this last remark and his effusive thanks. Clearly
Emily Dickinson should not be drinking. The amount of his tab
demonstrated that. I knew the terms of the assassination contract. He
was paid well. I also suspected his lived somewhere off of Lower Nile
Street in one of the tiny one-room flats. His money could have lasted
him for years if he chose to be careful with it. He had not.

"Kearsarge's contract," I said again.

Emily Dickinson turned his glass in his hand and seemed to be searching
for an answer in its depths.

Finally he asked, "What is your interest?"

"I am her private investigator," I said. I did not have to give anything
away for free either.

"And your interest in our contract is--"

"She is receiving unusual death threats," I said. "I am wondering if
your contract with her may be at the root of these threats."

Emily Dickinson continued to swirl his drink.

"She is a public figure," Emily Dickinson said. "Perhaps one of her
opponents in the marathon is hoping she will withdraw from the race."

"I doubt the threats would be so graphic," I said, remembering how
gruesome and explicit they were. "Besides," I said, "they wouldn't be
signed 'Love, Sam'."

"No, I suppose not," Emily Dickinson said, putting down his drink very
carefully. Emily Dickinson did not slur his words. I could not think of
a time when he did.

"It was a sad business," Emily Dickinson began. "They were a striking
couple. They would come here to Shepheard's Hotel when they first came
to Ptolemy City. She was a rising star in the sports world and dressed
in all the latest fashions. He was always conservatively dressed. I
heard things. He was a good manager of the mines -- nothing spectacular,
you understand, but competent. He cleaned up some problem they were
having and ran the business quite profitably. And then ..." he trailed
off.

"And then," I prompted.

I don't know," Emily Dickinson said.

"I don't believe you," I said flatly. "You do know. This has been quite
a build up -- the young active couple comes to town, both rising stars.
They buy a fancy house with an even fancier address. And then she has
him killed. Something happened."

Emily Dickinson sighed heavily. "I'm getting too old for this," he said.
"Sam Mudd was a good man by all reports -- at least, he was a fair man
at the mines."

"It he was so unobjectionable, why have him killed," I questioned. "She
didn't like his tie? What aren't you telling me, Eberhardt?"

I hoped the use of his given name would shake more loose.

"Let's keep this civil, Ronnie, shall we?"

"Emily Dickinson, I just paid your rather substantial bar tab. I expect
to get something useful for my investigation. As far as anyone here in
town knows, no one has put a contract out on Kearsarge yet she is
receiving very gruesome and explicit death threats ostensibly coming
from her dead husband. It sounds like revenge. Who wants her dead."

"Probably quite a few people," Emily Dickinson said. His manner was
flippant.

"Because."

"Because she is a spoiled bitch."

"She didn't strike me that way," I said. "She seemed quite down to earth
and quite responsible."

"She's responsible, all right." Emily Dickinson laughed with any mirth.
"She is responsible for making her husband's life hell and then killing
him."

"If you dislike her so much, why did you accept the contract?" I asked.
His evasiveness annoyed me.

"I owed somebody, Ronnie. It's not a part of your investigation, so I
won't go into it. It was an old debt from another time. But it was
called in and I had to come back here and do the deed. I didn't have to
like it. I just had to do it."

I signaled Gregory, the bartender, to give each of us another drink.

I drank my club soda and waited for Emily Dickinson to say more.

"I don't know why you're on this case," Emily Dickinson finally said.
"That's your business. Ptolemy City is a town where people do things
they aren't proud of but they feel they have to do it. We all have our
demons, I suppose, even you, and I think I know who that demon is for
you. I suggest you suck it up and back the contract. Dealing with
Kearsarge will only cause you grief and I mean that seriously. She's bad
news and the farther away from her you can get, the better off you will
be."

"Your candor is appreciated," I said. I believed Emily Dickinson
believed everything he was telling me. But he was not telling me
everything. "But I need a direction. Can you tell me where to look?"

"I really don't know why she killed Mudd killed," Emily Dickinson said.
"But if you want to stick things out, I would look at Fair Haven."

"Fair Haven?" I queried. "I never heard of Fair Haven. What is it?"

"I'm not surprised you've never heard of it. It's a member of the Solar
League -- a very unimportant member of the League. But that's where
Kearsarge and Mudd come from. They're royalty or something like it
there. It was an arranged marriage to consolidate one of the important
families. The marriage may have worked for a while, but I don't think it
was working when they came here."

"Infidelity, then," I said.

"More than that," Emily Dickinson said, "though certainly that."

Before I could guard my tongue, I said, "You don't think I have to go to
Fair Haven, do you?"

"Probably not," Emily Dickinson said. "It just might cost you a bit to
get the information. In fact," and here he sounded more optimistic than
he had throughout our conversation, "you might find out more from afar.
Those particular kind of planets don't like people from the outside, and
you're really from outside. You weren't even born in the Coalition."

"I am a citizen of the Coalition," I said. It surprised me how irritated
I sounded.

Emily Dickinson waved his hand magnanimously. "I know that, Ronnie. They
even know that. It's the fact that you don't live there that counts.
You're an outsider from a strange planet beyond the border."

"Thanks," I said. "I'll take what you said under advisement."

"I like you," Emily Dickinson said, signaling Gregory. "Start  another
tab for me." Then turning to me for the first time in the conversation,
"Be careful, Ronnie. This could be very, very dangerous."

"I will," I said, sliding off the bar stool though I had no idea what
Emily Dickinson thought was so dangerous.

And without another look, I left Shepheard's Hotel.

My link displayed a
held message. The Fungusians confirmed receipt of my request and would
supply a response as soon as possible. The message noted that advances
in neural net design would mean my report would arrive later this
evening.

I send a message to that boy I knew in school. He agreed
to see me on short notice.

## I Talk with Josh

I remembered a boy with spiky hair and a love of anything technical. The
hair cut was trendy. The clothes were casual but neat. Josh Hardy
stilled loved his technology. He had hacked everything for as long as I
can remember.

"Hey, Ronnie," he said when he met me in his reception area. "Come on
back."

We entered an office which looked nothing like an office. Screens,
keyboards, cables and boxes, the nature of which I could not guess, were
everywhere.

"I'm still the same old Josh." His smile was self-deprecating.

"People still use keyboards?" I asked.

"Sure. They're easy and quite secure. If you speak, people can hear
you."

"You can't use thoughts?" I asked.

"We're not the big cats," Josh said, "but I guess you know all about
them. I hear you married one."

"No," I said, and left it at that. Maybe someday I would tell Josh about
that time in my life but now was not that time.

Josh sighed. "Personal relationships were never my forte." Then, always
vivacious, he said, "I'm good at technical things and that's why you're
here."

"These messages were sent," I began.

"I've been looking at them." josh broke in. "You're working for
Kearsarge. That's cool. She's really hot."

"Hot?" I asked.

"You know, sexy, very cool."

I really had been out of touch.

"Right," I said. "The messages."

"Yeah, well, they're creepy."

"That's why I'm investigating."

"Oh, yeah, sure. Well, anyway, I can trace them for a little while and
then I run into a wall."

"You run into a wall," I prompted. My interview techniques were being
sorely tested.

"Ah, Ronnie, you know messages are passed through the communications
net."

"Yes, I do."

"I can follow them all around the star system," Josh said. "They took
quite a circuitous route, probably to discourage trackers. I'm good,
Ronnie. I can follow a trail like this.  But then I can't trace it any
farther. It came from outside, but I can't figure out where. I can keep
on working on it, trying to crack the blocker, but you said it was
urgent."

Josh was crestfallen. Jamming Josh is the best legitimate hacker on
Hypatia.

"What do the pirates have to say?" I asked. I expected him to deny he
had sources within the League of Hypatian Pirates.

"I talked with them," Josh admitted. "They're just as puzzled as I am.
And that ticks them off. They don't like to be unable to eavesdrop on
someone else's conversation. They'll crack it. I'm sure of it."

"By then it won't matter," I said. I felt defeated.

"What do you mean?" Josh asked.

"These are death threats, Josh," I said. "I want to stop this guy. I
haven't a clue who he might be."

"And the marathon is tomorrow," Josh said. "Do you think anything will
happen during the race?"

"I have no idea," I said. "Kearsarge won't withdraw or even consider
protection."

"That's weird," Josh said.

"You're telling me," I said.

Wearily, I got to my feet. I was forced to wait for the background
checks from the Fungusians, if they would do them, and the general
information about Fair Haven.

"Thanks for your help," I said to Josh.

"I didn't do anything," Josh protested.

"But you'll send me a bill just the same," I said.

Josh's goofy grin returned. "Of course, I will. I have to pay for all
this stuff, Ronnie" He waved his hand around the lab.

As I reached the door Josh said, "You wouldn't want to go to out dinner
or something, would you?"

"No," I said. "I'm still not interested in guys in that way."

"Just thought I'd ask."

"No harm done," I said.

Josh and I go a way back and he always wanted to date me. I never wanted
to date him. He is not my type. At this point, I did not want to date
anyone. I felt that no woman could interest me much less a man. Star
Runner, with all flaws, was tough to match.

""But it didn't work," I reminded myself. Star is a creature of space,
uncomfortable planet side. And I would be happy if I never left Hypatia
again.## I Talk with Susan

I walked around the lake until I found my favorite bench. It was
unoccupied. I sat down and stared out at the water, listening to the
gentle slap of the waves. I began rubbing my wrist absently. The area
still itched from where my link was embedded.

"What is Emily Dickinson not telling me and why?" I wondered. "Who
knows? How can I find out?"

I started the circular motion that always helps me think, rubbing my
thumb around and around on my wrist.

"What about the messages? Who can help me with those? Who is sending
them? How? Why?"

In the Pharaoh Star System, everyone is security conscious and everyone
either is or knows a hacker. I was out of touch from my long absence. My
security firm was quite reputable but it was not in their purview to
look at these messages and tell me where they came from and who sent
them. The police were woefully short on techniques and resources. I knew
a guy from school--

"You know," I said aloud, "I bet the Fungusians could find out."

"I'm sure they could," an unfamiliar voice said.

I looked around. No one was near enough to hear me.

"I'm Susan," the voice continued, "I'm the voice of your link."

"I'm talking with my link?" I said, feeling incredibly foolish talking
to my wrist.

"Yes. You turned me on," Susan explained.

"I did? How?"

"With a circular motion," Susan replied. "Make the gesture in the
reverse direction to turn voice assistance off. Many people find it
helpful to discuss what they want to know before placing the query."

"OK," I said, thinking my question would stump the perky Susan. "How
long would it take to send a query to the Fungusian Network? And How
much would it cost?"

"The Fungusian Network processes requests promptly," Susan answered as
if her quickness advertised Fungusian responsiveness. "The message could
be sent and returned in a day and a half. The cost is reasonable."

"A day and a half?" I was flabbergasted. "The Fungusian Network is quite
distant."

"There is a direct communication pathway from the Pharaoh Star System to
the research laboratories in the Fungusian Network. Therefore the cost
is similar to contacting locations on the Northern and Southern
Frontiers."

Captain Star Runner again. All of Star's AI systems are produced by and
serviced by the Fungusians. Of course there is a direct pathway to the
research labs. Star probably figured out how to cut through hyperspace
to get there as quickly as possible. It would not be difficult for a
message routed to the research labs  to be dispatched to the correct
sub-network.

In for a penny, in for a pound.

"I want to ask the Fungusians if they can determine where Kearsarge's
messages are coming from. I believe you have the particulars Kearsarge
sent me. Explain the nature of the investigation and I only want the
information that will be useful to solving the mystery."

"Got it. The message is on its way."

That simple. I realized that life with Captain Star Runner opened me up
to the possibilities of reaching far out into the galactic western arm
for information I needed. I was not too uncomfortable talking with Susan
either. All that time aboard Star's ship gave me ample time to adjust to
talking with Christabel, Star's AI. I began to think the artificial
intelligence was my rival. When I muttered something of that sort in
Christabel's hearing, she, and Christabel is definitely a she, replied,
quite primly as I remembered it,  that at some level she and Star
weren't separate identities. They shared brain and computer memory
space. The whole thing was just a bit creepy. In the good times, I tried
to ignore Christabel's presence altogether.

And here I was talking to my link who called herself Susan.

Why are you called Susan?" I asked for something to say.

"Because the shape of your link is a flower. It resembles a black-eyed
Susan, a flower from Earth."

Well, it was as good a reason as any.

"I'll need general information about the planet Fair Haven on the Southern Frontier," I said after a little while. "I want to know if either
Kearsarge or Samuel Cornelius Mudd are known to the general profile of
the planet."

I got up from the bench and rubbed my wrist in the circular motion Susan
described for turning her voice off. I tested the operation. Susan was
silent. Good.

I return to the Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority. I was about to
have a meal at the Patio Cafe when my link tickled.

"An incoming message from my link," I thought. "Who could be calling
me?"

## I Talk with Simon Parge

The message I received on my link was short and to the point: You are
missing many salient points. Come immediately. SP

Simon Parge is my mentor. He worked on the Ptolemy City police force for
many, many years, solving crimes and more importantly on Hypatia,
gaining the respect of the rich and famous, the service workers and the
pirates. He retired when his health failed. Although Aesculapius Medical
Center is one of the finest human beings operate, Simon Parge prefers to
sit in his chair and enjoy Mrs. Parge's cooking.

I had not called upon the Parges since my return to Ptolemy City.
Although shocked at my partnering with Captain Star Runner, Star won
Mrs. Parge's heart by happily sampling all of her cooking.

Simon trained my dad and then me and my brother in turn. He is the best
detective ever.

A summons to Pimlico is not to be ignored. I turned away from the Patio
Cafe, re-crossed the coop lobby and grabbed a camel caravan. I had the
larger vehicle all to myself. People from the Tenderloin do not
ordinarily travel to Pimlico at this time of night. The shifts at the
fancier places had already changed.

Pimlico is one of the areas where the service workers live. It is near
one of the dome walls, far from the Nile. (The outer ring of the dome,
except for the Fends, have many fashionable homes and hotels adjoining
the wall.

Mrs. Parge threw her arms around me when she answered the door.

"It is so good to see you, Ronnie," she said, "have you eaten?"

This is Mrs. Parge's greeting every time I com to visit. She is a thin
woman with lots of energy. She has always been this way. I have known
her all my life.

Mrs. Parge will say nothing about Captain Star Runner unless and until I
bring Star up. She respects my privacy. If I ever do want to talk about
this part of my life, Mrs. Parge will be an attentive listener, give
sage advice and zero in on what I am thinking and feeling. In her own
right, she is an excellent detective, too.

"Ronnie can eat later, Mrs. Parge," Simon boomed from the next room. "I
need to see her now."

"You better go in there," Mrs. Parge whispered. "He's been raging for
the last two days. I'll just go into the kitchen and fix something for
you to eat when you're finished."

With a certain amount of dread, I went into the next room. As expected,
Simon Parge sat in his anti-gravity wheelchair, dressed in a dressing
gown and red and blue carpet slippers. On an attached table sat his
tablet. He was ready to both ream me out and instruct me.

"Hello, Simon," I said as bravely and as carelessly as possible. "How
are you?"

"If you were interested in the answer to that question you would have
come here when you got back to Ptolemy City," Simon said. Another would
have characterized his response as a growl. Having heard Star growl for
real, I just call his way of speaking irritated.

I waited in silence for him to continue. Not playing into Simon's game
is part of the process of dealing with him. As the saying goes, his bark
is worse than his bite.

"Well, you might as well sit down and listen to what I have to say," he
said.

I did.

"So why did you get involved with Kearsarge?" Simon demanded.

Why did I get involved? Simon values the truth. He will drill down to my
true reasons for taking the case if I do not tell him right away and his
drilling can be very painful.

"I thought she needed my help," I said. "She was very scared."

"And do you take in stray puppies and kittens, too?" Simon continued his
barrage.

Ouch. Was this a veiled reference to Star? I decided to ignore it.

"I was also intrigued," I said. "Nothing makes sense."

"And what are you doing to make sense of it?" Simon's grilling is
relentless.

"I have gotten some general information about Kearsarge and her dead
husband Samuel Cornelius Mudd. I have put in requests for more
information about each of them and their planet of emigration, Fair
Haven, on the Southern Frontier. I have talked with Emily Dickinson who
Kearsarge contracted with to assassinate her husband and I have talked
with Josh Hardy about the source of the messages."

"And what you learned?"

Simon was in rare form tonight. He would learn what I knew before
revealing what he knew. In this way he showed me up as ineffective.
Simon reveled in this form of information sharing.

Kearsarge is running in the marathon tomorrow," I began. "She refuses
any protection though she is receiving death threats. She contracted to
have her husband assassinated. They lived in a detached house on Dollar
Drive with direct access to the lake. She continues to live there and
has substantial financial resources. Josh cannot trace the messages
beyond the star system. And Samuel Mudd was a well-liked and competent
mine manager."

"Not much," Simon observed.

Long ago I learned not to rise to Simon's bate. He would tell me now
what he summoned me here to say.

"Emily Dickinson agreed to talk with you?"

This was new. Apparently Simon never had success engaging one of the top
assassins in the Pharaoh Star System.

"I know him slightly," I said. "He warned me off the case."

"Why?" Simon's question was sharp-edged.

"He wouldn't say," I said. "He knows something but he wasn't giving it
up. I covered his entire bar tab, which was substantial, but he kept
mum."

"Drinking will kill him," Simon muttered.

"I agree," I said. "He stopped briefly, but he didn't stay sober."

Simon did not answer immediately. When he did speak, he took a different
tact.

"So how are you going to get their background checks on Fair Haven?"

"I have a request into the Fungusians Network," I said. "They will have
indexed all the information available."

"I should have a response shortly," I said, checking the time on my
link. "I requested an acknowledgement and it came in earlier today when
I talked with Emily Dickinson."

Simon was speechless. I had done something he only had not done, but had
not even imagined possible. I pressed my advantage.

"They were ones who had the information I need," I said, "so I reached
out to them. Kearsarge's money makes that possible, but I had the
contact. Now I have a contact in the correct department for such work."

"And where was your contact?" Simon asked, a bit more insistently than
necessary. He was still reeling from my couix.

"The research lab," I said breezily. "I received a very friendly
response from them. I forwarded Josh's findings on the neural net block.
They thanked me for it and will send him a solution when they have one.
They were quite confident it would be soon based on a certain level of
complexity I have no experience to evaluate."

"And how did you penetrate the Fungusians Network?" Simon was now in
full drilling mode.

I put up my hand.

Down boy," I said. "Captain Star Runner's AI and ship are maintained by
the Fungusians Network. I simply used Star's contact. They knew who I
was."

"The inimical Captain Star Runner," Simon said.

An awkward silence ensued.

"That was a good call, Veronica," Simon said with grudging admiration.
"If only half of what I hear is true,, about the mushrooms, you'll have
some topnotch information and a way through the neural net blockage.
That could be the key to everything."

"You need to let Ronnie eat something," Mrs. Parge said, coming to stand
in the doorway. "After she eats, you can continue interrogating her."

"I taught her everything she knows," Simon boasted to his wife. "And you
know what she has done?"

"I would have no idea," Mrs. Parge replied, knowing full well how this
game was played.

"She contacted the Fungusian Network and she has them eating out of her
hand, so to speak." Too late Simon realized the Fungusians would not eat
out of anyone's hand.

"Remarkable," Mrs. Parge replied.

I never knew if she understood what Simon was saying and more to the
point, if she cared. She was smart enough. Secretly, I believe she is
more clever than Simon, but she never lets on which is why they are such
a successful couple. Simon's ego is as big as he is.

The meal Mrs. Parge served me was the best I had eaten since my return
to Ptolemy City. I eat ravenously, exclaiming over every dish. Simon
remained in his chair in the other room, restless because of the
interruption.

"We'll wait to have dessert until you two finish," Mrs. Parge confided
in me. "It won't sit right in your stomach if Simon is lecturing you."

I returned to Simon.

"And what information am I missing?" I asked him. "You said that in your
message."

"It's about time you asked me about it," Simon grumbled, picking up his
tablet. Simon prefers not to rely on his link for all information.. He
claims links fail with such regularity that he would be losing valuable
tidbits all the time. I think he just likes the drama of reading off the
screen.

The planet of Fair Haven may well be at the crux of Kearsarge's
problems," Simon began.


## Simon Parge Tells Me About Fair Haven

"Let me tell you about Fair Haven," Simon said, adjusting his chair. ,,\
 I knew I was in for a long monologue.

"Fair Haven is a planet on the Southern Frontier."

"I thought Fair Haven was in the Solar League."

"I'm getting to that," Simon said. "Just listen. Fair Haven is on the
Southern Frontier."

"I've been to the Southern Frontier," I commented. I could not help
myself.

"Have you been to Fair Haven, Missy?" Simon demanded.

"No," I said.

"Then you remark is out of order," Simon said. "Please refrain from
making unnecessary comments."

"Yes, sir," I said. Being contrite helps. "Fair Haven is a planet on the
Southern Frontier. It is one of the oldest settled planets on the
Southern Frontier. As a result, it is near the Coalition border."

I wondered how far Fair Haven was from the Three Ravens Space Station. I
had been there during the Landscape of Thorns Adventure. (Note: This is
a Star Runner Adventure which is not yet published.) It was one of the
only pieces of information I possessed about the Southern Frontier.

Simon was saying, "Because of its proximity to the Coalition Border and
because of its early settlement, Fair Haven has been considered part of
the Solar League. It sends a representative to all League meetings but
is an observer only. They have voice but not vote which means, before
you interrupt to ask, that they can speak in all deliberations but they
have no vote. Given the ongoing closure of the border, I don't know at
this time if they are able to attend meetings at all.

"The arrangement of Fair Haven being outside the Coalition has suited it
very well. Some questionable activities have always been assumed to take
place there. Some have even called it Smuggler's Haven.

"But with the building of the Three Ravens Space Station, much of the
smuggling business is conducted there. Presumably Fair Haven can act as
a staging area for those willing to try to slip across the border with
cargoes and evade the patrols. There has been accusations that the Solar
League has turned a blind eye toward any vessel violating the border if
it hails from Fair Haven. The big cats want to patrol that portion of
the border but for the moment, the Solar League is showing some backbone
and is not amenable to their presence there."

I wondered what Captain Star Runner would have to say about the
situation. I supposed the Pantherans could bring their military ships
into the area any time they wanted. It was apparently political
expedient for them to maintain the myth that they respected the wishes
of the Solar League. I decided to share nothing of my insights gained by
my time with Star and Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo who was high in the
Ministry of Defense for the Northern Frontier. I did not know how much
of what I knew was classified.

"Over time, Fair Haven has developed an upper class that considers
itself royalty. As far as I can determine, no one is descended from old
Earth royalty on any continent. These royal families hold all the
political and to a large extent, the economic power. On the good side,
they patronize the arts and sciences. On the bad side, they constantly
bicker among themselves and from time to time there is armed conflict,
though they refrain from weapons which will cause mass destruction to
either populations or the environment.

"And lest you think that princesses and princes are all charming and
beautiful people," Simon said, pointing a finger at me, "they are not.

"I would not call their society medieval. It is from a later date than
that, but they prefer to live in a very definitely non-modern era."

"Like the holo dramas?" I asked, envisioning castles and knights in
shining armor. I always thought the women in these stories were
creatures who only seemed to care about marrying the right person to
advance their social program and what gown to wear.

"To some extent," Simon agreed grudgingly. "There are castles and fancy
dresses, but they are not as barbaric as to insist on riding horses
everywhere. They have state-of-the-art security systems, use the neural
net and practice the latest medicine."

"So their society prefers the social and political aspects of royalty
but does not cling to a particular time reference," I summed up.

There wee places that did this, or so I had heard. They outlawed
technological advancements even to subjugating other people and refusing
them modern medical care. The Solar League brought charges against them
to the Coalition as human rights violations, but the Coalition was slow
to act. Their published reason was a policy on non-interference with
member worlds. Although Star never commented on this particular
situation, I suspected the real reason was that the Pantherans did not
really care what humans did to each other. They also did not want any
interference with their societal norms which were, in my opinion, quite
brutal to the un gendered members of the Race.

"Here I go again," I thought, "thinking of Star and using Star's
phraseology."

"They don't have surfs or burn witches, if that is what you mean," Simon
responded.

"The thing I want to stress to you, Ronnie, is that the royalty of Fair
Haven do not want outsiders on their planet. You only go there by
invitation. Someone there would have to want you to investigate for you
to be allowed to go there. If Kearsarge gave you permission, you could
go. Otherwise, do not get it into your head to just take off."

"I'm home to stay," I assured Simon. "Space travel does not interest
me."

Of course, I did not know then what I was to learn later.

"Do you have any information about Kearsarge or Samuel Cornelius Mudd?"
I asked.

"Kearsarge, the marathon runner," Simon mused. "She took the Solar
League by storm. She was rated number two when she was twenty-eight
years old. Since then, her ranking has slipped."

"Since she came to Ptolemy City," I added.

"Precisely," Simon said. "That information, by the way, is not widely
known. Her family, a well-connected royal family, has not let it be
known that she lives here."

"She's running tomorrow," I said.

"Indeed she is. The smart money is not on her, according to my sources.
The three top rated runners from the Solar League have made it all the
way out here and she is not expected to win any medals."

"She's on Fair Haven's team, right?"

"No, she is not. She is running as an independent. There have been a
number of profiles about her: her chances at a come-back, rehearsing her
rise to stardom, promoting her as a princess wanting to regain her crown
-- that sort of nonsense. The reporters have not delved much into her
life here. In fact, they do not indicate that Sam Mudd is dead. He is
presumed to be tied up with the mining company on Mark Antony and unable
to be part of the holo shoots. The commentators are speculating if he
can get away for the race."

"But he's dead," I protested. "and she assassinated him."

"But the press does not know that, Ronnie. You know the local press does
not report on assassinations. It would be bad for the tourist trade,
especially now when everyone's here for the Olympics."

"Well, I suppose," I said. "By the way, was Mudd a royal, too?"

"Most definitely," Simon said. "He was more of a royal than she is."

"So why did he come here to manage a mine on Mark Antony for heaven's
sake. This is making no sense at all."

"No one knows for certain who owns the mines," Simon said. "You know as
well as I do that there is a company name on everything, but as to who
owns it--"

"I thought the Pirates owned it."

"That's everyone's best guess," Simon admitted. "But who exactly. You
don't think the League of Hypatian Pirates have the papers in their safe
at the guild's headquarters, do you?"

"I suppose not," I said, thinking it over. That would mean every pirate
that was a member of the guild would have a share in the profits. That
made no sense at all.

"So perhaps the smuggling connection with Fair Haven is at play here,,"
I said.

"Altogether possible," Simon said,, "but is that relevant to your
investigation?"

"It could be," I said slowly, trying to think it through. "Emily
Dickinson told me it was an arranged marriage. That fits in with the
royal family angle. Don't they do that sort of thing?"

"Follow it through," Simon encouraged. He was now in mentor mode.

"OK, there is an arranged marriage between two royal families. It is
better for Kearsarge's family than for Mudd's, but she is not seen as a
threat. In fact, her running career could be scene as an asset. It would
give lots of positive press coverage, especially if Mudd's family is, an
excuse the pun here, a bit dirty in pirate business."

"Plausible," Simon commented.

"Suppose, and this is a real stretch," I continued, "Mudd's family has
an interest in the mine. Perhaps the Fair Haven crowd thinks the League
of Hypatian Pirates is defrauding them some how. They send a family
member to clean up the mess. Emily Dickinson indicated Mudd was brought
on to fix something at the mines. He brings his wife with him. They buy
a fancy house because they have family money and a stand-alone house on
Dollar Bay Drive is as close to a royal residence as they can get here..
They don't want to draw attention to themselves by having a separate
dome built elsewhere. Besides, he will be gone a lot on Mark Antony and
she needs to train and have stimulation."

"Makes sense." Simon spoke to keep me going.

If he's telling me the truth, and I think he has not told me all the
truth by a long shot, Kearsarge either is or became very vicious. He
used the word 'infidelity' but I'm not sure in what context. Sam Mudd
found out about it and was going to do something about it and she had
him assassinated."

"That does not hold together, Veronica," Simon scolded. "The royal
families bicker on Fair Haven, but assassinations are almost unheard
of."

"But this is Ptolemy City," I argued. "Assassinations are common here.
It's easy to hire one and they're effective. Sam Mudd should have simply
caught the next ship out of here and headed for Three Ravens Space
Station and home. If Fair Haven is as closed as you say,, he would have
been safe."

"Unless the folks back home are involved, too, somehow," Simon
speculated. "Once the contract was posted, they may have just let things
take their course."

"There's something else," I said, finding the threads still too knotted
to unravel. "Emily Dickinson said he owed someone big time. He came back
to Ptolemy City to fulfill the terms of the contract. So there must be a
connection between that person or persons and Kearsarge."

"Another triangle. I am coming to the view that you are right about the
Pirates being involved in some way. Emily Dickinson has done a lot of
work for them."

We were quiet for a time. Each of us was thinking, though my thoughts
were getting me nowhere.

"Not to bring up a sore subject," Simon said, "but do you think that cat
of yours could be involved?"

"Captain Star Runner is not my cat," I retorted, a bit more sharply than
I intended. It was a very sore subject with me and I disliked Simon
bringing Star up. "Star did work for the League and did become a member.
But Star is not in this area of space now. If Star did have any dealings
with Fair Haven, it is very much in the past. It is not a present
operation. It is conceivable Star could have been involved early on,
when Mudd first came here, but that is all I can imagine. Star is
basically a courier, getting goods from here to there extremely quickly
with no questions asked. For all I know, Star did a regular run to Fair
Haven, but Star would not cross the Coalition border."

"And why is that?" Simon asked, leaning forward. "I never understood--"

"That is Star's problem," I cut in. "I am not involved with Star anymore
and unless Star is directly involved, we need not speak about Star
anymore."

I was determined not to talk about Captain Star Runner to Simon and Mrs.
Parge. My sentence constructions were always awkward. I dislike using he
ungendered pronoun it though Star never minded. I chose she because I am
a lesbian. I knew Emily Dickinson and Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo used
he. I never knew how Tamara thought of Star. It was she who always used
Star's name and that works for me now.

## I See Kearsarge Again

 It was late when I got home. No messages from the Fungusians came. Susan
checked the time of the marathon. It began at ten o'clock. I wondered
how Kearsarge would do.

"You have a message," Susan announced.

"Damn. I left my link in voice mode.

"This message is sent with voice mode enabled," Susan continued. "You
turned voice off."

"Are you reading minds now?" I asked.

I am not a person you should wake up unexpectedly. I am very grumpy and
I do not focus easily.

"No," Susan replied. "Most people wonder if they have left the voice on
when they receive such a message."

"Who's it from?"

I was wondering what I could do that person in return. I am usually not
vengeful, but it was 5:30 a.m.

"Police chief Troy Camberwell," Susan said.

I had not spoken to my father since my return to Ptolemy City. We had
not had a falling out. It was just that he had let me go at the police
department. Previously, his response to Captain Star Runner can only be
described generously as frigid. Why was he calling me at 5:30 in the
morning?

All the message said was: Call me.

"Dad," I said when he answered his link.

"Sorry to waken you," Dad said, "but aren't you working for Kearsarge?"

There was no point to ask him how he knew. I had registered my
investigation with the Governing Board and he would have been notified.

"You know I am," I responded.

I told you I was grumpy in the morning.

"I need you to come down here," Dad said. "I think she's dead."

Dad gave me the address. I thought I knew all the streets in Ptolemy
City, but Susan had to look this one up.

The River District? What was Kearsarge doing in the River District at
5:30 in the morning? It was worst neighborhood in Ptolemy City. Only the
most desperate people lived there. City service workers were afraid to
go there to fix anything. People lived in abandoned buildings with
broken windows. Trash did not get picked up. Electricity was often
absent. In short, the River District was Ptolemy City's slum. People
went in there and were never seen again. I was surprised the police were
there. Who had summoned them?

None of my questions would be answered until I got to the scene. I got
out of bed, pulled on some clothes I found draped over a chair and
stepped out of my flat. Too late I remembered there would be no hot tea
at the scene. I would have to make do with coffee... Given my mood, that
would suit me just fine.

I grabbed a gazelle and sat back for the ride. The car had the nerve to
ask me to confirm my destination.

"Yes, I really do want to go to 2115 Green Way Station."

What a name. I wondered what the street had once been like to have such
a name. I thought to ask Susan on the long ride to the seamier side of
the city.

"According to city records," Susan reported, "Green Way Station once had
lovely homes for the richer pirates. It was thought of as a privileged
enclave."

"how the mighty have fallen," was my only comment. I switched Susan off
when I exited the Gazelle. Was it my imagination or did it speed away
toward the city's center?

I found my dad with a coffee cup in his hand in what must have been a
fancy foyer of a large home. It was filled with trash and no sign of its
former grandeur remained except for a scarred staircase with most of its
railing either broken or missing.

"You wanted me," I said in greeting.

"I figured you could identify the body," Dad said without so much as a
greeting.

"But you think it's her," I said.

"I do, but she's a long way from home," Dad said.

"Where is she?"

"Outside," Dad said. "We've been questioning the residents here, but no
one knows anything, saw anything, heard anything."

"Do they ever?"

"In this case, you could be telling the truth. We just had to ask." Dad
shrugged.

We walked outside and down the street to the corner. I saw the yellow
crime scene tape. The tape was quaint, but everyone seems to know what
it signifies so the Ptolemy City Police Department continues to use it
instead of pricey portable force fields. Simon Parge, when he was police
chief, thought salaries were more important than fancy equipment and Dad
has followed in his footsteps.

The body was in the intersection...

"I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before," I commented.

"That's how we got the call," Dad said. "She was picked up by the
caravans. They put in a request for maintenance on this intersection.
This is where you would have been dropped off for this house instead of
where you did get out."

"I figured I had to walk up the street because the gazelle didn't want
to be in this neighborhood," I said.

"True enough, but this is a busier street."

I walked over to the body. Kearsarge was laying on her side. She looked
like she had been dropped there like a rag doll. I bent down and looked
at her face. It was Kearsarge all right.

"That's Kearsarge,"" I said, straightening up.

"Any idea why she should be in the River District at this hour when she
was scheduled to run in a marathon later this morning?" Dad asked.

"None," I said. "I was supposed to meet her for breakfast tomorrow
morning off of Lower Nile Street."

"Lower Nile Street?" Dad questioned.

"The Elwood Street Diner," I said. "It's a little hole in the wall with
personal service. I thought it was an odd location for her, too."

Dad gave some instructions to the crime scene people then turned to me.

"We need to talk," he said.

"Sure," I said, having no idea what he meant. "Now?"

"Now," Dad said. "Walk with me."

I followed him back down the street. He fumbled with his link. A caravan
came -- a camel to be exact -- and we climbed in. He gave the police
station as our destination.

We rode in silence, each of us stretching out our long legs toward the
empty seat in front of us, facing each other obliquely, wondering what
to say to fill silence. At least, I was wondering. Finally my dad said.

"How are you, Ronnie, I mean, really, since you've been back."

Dad was never good at this sort of thing. He left most of my care as a
child to Mrs. Parge. Mrs. Parge always was clear with me: She was not my
mother. She was a caring friend of the family. She answered my questions
when I learned Dad was not my biological father. My mother had an affair
and I was the result. My mother left my father after I was born and was
killed by her companion shortly thereafter. The companion shipped out of
Ptolemy City immediately and was never heard of again. A warrant for his
arrest was still active, or at least had been when I was on the police
force. I doubt it had been nullified.

Although he could have disowned me, Troy Camberwell did not and raised
me as his daughter even-handled with my older brother Kevin. My origins
was not something we ever discussed. All my father had ever said as,
"Don't be too hard on your mother. She wasn't like Mrs. Parge. She
needed her husband at home every night."

"I'm OK," I said. "It's been hard coming back but it's for the best."
Then I remembered to add, "I'm living at the Womyn's Cooperative Housing
Authority. I am well-provided for. If I'm careful, the money will last."

"Really?" Dad was surprised. Not much surprises him anymore. "Yes," I
said. "Captain Star Runner is good with money and was quite generous,
more generous than a partner needed to be. In different circumstances,
it may have worked out. But in the situation we found ourselves in, it
didn't."

"So things were amicable?"

"More sad than amicable," I said. "I miss Star terribly -- at least, I
miss the Star I once knew."

"I see," Dad said. He looked sad. I wondered if he was thinking of my
mother. Before I could ask him, Dad changed the subject.

"As you know, we're short-handed. Because of her notoriety, Kearsarge
death will be big news and probably big news back in the Solar League. I
don't have the resources to investigate. I don't think, technically
speaking, I am required to investigate. She was not a service worker.
But you know, I like to know what happened, if there is a bigger problem
than the unexplained death of one of the Rich and Famous. I'm wondering
if you would be willing to look into this."

I was stunned. It was not an invitation to rejoin the police force, but
it was as close as I was probably going to get. Having a good working
relationship with Dad really appealed to me. But there were
complications.

"It would put me in the limelight," I said. "There would be a lot of
questions."

Not to mention expose about Star and me.

"I'll handle the press," Dad said. "The police will not be investigating
this matter. It is regrettable, but it is the custom here in Ptolemy
City."

"Will there be an autopsy?"

"We'll see what we can determine," Dad said. "There's insurance, I
presume."

"I have no idea," I said. "I only met her once and that over breakfast.
I'm not even sure if I can investigate. I'll have to check the
contract."

I put in a request to my legal advisor.

"I don't know who is her heir and who will manage her affairs. For all I
know, I'm done."

Dad frowned. "You're probably right. It's not a particularly elegant
solution, but I do want to know what she was doing there and who killed
her."

"So do I," I said. "And there may be a way to find out."

I told Dad about the messages, about my attempts to locate the sender
and the request I sent to the Fungusian Network.

"The Fungusian Network?" Dad wrinkled his brow. "Aren't they mushroom
people?"

"They are a fungus life form," I explained. I did not go into their
history. "They are experts in neural networks. Captain Star Runner uses
them to design all ship systems and Star's AI. They have a good working
relationship and I thought it was very likely they would recognize my
name."

"Because you were Star's partner."

"No, because they index Star's data to make data retrieval faster. They
do backups and decide what material can be less readily available. I'm
sure they are well aware of me as a data group."

I realized Star could have requested memories of me might be moved to
less available storage. Star would not delete them, just basically
forget about me. I found this a very painful thought. \<p\<\>"Keep
thinking this way and you'll convince yourself you shouldn't ended
things," I scolded myself. "It wasn't a good match. Exciting, yes, but
not at all beneficial."

And even as I scolded myself, I heard the rationalizations and the lies.
When would all this thinking and going over past incidents stop. Perhaps
it was the nature of this case. I kept bumping into Star all the time.

When we got to the police station, I drank some of that bad coffee and
then regretted it.

## Chapter 13

investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 12

Kearsarge is dead.

her body was found in the intersection of Fifth and elm in the River
District.

Police chief Troy Camberwell asked me to investigate her death. I am
awaiting a review of my contract to-see if i can do this. Dad does not
think i will garner much press attention, especially when the Olympics
conclude and the sports world moves on. I am not so sure. My association
with Captain Star Runner is a juicy enough story and could certainly be
blown all out of proportion.

While I waited at the police station, the autopsy bots analyzed
Kearsarge's body for a cause of death. They concluded she died of a
heart attack but what, if anything, had brought it on was in determined.
Without a complete autopsy, we would not know. Kearsarge did not meet
the criteria for a murder investigation. Because of her address and her
recent assassination, albeit by contract, of her husband made her death
an "expected" one. The Rich and Famous took this risk when they came to
Hypatia. In fact, it was one of the documents they signed when they
stepped onto the Alexandria Space Station. Most did not realize this
since they routinely signed all sorts of documents when entering and
leaving star systems.

My dad simply want to know the players to make his job of policing and
safeguarding the service workers easily. Were there any new players in
town? Had alliances shifted. Was there more here than met the eye?

Personally, I thought so. I did not think her death involved the local
criminal element. If the League of Hypatian Pirates was involved, it was
strictly a contractual agreement.

My link buzzed me.

The legal review gave me the go ahead to continue to investigate. The
contract had a provision under which I was authorized and paid to
investigate Kearsarge's death. In this circumstance, I was to file a
final report to a legal firm on Fair Haven. Presumably they handled
Kearsarge's affairs.

I stood up and was about to find Dad to tell him when my link buzzed
again.

Kearsarge's death had been posted an hour ago. As a result, her legal
firm here in Ptolemy City was advised. Promptly they began executing
Kearsarge's last will and testament. To my absolute and total
astonishment, Kearsarge named me in her will. I now owned her house at
17 Dollar Bay Drive. Further, arrangements were made for an ordinary
person to be able to live there.

I forwarded all this information to my accounting advisor. My immediate
attention to this matter surprised me. It was not the sort of thing I
would have ever thought of several years ago. Captain Star Runner would
have thought about it and done it just as I had just done. A lot of the
Pantheran had rubbed off on me. In this case, it was a very good thing.

For the record, both accountants and legal advisors are highly efficient
and tailored programs. They are overseen by humans but people do not
look at contracts and last wills and testaments. Later the accountant
program would tell me the house on Torch Lake was free of all
encumbrances. Its maintenance fees, although substantial, could be
managed if I invested my whole earnings from Kearsarge's fully paid
contract.

Had Kearsarge expected to die and that made my fee as high as it was?

"Curiouser curiouser," Dad said commented when I told him. "At least you
will be able to get inside the house and look around."""

I said, "Would you like to come."

A smile broke over his worn face.

"You bet I would."

"Shall we go now?"

"Later," he said. "Let's go in the afternoon and then we can go to the
Parge's and bring Simon up-to-date."

"That's a deal," I said. "I need to review some incoming information and
see what the sports world makes of all this. Simon will be on top of
that coverage, but I want to get a feel for what they are saying."

"Good idea," Dad said. "Meet you at three."

## Chapter 14

I walked into my flat and looked around. There was nothing personal here
save a piece of clothing dropped on the settee. I had not realized
before just how disconnected I was from my residence. I always dreamed
of a flat in the Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority. It is safe, a
fashionable address, convenient to the heart of the city. It is also
cold, remote and indifferent to you when you move in with no friends, no
job, and nothing to look forward to. The womyn who can afford to live
here have busy lives and no time to draw out an introvert like me. No
one was rude. They were just courteous enough. All my physical needs for
security and nourishment could be met here, but nothing else. Somehow I
would have to make this space my own or move on. I wondered if 17 Dollar
Bay Drive would be any different. Could that be the simple answer of why
Kearsarge frequented the Elwood Street Diner?

I sat down to review the sports news. I wondered why I had not heard
anything from the Fungusian Network. Was I fooling myself that they
would know who I was and would respond in a timely manner? No matter.
Maybe the messages would have a simple explanation when Dad and I
searched Kearsarge's house.

Not surprisingly, the news channels were alive with chatter about
Kearsarge's death. There was lots of video of Dad explaining her death
as unexplained and explaining why it would not be investigated. The
Solar League people were aghast. Dad explained he did not have the
authority to investigate and they could take their questions to the
Governing Board.

They did and got the same answers. This was Ptolemy City and sudden
death was common enough among the Rich and Famous. So were assassination
contracts. They had no record of an assassination contract for Kearsarge
as a victim, only as a contract holder.

There were video clips of Kearsarge's biggest races. There was precious
little about her background except to say she hailed from Cherry Vale on
Fair Haven.

The current marathon completed without incident. The closing ceremonies
for the Olympics would be held the following evening and then the
off-planet people would leave. I wondered how Kearsarge's death would
influence tourism. Perhaps there would be a down turn for a little
while, but the allure of the Pharaoh Star System is not its safety. In
fact, it is quite the opposite. It is the opportunity for intrigue and
danger which draws people in.

Nothing there to give me a lead. What else could I do?

Of course. I could talk with the people at the Elwood Street Diner.
Perhaps someone there knew something, saw something, had an idea.

"Investigator Camberwell," a man approached me as a left the building. I
hesitated. He was unfamiliar to me and he knew my name and more
disquieting, that I was an investigator. Should I summon the security
officer? (Another feature of the Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority.
I needed to consider that fact seriously before relocating.)

"I don't know you," I said. Did all my conversations with strangers
start this way now?

"Of course you don't," he said, moving his hand as if to brush aside my
remark.

"I'm from the Solar League Examiner."

A reporter then.

"And should I call you Solar League Examiner or do you have a name?" I
asked, thinking what, if anything, I wanted to say to this middle-aged
man.

"I do," he said. "You won't believe it if I tell you though."

"I assume you have a byline," I said.

"Yes, of course, but it's not my name."

"One or the other then or I'm out of here," I said.

"Let's go with Blake Redman," he said, holding out his hand. "My parents
named me Absalom Gebb."

"After the detective?" I asked.

Blake Redman stared at me. "How do you know the Lady From Nowhere?" he
asked.

"A friend of my family is Simon Parge,"" I said.

Blake laughed. "Fair enough," he said.

A camel came by and we climbed aboard.

"Destination," the dispatch AI said.

"Elwood Street," I said. There was no point playing coy. Blake Redman
would contrive to follow me until he got his answer.

"Do the robots listen in?" Redman asked.

"Robots?" I was puzzled.

"You spoke to it just now."

"Oh, that was the dispatch AI," I said. "It doesn't keep a recording of
our conversation after we leave the camel. If you molested me, that
would be another matter. We could not be recorded at all if we each
confirmed that desire to the AI's satisfaction. People do not usually
plan conspiracies in a camel."

"Where do they plan conspiracies," Redman asked.

"On the terrace of Shepheard's Hotel might be a convenient location," I
said. "Ptolemy City is full of plans. Some of them come to pass while
others do not."

"You locals seem quite comfortable with conspiracies and murders."

"They happen all the time," I said. "Working people just go about their
business."

"And would you be a working person?" Redman probed gently.

"Technically no," I said. "I'm not employed as a service worker."

"Investigating isn't a service?"

"Not officially," I said.

"As you can tell, I'm not from around here," Redman said.

"Where are you from?" I asked, more for something to say than any
interest in his answer.

I come from a farming planet," Redman said. "You probably haven't heard
of it."

"Probably not," I agreed. "But your news outlet probably has a location
I have heard of."

"Solar City, of course, but I'm rarely there." Redman"

We got out at the corner of Lower Nile Street and Elwood Street. I
walked toward the diner.

"Where are you going? I don't think I know where we are."

"I'm going to the Elwood Diner," I said. "You can buy me lunch. This is
a working class neighborhood called the River District."

The untidy woman was again behind the counter. \<"Hello, Ronnie," she
boomed. "And who is this handsome man you have in tow?"

"This is Blake, Theresa," I said.

I scanned her board. "I'll have the salad special. Blake's paying."

And with that I walked to the back to the booth Kearsarge and I shared
two days ago when she was very much alive. Long ago Simon and Dad has
disabused of the idea I could change what happened after the fact. I did
not wonder if anything I could have said would have changed the outcome
of Kearsarge lying dead in at Fifth and Elm.

Blake followed me slowly, looking around curiously.

"This place is different than anything around the hotels," he commented.

"It is different than other diners," I said. "It is all human run.
Theresa does the cooking."

"I have noticed that there is very little meat served in Ptolemy City,"
Blake said.

"Where would we put the animals?" I asked. "The atmosphere is poisonous
and there isn't any life here that anyone has found. Of course, no one
has looked very hard. Perhaps they live in volcanoes."

"Don't you worry about your part of the crust sliding into one?" Blake
asked.

"Oh, the surface is moving all the time," I said, "we just have an
infrastructure that takes that into account."

Blake again stared at me. "You are all crazy," he said. "I'll be glad to
back aboard the Alexandria Space Station. I at least have confidence in
that not falling into a volcano."

"Or the North Sea," I said, giving him a wicked grin. "The acids in the
sea would dissolve the station within hours."

"And what do you folks do for fun around here?" Blake said, shuddering
at the picture of a space station dissolving.

"We conspire and we do away with people," I said, remembering our
conversation in the camel.

Theresa brought our drinks.

"Too bad about Kearsarge," Theresa said to me. "Going down to Green Way
Station at night is not a good idea."

"No, it's not," I agreed, sobering quickly. "Did she say anything to you
or anyone here about why she might be there."

"That woman told no one about nothing," Theresa allowed. "You ask me,
she was carrying a burden of trouble. I could never get her to talk
about it. You gonna find out who done it, Ronnie? Word on the street is
that Kearsarge left you money to do that."

So much for keeping a low profile. And so much for keeping this
information from Blake Redman, but I already thought he knew. Why call
me "Investigator Camberwell" and why follow me all the way to the River
District for lunch?

"So what's your interest in Kearsarge?" I asked Blake Redman. "Is it the
sensational aspect of this case."

Blake sipped his coffee as it he had not heard me. He made a face.

"It's not real coffee," I said. "It's synthesized. We can't grow coffee
plants in our vegetable farms."

"This tastes different than what I've had at the hotel," Blake said,
"but it's a lot cheaper."

"The hotel coffee may be real," I said, "it's imported."

Redman put down his coffee cup deliberately.

"You're new at this investigating business, aren't you?" he asked me.

"I'm new as being a private investigator," I said. "I'm former police."

"It's a different game," Redman said. "People don't have to answer your
questions."

"In Ptolemy City, they don't have to answer anything," I said. "We keep
asking anyway."

"Right," Redman said. "Everything is different here. Well, anyway, you
asked a good question about Kearsarge, but you needed to sit on it to
get me to answer you. I'll answer you anyway and I'll give it to you
straight. After all, you knew Absalom Gebb was the Scotland Yard man in
Lady From No Where."

I inhaled the aroma of my tea and waited.

"There's a bigger story here than a marathon runner showing up dead in
an intersection," Redman said. "That is sensational and it will grab the
headlines for a cycle or two. But it happened to a runner who was fading
and it happen far, far away from the Solar League. Other events will
drown it out.

"I've covered that story for the Solar League Examiner. I've tried to
find out why. But I've also been investigating Kearsarge's family on
Fair Haven."

Our food arrived. We spent several minutes eating the hot and fragrant
food. Theresa was a good cook. She made a mean tofu breakfast scramble.

I knew very little about Fair Haven. My in depth background check was
overdue. Maybe Blake Redman could fill me.

"Kearsarge's family lives in Cherry Vale. That's not a town. It's a
royal holding. Do you know what that is?"

"No clue."

"Kearsarge's family is has sword allegiance to the prince of the
Mountain Region. Cherry Vale is a subsection of this princely region."

Note to self: Need a better name than Mountain Region. Stay tuned.

"Kearsarge was married to a lesser relative of Princess Jennifer."

"Samuel Cornelius Mudd," I offered. \<p\<\>"Lord Samuel Cornelius Mudd,"
Redman corrected. "Kearsarge was properly Lady Kearsarge which is why
she went by Kearsarge. She's a York and Mudd is a Bender. These are very
old families on Fair Haven. I don't know why or how Lord Samuel's family
name got changed. It wasn't important to my investigation."

"What exactly are you investigating?" I asked.

"Smuggling," Redman said.

I smiled, pouring more hot water into my cup. "We know all about
smuggling in the Pharaoh Star System."

"Well, you do have the League of Hypatian Pirates. That suggests you
have legalized smuggling."

"Not exactly," I said. "We haven't legalized it. We haven't prohibited
it. There is a difference."

## Chapter 15

Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 14

I learned the sports world was shock by Kearsarge's death but had no
angles for me to pursue.

I am the legal owner of 17 Dollar Bay Drive. I have enough money
designated by Kearsarge for its upkeep. Dad and I will go through the
house at 3 pm.

"What have you found out so far?"

I thought Blake Redman might not answer my question because i was being
so direct. Again he surprised me.

"The York family is definitely engaged in smuggling goods from Fair
haven into the Coalition. I have good documentation on that. What is not
clear at all is whether the Bender family is involved. I rather think
they are. Why else would a younger lord of the realm marry one of their
daughters???""

"Ass an alliance" I suggested.

"What would be in it for the Benders?"

"Access?"?"

""To what?"

"A piece of the action, suppliers, buyers, routes, corrupt officials?"

"possibly. I think it is more likely that the Yorks learned something
about the Benders they could use as leverage."

""Blackmail then??"

"Precisely."

Two things came to mind which Emily Dickinson told me.

1.     He owed someone big time so he had to come back to Hypatia to
execute the assassination contract.

2.     he warned me off of getting involved with Kearsarge because of
some undefined danger to me and possibly him.

3.     Emily Dickinson called Kearsarge a bitch.\
\

Then another thought occurred to me. How did I know the person across
from me was either Absalom Gebb, Blake Redman or someone who meant me
harm?

"And you are telling me all of this because ..."

"You are an investigator looking into matters for Lady Kearsarge,"
Redman said. "I thought you might have some information that would help
me."

"Clearly it is you who have all the information," I said.

"My information is not specific," Redman explained. "It is about
families. It is not about individuals and it is not up-to-the-minute."

"And you think I have that kind of information?" I asked.

"I think you will discover this information," Redman said.

"And why should I share it with you?"

My tone was sharp which surprised me. I think of myself as easy-going,
live and let live, that sort of thing.

"I thought you would be on the side of justice," Redman said. "Smuggling
is illegal."

"Not here in the Pharaoh Star System." I pointed out. "The League of
Hypatian Pirates operates out in the open. You can walk right into their
offices."

"But I doubt they'll talk to me about my investigation."

"Have you asked them?" I asked him.

"No, I haven't."

"Why not?"

I didn't realize you could just walk up to a real pirate and interview
them."

"They might not talk," I said. "But you never know. I suggest we catch a
camel and pop right over there."

"You're on," Redman said. He was excited.

Personally, I doubted anyone at the League would talk to him, but then
again, they might. I figured the pirates would do a pretty good job of
vetting Mr. Blake Redman and then I would know if he was legitimate or
not.

We did indeed catch a camel and found the offices of the League in the
Warehouse District.

Captain William Kidd lounged at the desk when we entered.

"Hello, Ronnie," he greeted me. "It's been a long time."

"Hello, William," I said. "How have you been?"

"So-so," he said. "Not being off-planet gets boring, but at my time of
life, you take what you can get, and a job here at headquarters isn't
bad. You're better looking than your brother, you know."

I smiled. No matter how many times I told Captain Kidd I was a lesbian,
he always talked about me being what he called "all girl". For the
record, I'm not pretty. I d not dress up and I am definitely not dainty.

""Captain Kidd," I said, "this is Blake Red from the Solar League
Examiner. He wants to talk to you about some investigative reporting he
is doing. Would you be willing to talk to him?"

"Well now, Ronnie, that all depends," Captain Kidd said. "He has to be
who he says he is and then I have to hear what he is asking."

"Fair enough," Redman said.

He produced an identification tag. Captain Kidd placed it in a reader.
That seemed like very old technology to me. When I said this Redman
explained.

"The codes are nearly impossible to replicate. The readers work on all
sorts of planets including those who do not want to progress past a
certain technological level."

"Well, you do work for the Solar League Examiner," Captain Kidd said. "I
verified via link that you are doing the work you claim to be doing. Now
what are your questions?"

"You want me to ask you right here in the reception area?" Red man
asked.

"It's as good a place as any. If you want a chair, just pull one over
here to my desk."

We complied. I wondered if Captain Kidd would tell Redman anything.

"I'm investigating smuggling which has a connection to the planet Fair
Haven," Blake Redman said. "Can you comment on that."

"Fair haven?" Captain Kidd asked. "Where would that be?"

"Near the Coalition border on the Southern Frontier."

"Ah yes, Fair Haven." Captain Kidd spoke in a drawl. I had no idea where
he hailed from originally though I knew he operated out of the Pharaoh
Star System for many years until he became afraid to go into space. I
had never learned what caused his fear. It was likely to be some near
death experience-- a fire, lack of food, drifting in space for a long
time before rescue, the loss of a crew, even bankruptcy.

Captain Kidd cleared this throat. I waited for his press release voice.

"The League of Hypatian Pirates does not engage in illegal smuggling
activities within Coalition space."

I interrupted the rest of the speech, "We know that, Captain Kidd. What
Mr. Redman wants to talk to you about is any League activity you are
free to discuss involving Fair Haven, the York or Bender families or any
knowledge you might have individually about these matters."

If I did not interrupt him, Captain Kidd could talk for hours about
nothing with many digressions into old stories and never get to the
point. He was an excellent choice for the League to put out front. But
now and hen he could produce a piece of information which was helpful.
Talking to the League also allowed the League to clarify points without
being explicit. They often passed tips to the police if a matter needed
looking into or if they wanted to distance themselves from one
individual or another.

"The York family," Captain Kidd gave every impression of trying to
remember. I saw the tell. He knew exactly who they were and was buying
some time before he spoke.

"The Yorks are a nasty bunch of folks," Captain Kidd said. "They like to
double cross people. That makes them difficult to deal with, you
understand?"

"So I've heard," Redman said. "Can you be specific?"

"I'm afraid not," Captain Kidd said, "that might embarrass a irate or
two around here."

"What can you tell me about the Bender family."

"Never heard of them," Captain Kidd said, but there was another tell.

"Do you know anything about Kearsarge's death?" I asked.

"Now I heard you would be the one to ask about that," Captain Kidd
drawled. I did not see any tell.

"Is it something the League is interested in?" I asked.

"We would be interested to know if there was a contract and it wasn't
registered," Captain Kidd assured me.

"I'd be interested in that, too." I said, standing up. It was getting
late and I needed to meet Dad. Besides, I did not think I would get any
more out of Captain Kidd today, at least not while Blake Redman was
present. "If you hear anything, Captain Kidd, you be sure to let me
know."

"I'll contact you if I hear anything I can pass on."

"Fair enough," I said, "and pass some things on you can't pass on as
well."

"Now you know I can't do that," Captain Kidd said.

"Sure you can," I said airily and blew him a kiss as I left the
building.

I do not remember when I started doing that to Captain Kidd, but it
always made the old man smile.

"That was not particularly helpful," Blake Redman said as we waited for
another caravan.

"I thought it was extremely helpful," I said.

"How?"

"First, I found out you really are who you say you are. Secondly, he
does know something about the Yorks. Their character at least is known
even here and the League doesn't mind spreading that information around.
That might suggest someone in the city might talk. You'll need to hang
out at some of the pirate bars tonight and see who will talk."

"And where would they be?"

"In this district," I said. "I'd try Long John Silver's or the Treasure
Chest. They're safe enough and hey have enough people in them to get a
story going."

We climbed aboard an elephant with several other passengers. Redman gave
his hotel address. He was staying at the Palace Hotel. I gave my flat's
address, but after Redman got off, I alighted at the Interplanetary
Hotel and switched to a gazelle to get me to Dollar Bay Drive by three
o'clock.

It was a long drive out to Torch Lake. I was looking forward to a
restful ride when my link signaled. At last! The message from the
Fungusians arrived.

From The Fungusian Network, Ministry of Networking Protocols, Solar
League Conventions, IRQSWX792, Dennis

To: Investigator Ronnie Camberwell, FKA Detective Ronnie Camberwell, AKA
Veronica Camberwell, etc.

Subject: Your Request Dated ---- (fill in the date here)

We anticipated getting back to you sooner; however, the protocol above
required more investigation than the initial estimates provided.

The messages you inquired a                               bout are being
sent from the Terran planet Fair Haven on the Southern Frontier. These
messages can be traced using the attached protocols. We recommend a
professional. We understand you are in contact with Josh Hardy and
Associates. This firm can remove the block for you and make further
inquiries as you wish.

It has been a pleasure to work for you and if we can be of help in the
future, please do not hesitate to contact us.

And that was it.

I forwarded the message to Josh and asked him what he thought of the
memorandum and the attached specifications.

I wondered how long my good friend Dennis would be around.

"That particular Dennis won't be around Lon," Susan said. I was rubbing
my wrist again. I needed to be more careful about that and I needed to
talk with Susan more.

"But you need not worry. All the Fungusians who occupy that position in
the network will be called Dennis, at least when corresponding with
humans. You can just keep on thinking of him as Dennis and all will be
well."

"All roads lead to Fair Haven," I said.

"Indeed they do," Susan said. "You can find out if there is any
information left at Kearsarge's house that will help you."

"I am beginning to wonder how much longer Should pursue this case. From
all I hear, the Yorks are not nice people."

"What you need to find out is: Are you in any danger because you are
working for a York," Susan said.

"How did you get so smart?" I asked. "You told me you were not an AI."

"I have a special subroutine for dangerous situations. Usually such
dangers are financial or physical like an amusement park ride when you
have a bad heart," Susan said. "You simply exceeded the number of pieces
of information that said the York family is dangerous and you are
working for a York family member."

I thought about that. Would I be swept up in the operation that killed
Kearsarge. Was she killed in retaliation for the assassination contract
she took out on her husband? I had assumed so. Was something else
possible? Could it be a competitor of the Yorks which the Benders,
possible, were not?

"I hope I don't have to travel to Fair Haven," I said.

"You will have to evaluate that possibility at a future date," Susan
said.

How unhelpful. I turned her off. Maybe talking to her was not a good
idea after all.

I definitely needed a sounding board. I would have to find someone
quick. Could Simon Parge or even Blake Redman fill that role?

My link buzzed. A voice call.

"Josh," I said.

"Hey, girl friend," Josh said. "That message was so cool. A Fungusian
who signs his name Dennis. And his attachment was so simple. I've never
seen anything like it before."

"Can you do it?" I asked.

"Do it? I've already done it. I've filed this baby away. The protocol is
simple, secure and no one else will know how to crack it for a while.
You really gave me an edge, Ronnie."

"Now can you trace those messages?"

"Already working on it, girl friend."

"Remember where you got those protocols from," I said.

"I never forget," Josh assured me. "And just think, the Fungusians not
only know who I am, they think I do good work."

"They think you can follow directions." I corrected him.

"Same thing," Josh said and hung up before I could make another
impertinent retort.

4.     ## Chapter 16

5.     Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 15

Blake Redman and I questioned Captain William Kidd at the League of
Hypatian Pirates. Captain Kidd confirmed that the York family were
smugglers, brining goods into the Solar League across the Coalition
border. He described the family as nasty. Otherwise, we could get no
information out of him though I suspect he knows more than he is
telling. I'm not sure how to get more information out of him right now.

The Fungusians sent me the information so Josh Hardy could remove the
block on his trace. The Fungusians indicated the messages were coming
from Fair Haven. I am leaving it to Josh to learn more.

I sent Redman to the bars to check out what the spacers knew about the
smuggling operations on Fair Haven. He agreed to meet me for lunch
tomorrow at the Elwood Street Diner to share with me what he learned.

I did not tell him I was going to Kearsarge's house on Dollar Bay Drive.
I will share what I think applies to his investigation when I see him.

\* \* \*

Dollar Bay Drive was awesome. The houses were five stories high with
flitter landing pads on top. This left an amazing amount of space free
and open to the dome. Garden areas adjoined the landing pad with patios
so people could sit there and enjoy the unobstructed view of the
Hypatian landscape.

Each house had land all around it with plainsman. It was like having
your own park to yourself.

The houses were painted with distinctive murals. All of Ptolemy City's
buildings are painted this way, even the structures in the seediest
neighborhoods. (Granted, the paint is not renewed as often there as the
population depends on the whim of the Governing Board.) The paint breaks
down toxic elements in the environment. Here on Dollar Bay Drive, people
used the paint to make each house distinctive. There were scenes from
other planets, fanciful pictures of dragons, old-fashioned ground
vehicles, stripes, plaids, and some solid colors with contrasting trim.

Kearsarge's house, my house, pictured a mountain landscape. Perhaps this
reflected her home on Fair Haven. As I studied the mural from the garden
in front, I realized the mountains were snow-capped. The snow was white.
The snow on Hypatia is red. It is blown about by intense winds. This
snow seemed to be stationary and laying on the ground. It looked quite
pretty.

"Are you going to gawk all afternoon?" Dad asked, coming up behind me.

I jumped.

"Don't scare me like that." I said. It came out more as an accusation
than an admission that I had not heard him approach from his caravan.

"Don't get so engrossed in the scenery then." His tone was mildly
scolding.

"It's just pretty," I said.

"It's quite alien, isn't it," Dad said, giving it a closer inspection.
"It must be like home."

"That's what I'm thinking. Blake Redman says she came from a
principality called the Mountain Region.

"And Blake Redman would be?"

"A reporter from the Solar League Examiner," I said. "He's investigating
smuggling on Fair Haven."

"Let's go inside," Dad said decisively. "No telling who's watching or
listening. You can tell me more when the house surveillance is on. Do
you have the codes."

"You bet," I said.

Getting clearance from the house to enter was a laborious procedure
which included fingerprints, a retina scan, a voice print and a one
hundred and twenty-eight digit password. When I completed all these
steps, the house said, "Welcome to your new home, Ronnie," and finally
opened the door.

"House," I said when Dad closed the door behind us, "do you have verbal
input and output." \<

"Yes," the house said in a rich male voice. "I am called Arthur. If you
would prefer to call me something else--"

"Not necessary," I said. "Arthur is just fine."

"Thank you, Ronnie. I may call you Ronnie?"

"That's fine," I said. "Arthur, this is my father, Troy Camberwell. He
is Ptolemy City's police chief. You may let him into the house whether I
am present or not. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Ronnie. Your wishes are noted."

"Who else has permission to enter?" I asked.

"Lady Kearsarge, Lord Samuel and three others."

"Delete Lady Kearsarge and Lord Samuel. They're dead and will no longer
come in and out of the house. Who are the others?"

"I cannot give you their names," Arthur said. "They were never given
identities."

"How did you identify them?"

"By voice prints, retina scans and fingerprints."

"Did they receive a password?"

"No. They needed to have an appointment to enter."

"Is there any way for me to learn who they are?"

"I can show you a hologram of them," Arthur said.

"That's very good thinking." I praised Arthur. AIs, even rudimentary
ones, love praise.

"A visual identification is always helpful," Arthur said. "I recognized
you when you got out of the gazelle. Your father was known to me as a
city official.

"Very good," I said. "Where can we see the holograms?"

On the second level rear," Arthur said.

"We will go there directly," I said, looking for the stairs. There were
none.

The bounce tube is 10 meters ahead of you," Arthur said helpfully.

"Thank you," I said.

Dad had been quiet all this time. He said, "Where did you learn how to
talk to a computer that way?"

"Years of talking to Captain Star Runner's AI," I said.

"It feels a little creepy," Dad commented as we walked toward what I
assumed was the bounce tube.

"They watch everything. They listen to everything," I said, but you sort
of get used to it. They can tell you where you put something when you
don't remember where you set it down."

"What is a bounce tube?" Dad asked.

"It's a sort of people mover," I said. "I've only used one off-planet. A
cushion of air lifts and lowers you."

"And it's safe?"

"I assume so," I said. "Do you want me to go first?"

"NO," my dad said.

I expected he would not want me to ink he was afraid.

We negotiated the bounce tube easily and walked into a large room. Its
windows were covered with a privacy screen. Holograms of three people,
two women and a man, stood waiting for us.

"Oh my goodness," Dad said. "I know them. Do you recognize them,
Ronnie?"

"They look familiar," I said.

"This man is the head of mining operations on Mark Antony, Charlie
Dayton."

"That makes sense," I said. "Sam Mudd managed the mines."

"Of course," Dad said.

"Delete this one's access," I said, "but don't delete anything else
right now. All his data should be retained under the name Charlie
Dayton."

"OK." Arthur responded promptly. "Done."

"These two," Dad said, "are well-known criminals. They're Peppermint
Patty Parine and Dagger Dan Duncan."

"Now I remember," I said. "What are they doing with access to this
house?"

Arthur decided I was speaking to him and proceeded to give me an answer.

"They discussed business with Lady Kearsarge."

"Provide my link, Susan, with a summary," I said. "Can you do that?"

"Ye, but it will take several hours."

"Start working on it immediately. I may need answers to a number of
questions so leave processing capability to answer."

"Yes, Ronnie."

"Ronnie," Arthur said a moment later.

"Yes, Arthur."

"I have a message for you."

"From whom?"

"From Lady Kearsarge. She said I was to play it for you when u came to
the house."

"Tell me," I said.

"It's a holo." Arthur said.

"Show me," I said. Arthur was being pedantic.

Kearsarge appeared. My father gasped beside me. I did not look at him.
Kearsarge was dressed in a floor length gown of some filmy material. It
was white and left very little to the imagination. The garment, dress or
nightwear I could not tell, even had a hood which covered her
short-cropped light brown hair. The sleeves billowed as she spoke, her
hands clenched. I do not know what my father saw. I never asked him. To
my eye, she was not attractive. Her body was hard and unforgiving. That
was a word that just popped into my mind. Maybe her body reflected on
the outside what was on the inside. Maybe I just made that up based on
what Blake Redman and Emily Dickinson had told me.

"Ronnie, I'm so scared. I got another message. It said -- it said I
would be dead by morning. Find out who is sending these messages. I told
Arthur to give you anything you need. That's why I'm giving you the
house. I'm supposed to be resting, getting ready for the marathon
tomorrow -- I mean, later today, but I just can't sleep. I want to win
this race to prove to everyone I am not a loser. I think they know that
and that's why they're sending me all these messages, to keep me from
winning. But I'll show them. I really will."

And that was it. She did not sound convinced. I expected her to stamp
her foot, but she did not. She just stared and looked very vulnerable
and scared. I wondered if she had ever felt that way before. Everything
was hard about this woman except her nuisance that she was scared. I
believed her. She really had been scared.

"What time was this recorded?" I asked Arthur.

"two thirty in the morning."

"And her body was reported at four forty-five," Dad said.

"When did she leave the house, Arthur?" I asked.

"Three seventeen a.m.," Arthur said.

"Did she leave alone?"

"Yes."

"How did she travel?"

"She called for a caravan."

I turned to Dad. "Can we get caravan records?"

He shook his head. "They would be sealed," he said, "sorry. I can't get
them for you."

"It would tell us where she went," I persisted.

"I would but you know the Transit Authority holds that information
close."

I did know. It was a lot of red tape to get transit records even in a
criminal investigation and so far, this was not a criminal
investigation.

Something about this did not feel right. I opened my mouth to say
something to Arthur and then I had a chilling thought. What if Arthur
had been tampered with? I had fallen so quickly into the mind set that
he cold be trusted. This was not Christabel, Star's AI. This was an
unknown quantity.

I intentionally turned Susan on.

"Hi, Ronnie," she said in her perky voice.

"Susan," I said, cutting across her standard greeting. "When was the
last time you received a security update?"

"My system is up-to-date," Susan announced.

"That's not what I asked you," I said, my fear making me impatient.
"When was your wet wiring last updated for security?"

"Thirty-seven minutes ago," Hausa said.

"Thank you, Susan. In future, please answer the question I ask and then
provide other information as needed in your judgment."

"Yes, Ronnie, I'll do that."

"Now send a priority message to Josh Hardy asking him to do a deep scan
of Arthur's systems. I need him to do it as soon as possible."

"OK, Ronnie. Message sent."

"Good. Keep listening but be quiet unless I need, I mean really need, to
hear something important."

I was babbling. What kind of an instruction was that to a link, even a
top-of the-line link like Susan.

"OK, Ronnie," Susan said.

"Arthur, you heard that. Allow Josh Hardy access to all our systems. Be
cooperative. Hold noting back."

"Yes, Ronnie," Arthur said. "Is Josh hardy a trusted person?"

"Absolutely," I said. "He can enter the house, too."

That was a bit risky. Josh could show up uninvited and get in. It was a
risk I would have to take given the current situation of this case.

I felt drained.

"I've been thinking," Dad said when everything had been quiet for a few
minutes. "If Peppermint Patty and Dagger Dan are involved, there could
be some real danger. To my way of thinking, they're the ones who could
have killed Kearsarge.

"The other thing I'm worried about," he went on, "is that you sent that
reporter to the Treasure Chest. That's where they drink."

I checked the time. "It's still early," I said. "He won't have left yet.
I told him not to turn up before ten. It's only five now. Let's see if
there is anything else to discover here in the house. Then I'll message
him. I have to figure out what to tell him."

"Can you trust him?" my dad asked.

"I have no idea," I said. "So far, Figure I can trust you, Josh, and the
Parges."

"Kevin, too," Dad said, always willing to take Kevin's side.

"Kevin, too." I begrudged Kevin my trust, but he is my brother.\
\

We walked through the house, but we didn't find anything much. The
flitter was parked on its pad. The automated systems of the house kept
the rooftop garden watered. I supposed they kept the park around the
house watered, too. It did not rain in Ptolemy City.

Dad and I paused on the roof to look out on Torch Lake. We saw a few
sailboats and a number of rowboats. I saw several small craft tied up at
the dock. I have no idea how to operate watercraft.

Kevin does," I thought. "I wonder if Josh does."

That was a comforting thought. Maybe Josh and I could revive our
pre-pubescence friendship. I think Josh asks me out not so much as a
date -- Josh knows me better than that -- but because he does not know
any other way for a man to be friends with a woman. I want to change
that. We will never be lovers. The thought of us together in bed is too
amusing even to be considered. But I desperately need friends and Josh
has been willing to help me with this improbable case.

"If we're going to make dinner at the Parge's, we better get
going," Dad said. "It's a long ride to Pimlico from here."

## Fracas at the Treasure Chest

     Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 16

Kearsarge prearranged for her house AI Arthur to admit me.

I am having Josh Hardy check Arthur out.

Arthur identified three people as having access to the house:

1.     Charlie Dayton, the mine chief executive officer.

2.     Posthumous Patty Parine

3.     Dagger Dan somebody (I can't remember his name at the moment)

These last two are known criminals who exceed even Ptolemy City law at
times.

I warned Blake Redman about these two as they frequent the Treasure
Chest. His questions there could promote a confrontation.

Kearsarge left me a holo in which she says she received a message saying
she would be dead by morning. She said she was scared.

I still have no idea what prompted her to leave the house and how she
ended up in Green Way Station.

## Dinner at the Parges

 

"Well there you have it," Simon Parge said after dinner from the
confines of his contra-gravity chair. "Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan
Somebody knocked her off. You'll never prove it. But that's what
happened."

"But it makes no sense," I protested.

"It doesn't have to make any sense," Simon said with great finality.
"Criminals don't act rationally. You're looking for a reasonable
explanation to something that isn't reasonable."

"I think Ronnie has a point," Dad said in his non-confrontational
manner. "Either Sam Mudd or Kearsarge gave those two access to the
house. Why? No call was recorded from either of them at that late hour.
How reasonable is it to expect that Kearsarge would leave her Dollar Bay
Drive residence and travel to Green Way Station to meet either or both
of them? Wouldn't she call them to come to her?"

"Perhaps she knew they wouldn't come," Simon said. "Perhaps she liked
hanging out in dangerous places. I'd call this a wrap and move on. Talk
to them if you like, Ronnie, but you won't get anything out of it. Just
call the case done and enjoy your good fortune."

That was not the way I operated. I certainly did not think this case was
at an end. I had a bad feeling about it -- that there was something none
of us knew.

"Incoming message," Susan announced

Everyone looked at me. Wet wiring of this sort was still quite rare in
Ptolemy City.

"My link," I explained lamely. "Yes, Susan, what is it?"

I assumed it was Josh. Who else would send me a message?

But it was not Josh.

"Message sender unknown. Message reads: Stop all investigations or you
will die just like Kearsarge did. Remember the intersection of Fifth and
Elm."

No one moved. No one said anything. The spoken message in Susan's voice
hung in the air.

"I told you not to get involved, Ronnie," Simon said, breaking the awful
silence.

Simon always did have to justify himself. I had been surprised he was
not wangling for a part of my fee. It may be because he is not used to
the private investigation business.

"I told her to get involved," Dad said, more forcefully than he usually
did in Simon's presence.

While they spoke, I sent Josh the message and all the particulars Susan
had on it. I suspected the message came from the same source as all the
others.

Josh messaged me back almost instantly.

"I'm working on this as fast as I can. Even with the Fungusian
protocols, it is very slow going. BE CAREFUL!"

"Are you armed?" Dad asked.

"No," I said. "Up until now, I had no reason to be armed."

"I think that's your first order of business," Dad said. "You need to be
able to protect yourself."

"Against what?" I asked. "We don't even know how Kearsarge died."

"Some new kind of weapon," Simon grumbled. "That's the problem with law
enforcement here in the city. We're always one or two steps behind the
criminal element."

"This isn't a law enforcement matter," I said. "It is a private one
between me and Kearsarge's killer. We don't fall under the jurisdiction
of the Ptolemy police department."

Both my father and Simon Parge were quiet. This situation had never
happened before. Both their families had always been considered service
worker families. My new status made each of them uncertain how to
proceed.

"We need more enforcement around here," Simon grumbled.

"It won't happen, Simon," Dad said. "And it's irrelevant. Ronnie's
threat comes from a source which is both unknown and not even bothering
to conform to Hypatian norms."

"There's no assassination contract here," I heard myself say. "This is a
warning. If I walk away and don't ask any more questions, that will be
the end of the matter. I think, to that extent, I can trust the sender
of the message. If I stay away from them, they'll stay away from me."

"And you want to live like that?" Simon asked.

"Of course not," I said. "But everything they've done is legal in
Ptolemy City."

"You still need to protect yourself," Dad said.

"Susan is checking out options now," I said.

I consulted the list of possibilities. Dad leaned over to see the
virtual screen Susan popped up for me. Simon was unable to see the
screen because of where he was sitting. He shifted restlessly in his
chair, unwilling to move it for a better angle but being irritated he
could not see.

"I like this one," I said, pointing.

"Expensive," Dad said.

"Worth it," I said. "It has a good energy chagrin and it stays charged
Lora long while. I'm not planning on using it. I'm just planning on
carrying it."

"What?" Simon demanded.

"Ray Gun 702," I said, not telling him any of the specifications. "It is
available now for pick up so I'm off to get it."

"I'll come with you," Dad said. "I don't want anything to happen to you
before you have it and know how to use it."

We got up off the couch.

"See you, Simon," I said from the doorway. I quickly found Mrs. Parge at
her kitchen table.

"Bye, dear," she said. "It's always good to see you."

"Thanks for dinner," I said. "It was delicious."

"I'm so glad you enjoyed it," Mrs. Parge said.

I wondered, for perhaps the first time, how pro forma our conversations
were. When had we stopped talking to each other about anything
consequential? Was it when I told her about Star and me? Or had I been
kidding myself for a long time. Did these people care about me at all?
Or was it just my mood? Would Simon tell her about the threatening
message? Would he tell her it was my fault? Would she believe him? Did I
care?

I was very pleased that Dad wanted to go with me to the delivery locker
on Lake Memphis Drive. I would be fairly safe in a caravan. The lockers
boasted extra security cameras and robo guards. Still, I could be
vulnerable. Would getting a weapon constitute not dropping the case?
Would it be perceived as provoking my unknown antagonists?

Dad got the call just before we reached the delivery lockers.

My brother Kevin said, "There's a fracas at the Treasure Chest. An
off-world journalist is involved. Does that mean I need to investigate?"

"Absolutely," Dad said.

We jumped out of the caravan. I dashed to the locker, punched in my
one-time code and retrieved the ray gun. As promised, it was fully
charged. We hailed another caravan and jumped in, giving the address of
the Treasure Chest. Keven would beat us there but there was not much he
could do on his own.

"Is Blake Redman covered under a service worker designation?" I asked
Dad.

"He works for a living," Dad says. "He has to go into difficult places
to do his job. I would think a writer for the Solar League Examiner
could broadly be interrupted as a service worker."

We did not have such news organizations in Ptolemy City. There were
people who published information on the neural net, but it was a very
informal arrangement. I made a non-verbal note to Susan to remind me to
check in with The Czarina. She might have some interesting tidbits. She
worked with Captain Star Runner when Star needed some information. Maybe
she would share with me, too.

Maybe, too, I could go back to Emily Dickinson. I knew a bit more about
the players.

When we got to the Treasure Chest on Hubbard Avenue, the brawl was in
full mayhem. Patrons turned over tables, chairs and each other with
great abandon. Glasses and pitchers of beer were either smashed or
poured over someone's head before being smashed. I saw one familiar
pirate both pour and then smash a glass on someone else's head. Another
pirate happily poured his beer on his own head. The fracas seemed more a
celebration of destruction than a an altercation. I wondered that the
police were summoned.

Dad found Kevin in the office with Captain William Kidd and Blake
Redman. Blake was holding a drinks napkin to his face. It was soaked in
blood.

"Hello there, Ronnie," Captain Kidd drawled when he saw me. "I dragged
your friend out of a situation." He grinned. "Posthumous Patty took
exception to something he said. She took out her laser cuter and you
know how she likes to play with it."

Dad said to Kevin, "What happened?"

"This guy," Kevin said, indicating Blake Redman, "started asking
questions. He's a reporter from the Solar League Examiner, or so he
says. Some folks took a dim view of him butting into their business. He
was talking to Dagger Dan Somebody and Posthumous Patty started waving
her laser cutter around. A few pirates challenged her right to do that
at the Treasure Chest. You know Animal Andy prohibits displays of
weapons in his bar. It got ugly fast and Captain Kidd pulled this
reporter up off the floor before he got trampled."

Reasonable," my dad said. "Good work, Kidd. I'd probably have to
investigate if anything more serious happened. Who is Andy going to
charge for the disruption?"

"He's hollering about everybody throwing in their share. He likes a
rumpus just as much as the next pirate. He'll have it all sorted in a
bit."

"Me," said Captain Kidd, "I'm slipping out the back. It's all too much
excitement for a man of my age."

And with that, he left.

"Dad next turned to Redman,"Do you need medical care? I can send you
over to urgent care."

"I should go," Redman admitted. "I haven't been involved in a brouhaha
like this in a very long time. I'm quite out of practice, sad to say."

I looked around the barroom. Animal Andy directed the remaining patrons
to mop, sweep up glass, right the tables and chairs. When everything was
basically back to normal, he'd provide a round and the good times would
roll again. I did not see either Posthumous Patty or Dagger Dan. Too
bad. I wanted to talk with them and this was the only place I knew they
frequented. Finding out where they flopped would be nigh impossible.
Pirates kept their residences, even if it was only a bed in a dormitory,
quite close to the chest.

I went back to the office.

"I can go with Redman," I told Dad. "Just let Urgent Care know we're
coming."

"That's fine," Dad said. "You'll be okay?"

He meant "would I be safe?" I said "Yes" and Red and I got into a
caravan.

"Well that didn't turn out very well," Redman admitted. "I thought my
interviewing skills were more subtle. I didn't expect someone to pull
out a laser cutter in a bar. Glad that old guy from the League office
was there. I think I'd be a goner if he hadn't grabbed me."

"Welcome to Ptolemy City," I said. "It's a mix of the frontier and the
playground for the Rich and Famous. Anything can happen and probably
will, sooner or later. Did you get anything helpful?"

"Dagger Dan told me he was not at liberty to comment on any question I
might want to put to him. That's a direct quote."

"And Posthumous Patty?"

"She came out swinging. She didn't bother to confirm or deny anything?"

"Anybody else say anything?"

"Nope. I saw them and went over to their table. I figured I'd buy them a
drink and we'd talk some before I asked them anything, but they started
reacting as soon as I got to the table. I never sat down."

"We'll need to look into them a little more thoroughly," I said. I
wasn't thinking of Redman.

"Are we cooperating then?" he asked.

I thought this over. "It might work," I said. "Let's get you fixed up
first."

Dad had called ahead so there was no difficulty getting Redman seen to.
We left there and went to the Palace Hotel.

"You mind coming up to my room?" Redman asked.

"So long as we're just going to talk about the case," I said.

"I don't mix business with pleasure," Redman said. "Besides, you're not
my type."

With that settled, we rode up in the conventional elevator to the sixth
floor. Redman's room overlooked one of Ptolemy City's many parks. I
forget off-hand which one.

"So," Redman said when I finished updating him, "someone is still
sending the messages. Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan aren't talking.
Has your tech guy gotten back to you with anything?"

I had not noticed if I received any messages. I checked. There were two
from Josh, the second one sounded urgent. I realized he must think I was
in danger, dead or otherwise unable to answer. I asked Susan to ramp up
the notification signals and messaged Josh immediately. We set up a
voice link.

"Ronnie, I was panicked you didn't answer," Josh said when I was
connected.

"I'm sorry about that," I said. "Things got a little busy at the
Treasure Chest. I'm here with Blake Redman. We're trying to figure out
what to do next."

"I'll be over," Josh said. "I want to share with you what I've found
out."

9.     "That would be great," I said. "The more minds working on this
the better."

10.   ## Chapter 18

11.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 17

Note to Self: It occurs to me that this story line does not follow day
by day so this title is a bit misleading. As I revise, the time frame
will either expand or the case notes will be framed in a different way.
It is convenient to recap before I start another chapter.

I bought a ray gun for protection after I received message from an
unknown source warning me off my investigation.

I have few leads other than this.

Simon Parge concluded the case is finished, but I don't think so,
especially after receiving this message.

Blake Redman was involved in an altercation at the Treasure Chest when
he approached Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan. He escaped serious injury
because Captain Kidd pulled him out of the melee which ensued.

Blake Redman, Josh hardy and I have convened at Blake's room in the
Palace Hotel to plan a strategy. We need to get to the bottom of this
case. Speed seems important.

 

"I'm running all the scans I can think of," Josh said after he arrived.
His hair was sticking out all over. He was dressed in a teeshirt with a
picture of a ghoul on it and pants of an indeterminate color. Perhaps
they had been gray once, but most of the color had leeched out from
multiple washings. His trainers were developing a pattern of tiny hold
and there was already a rip at the edge of the sole near his big toe on
his right foot. This was the Josh I knew and loved. It was good to see
him emerge from the up-to-date businessman I met earlier. My confidence
soared.

"Have you turned up anything?" Blake asked.

"Some things," Josh said. Turning to me, "Ronnie, it was good you
thought to scan the house bot. There's a lot of code I don't understand
in his subroutines. I've walled them off for now and I've set
notifications if there is any attempt to run them. I'm also working my
way through the call logs, text, video and voice. I'm hoping to find out
who Kearsarge and Sam Mudd talked to and what about.

"The most disturbing item I've come across is an encrypted message sent
when you and your dad entered the house. The encryption is very
sophisticated. I think of myself as a very good hacker with very good
tools. This is Ptolemy City after all. It's the game we all play here.
Yet I'm having no success. I've never seen anything like it before and
I've worked on some pretty advanced systems."

"Could the Fungusians help?" I asked. "We now have a contact."

Josh scowled. I was suggesting he was incompetent, but time mattered
here.

"It's a thought," he said slowly. "But I don't know how much time we
have."

"The sooner we send that off the quicker they can respond," Blake said,
sensing that Josh and I were at an impasse. "Don't think of this as a
slight against your hacking skills. Look at it as an opportunity to
learn how to encrypt this way. Ronnie has an in with the Fungusian
Network. Don't throw that away, man. Humans don't get an opportunity
like that often."

"As a matter of interest, Ronnie, how did you manage it?"

"I knew a captain who worked with them," I said, choosing my words
carefully. If Blake had researched me as well as I thought he had, he
would know who I was speaking about, but he simply nodded.

"OK," Josh said, using our side conversation to search his soul to see
if it was ethical to bring in the Fungusian Network when a hack was in
danger of failing and his client and best friend was at risk. "I'll send
the info off to Dennis to see what the Fungusians make of it. Maybe
he'll be as trilled with this as he was with the message tracing block
you sent him earlier."

"When do you think you'll now anything from your scans?" Blake asked
Josh.

"Not for several hours," Josh said. "My systems are state-of-he-art and
very fast, but there's a lot of data.

"Do you have any more information you can share with us?" I asked Blake,
sensing that I was losing control of the conversation and thus my
investigation. It is after all, my investigation.

"I've put out feelers on how both the Benders and the Yorks are treating
the deaths of both Lord Mudd and Lady Kearsarge," Blake said. "My
initial responses are from the media which, I am sure you are not
surprised to learn, is very pro royal. These deaths are "tragic" and
"unfortunate", "cut down in their prime", that sort of thing. I'm trying
to get the true family reaction. That's easier to get on the ground, but
as I am not on Fair Haven and not likely to be there any tie soon, I'm
relying on local journalists. They have to be very, very careful as the
royals take a dim view of reporters sniffing around them to get
sensational headlines."

"So you're not leaving here to go there right now," Josh said.

Blake's smile was sardonic. "I'm a persona non gratis on Fair Haven," he
said. "I ask too many questions and I've gotten on-the-record interviews
from too many people. No, when I leave Ptolemy City, I'll be heading
back to the Solar League. I want to be sure the Coalition lets me back
in. My pass will expire in twenty-four hours. If I'm not off Hypatia by
then, I'm not going anywhere."

"So what can you do before then?" I asked. Tends-four hors is not a lot
of time.

"I was thinking about tracking down Charlie Dayton and talking to him,"
Blake said.

"The mine chief executive officer?" I was surprised. "Do you think he
can help."

"I've been asking myself that question," Blake said. "Doesn't it seem
strange to you that he would have access to the house on Dollar Bay
Drive?"

"Not particularly," I said. "I assumed he and Mudd conferred often."

"Then Mudd would be at home and he could let him in," Blake said. "But
house access suggests he came when Mudd was not at home."

"He was having an affair with Kearsarge?" Josh suggested.

"That's a possibility," Blake said. "It suggests a motive for Mudd's
murder."

"Assassination," I corrected.

"Assassination then," Blake said. "He's dead either way."

"But assassination is public and legal," I said. "It's a technical
point, I agree, but Charlie Dayton would have known about the contract."

"Oh," Blake said. "I forget you all take such things in stride here."

I considered. Blake's reasoning made sense.

"Are there calls between Kearsarge and Charlie Dayton both before and
after Mudd's death?" I asked Josh. He was working on his in air screen.

"lots of them," he said. He spun the screen for Blake and me to see the
scrolling list.

"Emily Dickinson said Kearsarge was famous for her infidelity," I said.
"Can you summarize these messages?"

"Sure thing."

"Who is Emily Dickinson?" Blake asked.

"The assassin," I said. "He said he was pressured into doing it. He owed
someone big time."

"Emily Dickinson," Blake repeated. "You do have colorful names here on
Hypatia."

"Emily Dickinson is a colorful guy," I said. "He also does stand up
comic routines when he's sober enough. He's quite good."

I checked the time.

"It's too late to talk with him again." I yawned. "It's getting late for
me, too. I want to talk with The Czarina tomorrow to see if she has
heard anything."

"That will cost you," Josh said.

"I'm willing to pay," I said.

"I'm looking for a flight to Mark Antony," Blake said. "Charlie Dayton
is supposed to be at the mine. Do you want to come, Ronnie?"

The Czarina had breakfast around noon at Shepheard's Hotel. "I could go
after I speak with The Czarina," I said.

"That's good. We can't get a flight until afternoon. Will The Czarina
talk to me if I go with you?"

"Sure," I said. "She'll want to appear in one of your articles. She
loves notoriety."

"Then we have a plan." Blake said. \<

"When do we get back together?" Josh asked. "These routines will run all
night. I can check them in the morning."

"After we get back from Mark Antony," I said. "We can keep you in the
loop all day and you can message us with what you find out."

"I won't be coming back to Ptolemy City," Blake pointed out. I can book
my passage and just stay on the Alexandria Space Station."

"Let's meet there when you two get back," Josh said.

"We can talk remotely," I said. "What would be the reason for you to
shuttle up to the station?"

"Whoever is doing these messages can break any encoding I can manage at
the moment," Josh admitted. "Our conclusions would not be safe. A
face-to-face is our best bet to pool our information after you get
back."

"OK," I said. "When and where?"

We made our plans.

When I got up to leave, Josh got up to.

"I'm staying at your place tonight," Josh informed me.

"Really? I don't remember issuing an invitation."

"Call it protection," Josh said. "I don't want you to be alone except in
the shower. I can tell you what my scans have turned up in the morning
before you leave to talk to The Czarina."

I wanted to argue with him, to insist I was capable of taking care of
myself, but to tell the truth, his company would be comforting.

"OK," I said.

We arrived at my flat without incident. Josh made himself comfortable
and I got some much needed rest.

In the morning I found Josh sprawled out on my lounge chair enjoying the
view.

"You look comfortable," I observed.

"this is a much nicer view tan I have," Josh said. "How's the view on
Dollar Bay Drive?"

"Splendid from the roof garden," I said. "Learn anything?"

"I cracked the code for the Kearsarge Charlie Dayton affair," Josh said
without a trace of the work it must have taken to do that in his manner.
All in a day's work, I supposed.

"And," I said, acting as if such an accomplishment was a daily
achievement. Perhaps it was. I knew nothing about the hacking, I mean
security, business.

"They were definitely having an affair," Josh said.

"Was it going well?"

"Sort of," Josh said. "It was all hot and heavy in the beginning as you
would expect. Dayton was taken aback when Kearsarge told him about the
assassination contract. Mudd was a good mine manager and Dayton did not
want to lose him, but Kearsarge sweet-talked him. Things went a little
sour after the deed was done. Dayton wonders where he will find a new
manager. The mine employees, you can't really call them miners, thought
Dayton should have bought the contract from Kearsarge and nullified it."

"Could he have done that?" I asked.

"Of course. People buy their contracts every day. You know that."

"No, that's not what I'm asking," I said. "I'm wondering how much the
contract was for and could he have raised the money. Obviously, he had
no influence over Kearsarge to withdraw it and pay the penalties."

"It was a healthy contract," Josh said, looking the contract up.
"Kearsarge made the contract here in Ptolemy City, but she did not have
the power to cancel it. That's weird."

"Not if she was an agent for someone else," I suggested.

"Let's go with that," Josh speculated. "Someone off-world wants Samuel
Mudd dead. His wife is having an affair. It just happens to be Charlie
Dayton. This off-worlder gets Kearsarge to take out the contract and
Mudd gets blasted. It will look like a lover's quarrel."

"Then Kearsarge gets bumped off sans contract," I said.

"Could be the same off-worlder paying but not being particular about the
conventions here regarding contracts. Just hire some muscle."

"Perhaps Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan."

"Except no dagger was used. Posthumous Patty likes to cut. No, I don't
think they killed Kearsarge."

"Have you found out why those two had access to the house?"

"They worked for Mudd," Josh said. "His stuff is heavily encrypted. I'm
still working on that."

"Good work."

"Thanks."

So far. It looks like the affair between Kearsarge and Dayton was either
a cover for the assassination or a convenient cover story after the
fact.

"Can you send that information to Blake?"

"Sure. I can use a one-time address. Do you think he will cancel his
trip to the mine?"

Josh typed in the air as he spoke. I never developed the technique to
the extent he has.

"No," I said. "He is also looking for information on Mudd, for example,
why did he take this job? Why didn't he stay on Fair Haven? Is there a
connection between this mine and the smuggling operation he's
investigating."

"Oh, yeah, right," Josh said distractedly. "I forgot he has more to
learn than just who killed Kearsarge, why, and why are they after you
now."

I needed to remember Blake was after the bigger picture, the whole
sordid mess. I only needed to fulfill the directive Kearsarge gave me to
earn my fee. And, after all, earning my fee would allow me to afford the
house. I wondered if I would like living there. I would paint the
outside differently. Although breathtaking, I did not want to be
reminded of an alien landscape.

I left Josh on my balcony, assuring him I would be safe traveling to
Shepheard's Hotel under my own recognizance.

Shepheard's Hotel is, in many ways, at the core of the Tenderloin and
thus at the center of life in Ptolemy City.

"The hotel is not physically in the center of the dome. That would put
it in the Nile River and the center of Lake Memphis. Instead, it adjoins
the eastern wall so guests and visitors have an unobstructed view of the
Flaming Mountains, range of volcanoes which parallels the Nile and forms
the eastern boundary of the Nile Valley. On its western side, the hotel
has a view of Lake Memphis and the parkland which stretches from the
Ring Road to the lake shore.

Guests can easily get to the Valley of the Kings, the north-south
shopping street which is divided by Lake Memphis, by an open tram which
connects the hotel with the street on either side of the lake. The
conveyance is known locally as Tootles North and Tootles South. Anyone
can use it. You do not have to be registered at the hotel.

I used it to get from Valley of the Kings, a short caravan ride from my
flat to the grand entrance to the hotel.

People say that if you sit in the lobby of Shepheard's, eventually you
will see everybody in Ptolemy City pass by. I doubt this is literally
true, but it is true in the sense that lots of people cross its great
expanse and you never know who you might see.

I saw Captain Star Runner for the first time in this lobby. Star pranced
across its open floor space, a filmy scarf fluttering all around that
striking fur. I think I just stared that day. I had never seen a
Pantheran before. Most humans have never seen a Pantheran in the flesh.
They are called big cats because of their general resemblance to our
cats, but that description does not capture the self-assuredness with
which Star moves. Star was both predator and dancer that day, stirring a
longing and a passion in me no woman has ever succeeded to come anywhere
close to doing before or since.

Everybody watched Star, tail up, ears pointed forward, whiskers
immaculately groomed, nose quivering, each paw clicking as it touched
the marble floor. I watched breathlessly. Star is fuchsia-colored unlike
every other Pantheran any of us ever see on video. They are
pastel-colored, blue, pink, yellow, orange, even green. Star's coat is
rich and vibrant.

These thoughts crowded out any questions I might ask The Czarina. When I
reached the Terrace, I sternly told myself to put them away and
concentrate. I scanned the tables, looking. There she was and
thankfully, for my purpose, sitting alone.

I walked over.

"Hello, Czarina," I said.

Of course The Czarina is not a royal person. She is not even wealthy.
She pretends like many people in Ptolemy City. She wears a tiara on her
head and various pieces of costume jewelry. The bracelets clank when she
moves her arms which is frequent because she gestures when she speaks.
The Czarina is a service worker, writing a regular gossip column. She
would call it a news column but much of what she writes is invented.
People pay her not to be written about.

"Ronnie Camberwell," The Czarina exclaimed. "Do sit down. I've been
meaning to message you so we could get together and chat about
everything that happened to you while you were hay. I was so sorry to
hear about you and Captain Star Runner."

All of this was said in one breath.

"I've come today to talk to you about Kearsarge," I said, cutting off
her inquiry into my off-planet sojourn. The Czarina had been helpful to
Star in several of Star's adventures. I hope she would be helpful to me,
too.

"Terrible about her death," The Czarina said. It was a non-committal
response. What would it take to get her to talk to me? Perhaps I should
have said something about Star Runner.

"Yes," I said. "You know she asked me to investigate it posthumously.

"Really?" The Czarina said. "I had heard talk of that but you know, I
just thought it was talk."

"No," I said, "it's real enough."

The Czarina considered.

"I might be able to help you," she said, "but you know my services are
not free."

"Yes, I do," I said. "Thank you for being direct. It saves time."

"There is the little matter of my bill here," The Czarina said. "The
Terrace is a wonderful place to pick up news, but you cannot sit here
for free."

"I'll take care of it," I said, wondering how big a bill it was. I hoped
Kearsarge's financial institution would honor all my expenses. I would
have to settle Emily Dickinson's bar tab, too, if I wanted to talk to
him again. I wondered idly if Captain Kidd had a bar tab at the Treasure
Chest. Maybe he would have something else to say if I met him there.

"Sure thing," I said, reaching to activate the tab pad. I zeroed out her
account which was sizable. I added a little bit so I could order lunch.
My salad and tea arrived promptly. Despite the cost, it lack imagination
though all the ingredients were fresh.

"So what can you tell me?" I asked when I slipped the plates into the
recycler. Shepheard's did not employ waiters on the Terrace.

"She was a lady," The Czarina began, "I mean a real lady, married to a
lord. Did you know that?"

"Yes," I said, "I did. Do you know why they came here to the Pharaoh
Star System."

"The obvious reason was his position at the mine," The Czarina spoke
quietly, unlike her greeting and chatter beforehand. "I have gotten the
impression Samuel Mudd knew nothing about mining. He cleared up some
problem or other they were having there, but it had nothing to do with
the mining itself."

I waited.

"I don't know much about the mines. I know they are fairly automated.
What I do know is the Antonius they produce is very valuable. It's very
rare and it is needed for specialize equipment. I have heard, though I
cannot confirm this, that some of the ore has gone missing."

"It's been skimmed off the regular shipments?" I asked.

"No," The Czarina said. "I mean an entire ship's worth has just
disappeared."

"Taken out of the system without being tracked?"

"That is what I assume." The Czarina said.

"Is the League of Hypatian Pirates involved?" I asked.

"No, that's the sticking point. If Captain Star Runner were still in the
system, I would have picked him, or is it her, as the likely captain,
but the League is quite upset they weren't asked."

That might be what Captain Kidd knew -- that the League was not a
participant in the theft.

"Star would do the run," I agreed, "but Star's ride isn't big enough to
carry ore."

"It was processed. After it is processed, the pure antonium is in small
bars. Star's ship could have easily transported it."

"But not into the coalition," I objected.

"Of course not," The Czarina agreed. "If Samuel Mudd was involved, I
suspect it went to Fair Haven."

"Do you think Charlie Dayton knew about it?" I asked.

"Not until it was missing," The Czarina said.

"He was too busy with Kearsarge," I said.

"That's my guess," The Czarina said.

I changed tact.

"Know anything about Posthumous Patty or Dagger Dan?" I asked.

"Besides they are nasty characters?" The Czarina asked.

"Besides that."

"Kearsarge," and here The Czarina frowned, "Kearsarge liked things
rough."

"Sexually?" I asked.

"Yes, but that's not what I'm trying to say. I mean she liked living
rough."

"going to the River District, for example," I said.

"Exactly," The Czarina said. "Trying to fit in with the pirates."

"Did she?"

"Not really. They're smarter than that. They know a fraud when they see
one. But I think Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan were playing some sort
of a long con on her, but I can't tell you how it worked or if it
worked."

"And part of the con was acting as her buddies when she hung out with
the pirates," I said.

"Perhaps," The Czarina said. "I don't know she did that."

"I can probably check that out," I said.

I needed to ask The Czarina about the messages. Did I dare tell her
about the one I received?

I tried to remember what Star told me. Then I remembered how The Czarina
helped during one very difficult incident. It unmasked her somehow, but
Star held it close.

I leaned over the table and spoke very softly. "Kearsarge received death
threats. I don't know from whom. I'm trying to find out. Now I have
received a threat. Whoever is sending them wants me to quit
investigating. Have you heard anything about messages from outside the
Pharaoh Star System?"

The Czarina was surprised and dismayed.

"Oh dear, Ronnie, this sounds so serious."

"It is serious," I said.

"I don't like handling this sort of information," The Czarina said.

"I'm sorry," I said, "but I have to know. I need to stop this."

"Of course you do," The Czarina said. "I am for women taking care of
themselves. I always had to take care of myself. Now let me think."

I let her think, swallowing the last of my now cold tea.

"I heard Kearsarge mention it once," she said. "She accused her husband
right here on the Terrace. He denied it, of course. I can't say anything
more."

"That's helpful," I said, though at the moment I wasn't sure how.

"By the way, do you know what pressure was put on Emily Dickinson to
come back here to assassinate Samuel Mudd?"

"is that why he came back?" The Czarina asked. "You are full of juicy
tidbits today, Ronnie. I knew I should talk to you."

"That is what he said," I said. "I have to talk to him again. I think
it's all related somehow."

"Well," The Czarina said, "the way he is drinking, do it soon. I can't
imagine he'll last much longer at this rate."

"That bad?" I asked.

"That bad," The Czarina confirmed. "It's really a shame."

"It is," I said.

As I got up to leave The Czarina asked, "Is Captain Star Runner coming
back to Hypatia?"

"Not as far as I know," I said. "Star's working on a big project a long
ways from here."

"Can you tell me about it?" The Czarina asked.

"Afraid not," I said, "it's confidential."

It was a long complicated story and I did not want to discuss it with
anyone. I'll let Star tell it if Star wants to tell it. (It is a yet
unpublished tale.)

I had just enough time to make it to the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport for
my shuttle ride to the Alexandria Space Station.

12.   The spaceport is located outside the Ptolemy City dome proper in
an area called the Levant. Sometimes it is referred to as the Tripoli
Spaceport by old time pirates who know the history of the League.
Captain Star Runner mentioned it once, but then Star has access to
databases replete which such information. Right now, I just wanted not
to miss my shuttle.

13.   ## Chapter 19

14.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Notes for ## Chapter 18

Kearsarge liked living "rough" according to The Czarina. Speculation:
Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan were her "Best Friends" in this
affectation.

Josh learned the house AI Arthur has some sophisticated subroutines.
Josh cannot identify them so he has walled them off.

The Czarina and Josh confirmed an affair between Kearsarge and Charlie
Dayton. It is unclear what Kearsarge's motivation was: lust or a cover
for the assassination contract.

Josh has sent the encrypted files to the Fungusians to learn how to
crack it.

The Czarina told me about the theft of antonium from the mines. The
League of Hypatian Pirates is upset they were not asked to transport it
out of the system.

Question: Why did Charlie Dayton not purchase the contract on Sam Mudd
and save his life? He was upset at his death.

Note to self: Ronnie says she will take Blake Redman to the interview
with The Czarina but does not. The interview makes sense with Ronnie
alone though The Czarina and Blake would have wanted to talk to each
other. The Czarina is quite open with Ronnie which would not have been
the case if Blake was present. Captain Star Runner is a common element
between the two women.

 

I just made the shuttle, sliding into the seat next to Blake. We could
not talk freely so we said nothing.

The shuttle has few amenities. It is just a caravan ride up to the space
station. We strapped in, lifted and made our way through the atmosphere
on a pronounced angle. The Alexandria Space Station is in a synchronous
orbit above Hypatia, but not in view of Ptolemy City so it does not
block the spectacular views of the night sky or the daytime views of
erupting volcanoes and swirling colored winds and snow.

We exited the shuttle and Blake consulted a screen. He frowned. \<

"No mention of our shuttle to Mark Antony," he said.

"It wouldn't be on that screen," I said. "That is for passengers going
out of the system. We go this way to the inter-lunar flights."

"Inter-lunar?" Blake asked.

"Sure," I said. The medical facility is on Cleopatra."

I did not mention the League's dilapidated station at Over the Moon. If
we could avoid that place the better off we would be. I knew Captain
Star Runner preferred it. There was less scrutiny there. Star made a
point that I was dropped off here at the Alexandria Space Station. The
docking fees were much higher.

"Oh well," I thought. "Tact was never one of Star's gifts." It both
endeared Star to me and irritated me. I guess it did not matter anymore.

We found our flight. Gone were the upholstered chairs and cheery colors.
Everything about the departure area was utilitarian. You could hardly
call it a lounge at all.

We were the only ones on the flight. I knew it had to travel to Mark
Antony even if it was empty. The evening flight back would most likely
be full.

"Ever been to the mine?" Blake asked me.

"Never," I said. "I have never had a reason to go. Properly speaking,
the police have no jurisdiction there."

"I can't find out who owns the mine," Blake said. "No one seems to
know."

"I suspect a lot of people do know," I said, "they just haven't made the
information public. I've heard it's a consortium back in the Solar
League. They insist it is a holding outside the Coalition so they don't
have to register it."

"And in the Pharaoh Star System, anything goes," Blake said.

"Basically," I said.

"What about the miners?"

"There aren't any," I said. "It's automated. The employees maintain the
equipment and oversee the processing. Ships are loaded and the ore goes
out of the system. That's it."

"Are those people considered service workers?" Blake asked.

"I don't know for sure," I said. "They may have shares in the mine."

Blake shook his head.

"It's a strange business here," he said.

"But it works for us, most of the time," I said.

"I suppose," Blake said.

The shuttle deposited us at a dock where the ore ships were loaded. We
were in a sealed corridor. Beyond the walls we could here the machinery
running and the sound of ore being shifted. I realized there was vacuum
beyond the thin wall of the walkway and I shuddered. This was the part
of space which terrified me. I could pretend I was safe aboard the
shuttles, but not here. I walked quickly away.

As a schoolgirl I had seen a video about the mine. They put the ore into
big containers and loaded them onto freighters with cavernous interiors.
The antonium and other precious metals were refined and packed carefully
into briefcase-sized boxes. The freighters were all automatic. They
could take years to reach their destinations. The precious bars were
taken aboard couriers who piloted them through hyperspace quickly to
reach their destinations. I wondered how that was done with the
interdiction. Maybe the Coalition allowed some items through. Maybe it
was not a proper interdiction anymore. I had no way of knowing and for
the most part, it made little difference to me. There certainly was not
a slowing of the Rich and Famous coming to The Pharaoh Star System.

Charlie Dayton greeted us when we finally found his office. Apparently
he was expecting us. The office itself was surprisingly comfortable. It
possessed those holograms of windows with pleasant scenes depicted to
give the illusion that we were not deep inside the lunar crust. Dayton
chose pictures of a blue ocean with waves coming up onto a white sandy
beach. A sailboat was passing by. I wondered if these tides came in and
if the boat passed in and out of the frame over time. Star did not have
such pictures on the walls of the spaceship we traveled in. There had
been no art at all. Star had no need of it. Anything Star wanted to see
could be recreated in Star's brain by the AI Christabel. How strange
that anything relating to space always caused me to reference it by
thinking of Star.

"Thank you for seeing us," Blake was telling Charlie Dayton. "We have
some questions about Samuel Mudd and his wife Kearsarge."

Charlie Dayton looked uncomfortable.

"We know about your relationship with Kearsarge," I said.

Charlie Dayton looked embarrassed. "It was a stupid thing to have done,"
He admitted. "She was flashy, different. I found myself in the affair
long before I had even decided to do it."

"She manipulated you then?" Blake said more than asked.

"More like threw herself at me," Dayton said. "She was a wild thing."

"Rough," I said.

"That would be a good word for it," Dayton agreed.

"What about the assassination contract," I said. "Did you try to have it
canceled?"

"I did," Dayton said, appearing relieved to talk about it. "When I heard
about it, I went to her immediately. you have to stop this, I told her.
I can't lose Sam. But she laughed and said it would be all right. We
could be together and the mine would go on just as it had without him. I
didn't know what to do."

"You didn't try to buy the contract and cancel it yourself?" I asked.

"I only found out afterward that you could do that," Dayton said.

"How long have you lived here?" I asked.

"Ten years."

"And you didn't know you could buy an assassination contract?" I asked.
I was very skeptical.

"You don't understand, Investigator Camberwell," Dayton said, "I don't
get to Ptolemy City often--at least I didn't until I became involved
with Kearsarge and Sam Mudd. I came to Mark Antony to make money and to
save it. The pay is good. The opportunity to spend it here is almost
nil. I figured I could go back to the Solar League and have a decent
living on a backwater planet. It seems a very good deal. I don't even
have to know much about mining. I just have to make good deals on
selling the ore. I was doing OK with that."

"Until," Blake prompted.

"Until the antonium went missing," Dayton said. He sounded quite
miserable.

"Did it happen just once," I asked.

"Yes, but we had a large stockpile. The price of antonium had dipped. We
were waiting for a more auspicious time to sell."

"And now the price has gone sky high," Blake suggested.

"Scarcity will do that," Dayton confirmed.

"So what exactly did Sam Mudd do here?" I asked.

Dayton did not answer. We waited. He fidgeted with some objects on his
desk.

"Do you know why he was here?" Blake asked very quietly. "We heard he
was straightening out a problem and that he was very popular with the
other mine employees."

"There was a problem," Dayton said, "about salaries. I reported this to
the Board and they brought in Sam. He said the problem was resolved. I
expected him to leave then, but the Board said he should stay in case
there was another problem."

"And then the antonium went missing," Blake said.

"That's right," Dayton said.

"And then you had another problem for Sam Mudd to solve," I said.

"Right again."

"But he didn't solve it, did he?" I said. "He was killed."

"Yes."

Blake said, "Who is on the Board?"

"I don't know," Charlie said. "I don't know names. I've never seen them.
I send reports over the link and I get responses or directives."

"Can you tell me anything else?" Blake asked.

"Not really. I'm processing ore, extracting antonium and shipping out
the other metals. That's what I do here. I'm good at it. I've sworn off
going anywhere near Ptolemy City."

"Thank you for your time," I said, checking the time. We could make the
next shuttle off. We had a reservation.

We all shook hands and Blake and I walked back through myriad
passageways back to the shuttle. We said noting to each other about our
interview. We did not know who was listening. In fact, we had no idea if
Charlie Dayton's office was bugged. If he wasn't checking for bugs, it
would have seemed strange for us to go over the room. And there were
lots of places they could have been hidden there. The windows alone
would have made a perfect hiding place.

I settled into my very uncomfortable seat. Josh would be waiting for us
at the First Cataract Lounge. Not only was it the first bar disembarking
passengers passed on their way to the shuttle departure area, it had a
fountain which looked like a waterfall. The First cataract Lounge was
very noisy and we thought it would be a good place to share our findings
before Blake boarded his starship back to the Solar League.

We found Josh, a drink at his elbow, playing a fast and complicated
video game. Blake and I sat down, ordered our own drinks and waited.
Finally Josh swiped his screen clean.

"I've gotten to level eighty-nine," he announced triumphantly.
"Congratulate me."

Same old Josh.

"A gamer till the end," I said. "Find out anything new on our case?"

Josh shook his head. "I've been running everything I can think of," he
said, "but I can't crack anything."

"What about Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan?" I asked. "Can you get into
their conversations?"

"There isn't much there," Josh said. "Things like, meet you there, and
same time same place. I don't have a reference so I can't give you
anything."

"How often did Kearsarge contact Fair Haven?" I asked.

"Can't say." Josh was quite miserable. "I thought I had lots of data to
crunch, but it's all locked down."

"Has anything been deleted?" Blake asked.

"Can't tell," Josh said.

"I mean since you started interrogating the system. Is it just waiting
for you to decrypt it?"

"Apparently. The person who set it up is quite confident I can't break
into it. It really irks me. I'm a good hacker."

"And we haven't heard from the Fungusians?" I said.

"I got a return receipt that the data arrived," Josh said, "but that's
it."

"That's something," I said. "The network continues to be upgraded. The
turn around time is lessening."

"You're right," Josh said. He sounded excited. "They must want to talk
with me."

"The Fungusians love to crack code," I said. "The ability to decrypt
that system will be an upgrade offered over their network." I caught
myself before I said, "It will be in Star's next database refresh." It
would be, but no one hear need knew that. What did anyone care, what did
I care, that Captain Star Runner could decrypt Arthur's database.

We shared our findings with Josh.

"The key thing you found out," Josh said, "is that Charlie Dayton
doesn't know who he is working for. None of us knows who owns the mines
on Mark Antony."

"And Sam Mudd may be linked to the disappearance of the antonium," Blake
added. "I think that's where I need to dig next. When I find out, and I
will find out, I'll let you know."

He stood then. We heard the boarding call for his starship.

We said our good-byes: Nice to meet you. Stay in touch. I'll let you
know what I find out. It was all the things you'd expect. A pleasure to
work with you. Look me up if you ever get to ----.

15.   Then Blake walked out of the First Cataract Lounge. I did not
expect to ever see him again.

16.   ## Chapter 20

17.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 19

Josh has not heard anything from the Fungusians yet though he did
receive a confirmation they received his data on the encryption routines
in the house AI Arthur.

Blake and I interviewed Charlie Dayton.

Strangely, Charlie Dayton was unaware a assassination contract could be
purchased.

Dayton's responsibility is chiefly to get the ore sold.

He said Mudd was hired to resolve salary issues with mine employees.

Charlie Dayton does not who his Board is.

Although I have a better picture of Charlie Dayton's role, I now have
more questions than I have answers.

Blake is going back to the Solar League to trace the missing antonium.

 

"I got the feeling," I told Josh, Charlie Dayton didn't want to know
anything. He just wanted to do his job and get paid. I think our
questions made him very uncomfortable."

"A theft, an assassination and a mysterious board of directors is a lot
to answer for in one afternoon," Josh said. "I'd certainly be nervous if
someone came around asking me about all that."

"And an affair with a woman who ended up dead," I added. "I get your
point."

"Are you Investigator Ronnie Camberwell?" someone asked me from behind.

I turned around. A station security officer stood behind me.

"Yes," I said, "what is this about?"

"If you will come with me," the officer said.

"Why?" I asked.

"Please come quietly," the officer said. "It is best if we don't make a
scene."

I got up. Josh got up, too.

"I'm coming with you," he said.

"That's fine," the security officer said. "Just come quickly and
quietly."

We exited the lounge.

"Security Chief Harris has some questions for you," the officer said.

"I knew Tara Lee Harris slightly. Had we met once? The police force in
Ptolemy City and the Security Office on the Alexandria Space Station
often traded information on the movement of persons of interest. We
often picked up someone the other office needed to interrogate.

"I'm not on the police force anymore," I told the security officer.

"We know," the security officer said. "Please, I can't answer any of
your questions. Chief Harris will explain."

That was fair. We were on one of the many busy concourses. A discussion
of security here would alarm already anxious passengers.

We were shown into Tara Lee's cramped office. Almost every working space
aboard a space station is cramped -- more cramped than a domed city.

"Thank you for coming, Ronnie," Tara Lee said, stretching out her hand.
"And who is this?"

"My associate, Josh Hardy," I said.

"Of Hardy Security Systems?" Tara Lee asked.

"The same," Josh said.

They shook hands.

"I have bad news for you," Tara Lee said, getting immediately to the
point. "Blake Redman is dead."

"Dead?" I said. "I just saw him--"

"Yes, I know." Tara Lee cut across my ridiculous statement. "Someone saw
him leave the First Cataract Lounge and head for the lockers. Another
passenger reported he opened it and slumped forward. They called First
Aid but he was pronounced dead at the scene. There was nothing anyone
could do."

"Do you know what killed him?" I asked.

"No," Tara Lee said. "We assumed it was something medical until we found
this."

She handed me a sealed clear bag. Inside the bag was a written note."

"Tell Ronnie Camberwell she's next."

I showed the note to Josh wordlessly.

"I think you better sit down," Tara Lee said.

"I think you're right," I said.

This made her small office even more cramped.

"Talk tome, investigator," Tara Lee said. Her tone was crisp. "What do
you know about this? You and your companion didn't seem overly
surprised.

"This is the second threat I've received," I said. "The first was a
message to my link. I believe both threats are connected to a case I'm
investigating. Blake Redman and I were cooperating. Our interest are
different, but there is enough similarity in our investigations that we
thought we could be helpful to each other."

"And who would want him dead?" Tara Lee asked.

"Many people," I said. "The list of suspects is quite lengthy."

"And this involves a security matter?" Tara Lee guessed.

"No, not directly," I said. "I'm investigating a death. Redman is, was,
investigating a smuggling operation based on the Southern Frontier."
"And he was in the Pharaoh Star System because --"

"Because he was covering the Olympics," I said, having a Sudden burst of
inspiration.

"And you expect me to believe that?" Tara Lee scoffed. "Surely you have
a higher opinion of me than that?"

"I don't know what I'm dealing with here," I said, snapping back at her
tone. "I don't know if telling you more will put you at risk."

"I appreciate that," Tara Lee said. "Why don't you say a little more.
You haven't explained why you need a security expert."

I sighed. "OK," I said, Marshalling my thoughts. Not knowing what I
needed to know to put all the pieces of this puzzling case made
summarizing it extremely difficult. "I was hired to find out where some
death threats were coming from. The person ended up dead. Blake Redman
and I thought the person's death might be related to some of his
investigations back on the Southern Frontier and inside the Coalition.
Because of the messages, I hired Josh." \<

"So you think the smugglers got to him," Tara Lee said.

"Perhaps," I said.

"If this is League business," Tara Lee began to say--

"The League says it is not involved," I said.

Tara Lee's position aboard the space station made it necessary for her
to walk a fine line between enforcing what law there is in the Pharaoh
Star System, catering to the Rich and Famous who frequent it and
allowing the League of Hypatian Pirates to operate without injuring
service workers, and paying passengers. Sometimes one could not happen
without the other.

"And this person would be connected with the Solar League Olympics,"
Tara Lee said.

"That's right," I said.

"And there was an assassination contract, too."

"There was."

"And you and Blake Redman have just returned from Mark Antony where
there has been a sizable theft."

"Yes indeed."

"I'm getting a sense of the scope of your investigation." Tara Lee said
thoughtfully.

"And you don't know the half of it," Josh said, having been quiet far
longer than usual.

"OK." Tara Lee sighed. "I have to make a report to the station manager.
"Properly speaking, we're dealing with the death of a service worker
from the Solar League. That's pretty high profile around here. Unless we
can say it was from natural causes, we have a murder on our hands.
That's not good for business."

"Never mind not being good for Redman," I said.

"No argument there," Tara Lee said.

"Our shuttle leaves in fifteen minutes," Josh said. "If we hurry, we can
make it."

"I'm afraid you'll have to miss it," Tara Lee said. "I need to talk with
you both more if my boss agrees this is murder."

"Reschedule the flight," I told Josh, "we'll get the last one out
tonight."

As it turned out, we canceled that flight, too. Tara Lee found us births
where we could sleep that night. There was more to discuss than we
initially thought.\
\

The station manager decided Tara Lee should investigate the death of
Blake Redman. As a investigative journalist for the leading Solar League
news conglomerate, his death would be a leading story. The powers that
be on Hypatia and who controlled the Alexandria Space Station were
concerned about adverse publicity. If the Security Office could clear
the matter up quickly and show that his death was related to his work
rather than dangerous conditions in the Pharaoh Star System, the
negative publicity might be neutralized. Security Chief Tara Lee found
herself the lead on a very high profile case. She thought Josh and I
might have the information she needed to wrap the case up in short
order. I doubted this would be true.

Neither Josh nor I were compelled to give Tara Lee much information. We
could easily claim it was business-related and therefore beyond her
ability to coerce. However, we made an agreement. We would pool our
resources. She would get credit for solving Blake's murder. I would
finish investigation and earn my fee. Josh would be paid for his
security skills -- at least from Tara Lee. I was certainly going to
bargain with Josh. My contacts in the Fungusian Network counted for
something.

"You're clear you are putting yourself at risk heading up this
investigation," I said to Tara Lee as we sat over dinner in the
employees canteen.

"Aren't we used to that?" Tara Lee asked, cutting into her soy steak.

"Blake Redman is dead," I said. "Kearsarge is dead. You saw the threat
made against me."

"To be very direct, Ronnie," Tara Lee said, "if someone comes after me,
it's like coming after the station itself. The powers that be won't
tolerate that."

"That won't help you if you're dead," Josh said.

"I'm expecting that to keep me from being dead," Tara Lee responded.

"How soon will we get the autopsy results?" I asked.

"Ronnie, I'm eating," Josh objected. "Remember, I'm not a hardened cop."

"I'm hoping the answer to Blake's death will tell us something useful,"
I said. "So far, we don't know what we're up against."

"We should have the results by midnight," Tara Lee said.

"I'm not staying up for that," Josh yawned. "I was up most of last
night."

"I told you I would be all right," I said.

"I was working on the house AI most of the time," Josh said.

I picked at my vegetables. The hydroponic and solar gardens on the space
station were quite good. The restaurants needed a reliable source of
fresh items. I decided it was not the quality of the ingredients but the
uninspired way they were combined in an indifferent sauce. On the other
hand, it might just be my mood.

I was started to deal with Blake's death. I had liked him, liked his
confident manner, his knowledge and his go-in-there-and-get-the-job done
attitude. Now I wondered who would ever trace the antonium. I doubted
the Solar League Examiner would assign somebody else. Besides, the new
reporter would not have the contacts, have the sense of the way all the
pieces fit together.

Tara Lee received a message.

"Josh," she said, "you're a decrypter, aren't you?"

"The best in the Pharaoh Star System," Josh said without any trace of
arrogance. I guessed he probably was.

"Forensics have just released Blake's link. Do you think you could take
a look and see what information you can access?"

"Sure thing," Josh said, slurping up another spoonful of the soup of the
day.

"That's great," Tara Lee said.

Later Josh found Tara Lee and me in her little office.

"I've opened up Blake's link," Josh said. "He had it well-encrypted but
he used off-the-shelf components. I know my way around these pretty
well.

"He didn't salt things very well?" Tara Lee asked.

"He did," Josh said, "but I have the neural routines to figure them out
and the network speed to make it practical."

"I see," Tara Lee said, but of course neither of us had any idea what
Josh really meant. I remembered Captain Star Runner commenting that the
better the artificial intelligence, the more leaps of logic they could
employ to figure out what to do. I suspected that was what Josh was
talking about. Star's AI learned from Star's way of thinking. In turn,
the Fungusian Network learned from the synergy between them.

"What do you have?" Tara Lee asked.

"I'm still compiling all the data," Josh said. "I need to recreate his
databases and understand how he linked them. The problem is that his
picture is incomplete. What I can tell you is more about the York family
and their smuggling empire. That is what Blake called it: an empire."

"The York family?" Tara Lee asked.

"Kearsarge's family name," I said.

"I'm not sure the particulars are helpful to us," Josh said. "I'm
looking for any connections to the Pharaoh Star System in any way. So
far, all I've come up with is that they did handle antonium from time to
time."

"That's a start," I said. "Go with that. Can I help?"

"You know how to run database queries?" Josh said, "lots of fuzzy logic
and parameter combinations?"

"I think so," I said. I could here Star Runner's breathy voice, talking
to Christabel, trying to ask questions to get at information she had but
did not put together in the way Star wanted it to be organized to give a
useful answer.

"I think I can do it," I said. "Let me try."

Josh's system was nowhere near as sophisticated as talking to the
Pantheran AI, but I managed to learn, and fairly quickly I am proud to
say, how to talk with Josh's system. We had only a tiny bit of delay,
sending the queries back to Ptolemy City.

18.   Names. Dates Locations. A family tree. And then I saw it: the
name. The location. The position. Another piece of the puzzle clicked
into place.

19.   ## Chapter 21

20.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 20

Josh has hacked Blake's link and made the data available along with his
sophisticated database query tools.

I have found a name and location which I think will be helpful for our
investigation going forward.

We are still waiting for the Fungusian Network to contact us and for the
results of the autopsy.

Working with Tara Lee has been a profitable collaboration thus far.

 

I stared at my case notes. A profitable collaboration? That would be
something Captain Star Runner would say. Star always thought in terms of
profit. Had our relationship failed because I was no longer profitable?

"You're tired," I told myself. "You've had quite a shock today. Blake
Redman was murdered minutes after he left you and Josh at the First
Cataract Lounge. How can you possibly think that of Star?"

Star is many things, not all of them good or helpful, but Star values
friendship. It is one of the human characteristics Star most wants to
emulate. Star was very insistent that we were still friends, that I
mattered. If I stopped to think about it objectively, Star's friends
were all close friends. Star had no gradation. There were friends,
enemies and acquaintances. Lots of people knew Star simply because Star
was a Pantheran, and a distinctive Pantheran at that. Star never forgot
a name thanks to Christabel the AI. That did not mean that Star counted
many people as friends though. There was me, Colonel Gyllian Romeres
Lujo, Tamara, Emily Dickinson and perhaps The Czarina. That was it.

This line of thinking did nothing at all to consider the name and
location I found in Blake's data.

Jean Jacques Roseau. That had to be a moniker. No one would have that
name. I was sure about that. In any event, Roseau worked at the
Aesculapius Medical Center on Cleopatra.

Blake had never mentioned Roseau to me. Why not? Was I jumping to
conclusions? Or did I see a connection because I knew the Pharaoh Star
System and Blake did not.

Jean Jacques Roseau.

Age thirty-seven.

Born on Fair Haven.

Third son of Lord Marcus Garvey of Green Lake, Mountain District.

Occupation: medical technician.

Unmarried.

In the notes field Blake had written: unrelated to investigation.

Why? I wondered. Why was Jean Jacques Roseau unrelated to Blake's
investigation. He was a Fair Haven emigrate living in the Pharaoh Star
System where both Kearsarge and Samuel Mudd emigrated.

I searched Blake's entire database for any hint he knew about the
Aesculapius Medical Center or where it was located.

Nothing. Nothing at all.

"I need a reality check," I told Tara Lee who was sitting at the same
table I was in the canteen. She also looked very tired, but she was
waiting for the autopsy results. Several of her security officers were
questioning people who might have seen something when Blake was
murdered, but most of the witnesses had already embarked on their star
liners and were long gone building speed on their way to the Pharaoh
Star System's jump gate into hyperspace.

"What have you found?" Tara Lee asked. "You look very puzzled.

"I've outlined Blake's investigation to you," I began.

"Smuggling from Fair Haven into the Coalition," Tara Lee said. "What of
it?"

"Well, more to my dilemma: Fair Haven is structured around fiefdoms.
There are royal families with alliances based on marriage and blood
ties."

"OK," Tara Lee said. "So what?"

"Kearsarge was part of the York family who made an important alliance
with the Bender family," I said. "The Yorks are smugglers, at lea
according to Blake. Kearsarge's marriage to a Bender was a big deal as
that is the controlling family in her region."

"OK. What does that have to do with Redman's death?"

"This," I said, "a minor relative of the Benders works at the
Aesculapius Medical Center as a medical technician."

"I don't see how that matters," Tara Lee said.

"For one thing," I said, "we're a good ways from Fair Haven. Granted
both Fair Haven and the Pharaoh Star System are outside the Coalition,
but we're not close star-graphically."

"A coincidence then," Tara Lee suggested. "You're grasping at straws.
You said this person is a medical technician. What of it?"

"A large shipment of antonium went missing recently from the mines on
Mark Antony. No one knows who got it out of the mines and where they
took it. The League of Hypatian Pirates say they're not involved. But
the Aesculapius Medical Center is right next door to Over the Moon. A
shuttle could easily go from Mark Antony to /Cleopatra. They're only
three hours apart by shuttle."

"I see what you mean," Tara Lee said. "You have a family member, albeit
a distant family member, right next to a spaceport where the shuttle
could have been unloaded and the antonium transferred to any ship at
Over the Moon. That ship could be well away from here and with no one
the wiser. There are no customs inspections, no filing of flight plans,
no log that you were ever there."

"Bingo," I said. "Essentially, the antonium could disappear into thin
air and only reappear, in very small amounts, through the Fair Haven
smuggling channels into the Coalition, keeping the price high and the
availability low."

"And add to that," Tara Lee said, "the Aesculapius Medical Center could
have its own supply of antonium for its procedures."

"I never thought of that," I said.

"I'm willing to bet on that," Tara Lee said. "This medical technician,
whoever it is, did not act alone. A deal was struck. This is, after all,
the Pharaoh Star System."

"Aesculapius has a whole fleet of medical shuttles," I said. "Bring one
into Mark Antony and when you leave, take the antonium with you."

"That's reasonable," Tara Lee said. "I bet if you check with Charlie
Dayton, you'll find he has the medical shuttles there pretty regularly."

"I'll check that out," I said, sending a message.

"I'd also see what you can find out about the medical technician through
Aesculapius."

"Good idea."

I went to Josh's search tools. They had to hack the Aesculapius
personnel files.

"Jean Jacques Roseau," I read aloud. "Assistant to the Director of
Medical Technology and Supplies."

"Doing a good turn for the director I should think," Tara Lee said. "Who
is the director?"

"Amy Bridgman," I said.

"And does Roseau have a relationship with Bridgman?"

"They have the same address in the housing directory," I said.

"Check and check." Tara Lee said.

"All of this is speculation on our parts," I cautioned.

"True, but in the Pharaoh Star System, that is often all we have to
solve a case," Tara Lee said. "We can't arrest anybody. We can't
prosecute anybody. We can only make our suspicions known and let things
happen."

I thought about this. What were the implications of what I thought I had
just figured out. Consequences matter a great deal in our part of the
western galactic arm. People were assassinated for less.

"We don't know who contacted whom," I said slowly. "If Mudd was the
perpetrator, he could have pressured Roseau. If I understand Blake's
chart of the royal family and all of its relatives, Mudd had a closer
relationship to the Crowned Prince than Roseau. Roseau is so far down
the royal line as to not mater at all."

"So Mudd used that leverage to get Roseau to receive the stolen goods,.
Is that what you are saying?" Tara Lee asked.

"I think it is more likely than the other way around," I said.
"Rousseau's counter, and I have no evidence for this at all, is to say
Aesculapius gets a cut for using its shuttle. Roseau would not have
direct access to a shuttle. He probably had to pay some folks off and
get the antonium off the shuttle and onto the courier."

"Mm," Tara Lee muttered. "I see where you are going with this."

"I'm not saying Rousseau's clean here. Bridgman may not be clean either.
I'm just saying that it may not have been their idea."

"And if I'm understanding you correctly, Mudd was doing this because
Kearsarge pressured him to do so."

"I think that's why they came to the Pharaoh Star System anther first
place. I think they were sent here to get the antonium for the York
family business."

"And how long were they here?" Tara Lee asked.

"Four years," I said.

"That's a very long con," Tara Lee said. She sounded doubtful.

"It takes a long time to mine the antonium," I said.

"I suppose. But how does that help me find out who killed Blake Redman?
Are you suggesting it was Roseau?"

I thought about that.

"No," I said. "Blake had not connected these dots at all. He was going
back to the Solar League. His big question was: Who was on the board of
directors for the mines."

"Who knows? Who cares?" Tara Lee shrugged.

"Blake hinted he thought the Board might have something to do with the
smuggling," I said. "We don't care about the smuggling from a law
enforcement point of view. But Blake did."

"Solar League thinking," Tara Lee said.

"Precisely," I said.

"But I still think--" I trailed off. Still think? Had I been thinking
this or had it just suggested itself to me.

"I still think," I repeated, "that Kearsarge herself might be involved.
If she was pressuring Mudd and he wanted out, that would be a good
reason to assassinate him. Perhaps he was going to tell someone. Then
Blake comes along and he ants to tell the whole Coalition what is going
on here and on Fair Haven. So he has to be eliminated, too."

"So from your perspective, you still have to figure out who offed
Kearsarge and why," Tara Lee said.

"And if I find the answer to that mystery, I'll know who killed Blake,"
I said.

"And the opposite is true also," Tara Lee said. "If I find out who
murdered Redman, you'll know who killed Kearsarge."

"Definitely," I said.

"My head is spinning," Tara Lee said.

"Mine, too." I said.

"Sleep might be helpful," Tara Lee said.

"I'm with you there." I said.

Tara Lee laughed. \<p\>"An interesting suggestion," she said. "But I
think I'll pass tonight."

I smiled, too.

"I quite agree," I said.

It was that easy. A suggestive phrase and Tara Lee and I were laughing
about sharing a bed. The suggestion had its appeal though I doubted the
subject would come up again.

We were closing down our links and wiping away our screens when Josh
came into the canteen.

He was bleary-eyed and his hair stood out all over his head. Clearly he
had just gotten up and probably out of a sound sleep.

"The Fungusians cracked the encryption," he announced. "I thought you'd
like to know.

Josh collapsed more than sat down at our table.

"They said it was interesting. Apparently they are quite pleased with
the information I'm sending them. We got an answer so fast because more
network resources were devoted to working on it. This is very good for
my business."

"Theirs, too," I said.

"True. True," Josh said. "I've applied the code they sent me. We should
have the files wide open by morning."

"Then you go back to sleep," I said. "If your systems can do all this
unattended, you need some sleep."

"You're not looking so wide awake either," Josh said.

"I'm not," I said. "I'm turning in, too. We'll compare notes at
breakfast."

"Sounds good," Tara Lee said. "Eight o'clock work for you, two?"

"Yes," I said.

21.   We all left the canteen for some well-deserved rest. Maybe in the
morning we would finally have some answers.

22.   ## Chapter 22

23.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 22

In going through Blake Redman's link, I discovered what I think to be
the key to explaining how the antonium was stolen from the Mark Antony
Mines.

In my humble opinion, Kearsarge pressured Sam Mudd to arrange for the
antonium to be purloined. He enlisted the aid of one of his relatives
who worked in the procurement office for the Aesculapius Medical Center.
A shuttle from the medical center was used to transfer the antonium from
Mark Antony to Cleopatra where it was loaded onto a courier at the Over
the Moon Spaceport.

These conclusions are not provable and not prosecutable as far as Tara
Lee and I can determine.

Questions still remain, however, and these may lead us to Blake Redman's
killer which I believe is the same person who killed Kearsarge.

Blake's murder makes some sense: the killer or the killer's employer was
afraid Blake was getting close to discovering him, her, them.
Kearsarge's murder is less intelligible. If she was the one responsible
for the heist, why was she killed?

Josh has received information from the Fungusian Network which will
allow him to get full access to the house AIs files. We are meeting to
discuss his findings and to start probing the information at breakfast.

 

I had just taken my first sip of tea when my link signaled. The
vibration pattern on my arm was urgent. It was also a video call from
Ptolemy City which surprised me. Who was calling me? The name on the
call was unfamiliar. I accepted the call anyway. It could be a tip and
stars above I sure needed one about now.

The Czarina's face appeared, old and worried. Without her makeup and
tiara, she looked quite haggard.

"Ronnie, I didn't know who else to call," she said, anxiety permeating
her voice. "Emily Dickinson has been rushed to Aesculapius. He said to
get in touch you regardless of the cost. He said it was urgent that you
knew. He wants to talk with you, to tell you something. He looked
terrible. He said he was poisoned. He said he knew he was poisoned
because he was poisoned once before. I know that to be true. Captain
Star Runner got him to the medical center in time. It patched up their
relationship. They had broken up--"

"He's being shuttled there right now?" I interrupted what might be a
long story. I did not think a former poisoning and the relationship
between Emily Dickinson and Star Runner was important just now.

"Yes. Can you get to the spaceport right away? You can catch the early
shuttle if you hurry," The Czarina said.

"I'm on the Alexandria Space Station," I said. "I'll get to Aesculapius
as soon as I can. Thank you for calling me."

I cut the call before The Czarina could say more. Damn! I should have
thanked her and told her I would cover her cost. Well, time enough for
that later.

"When is the next shuttle to Aesculapius?" I asked Tara Lee who was
putting some luscious-looking jam on her multi grain toast.

"Run," Tara Lee said. "You can catch it. I'll tell them you're coming
and to wait--security business."

"Thanks, Tara Lee," I said, pushing back from the table. "I'll be back
as soon as I can."

"I'm coming, too," Josh said, grabbing his breakfast sandwich off the
plate. "You can fill me in on the way."

We ran through the spaceport, dodging passengers and spaceport workers
alike. Security personnel cleared a path for us when they could. Tara
Lee must be pulling out all the stops.

We got to the departure lounge two minutes late but were hastily
escorted aboard. Panting, we dropped into our seats and felt the
thrusters engage before we even attached our acceleration harnesses.

When he got his breath back, Josh said to me, "What's going on?"

I continued to breathe hard. Josh was in much better physical condition
than I was. I made a mental note to check out the gym at the Womyn's
Cooperative Housing Authority when I returned. These sprints were
brutal.

"Emily Dickinson is being rushed to Aesculapius because he's been
poisoned," I said between gulping great amounts of shuttle air. "He said
I should go to Aesculapius immediately. He wants to talk to me."

"Is he going to live?" Josh asked.

"I sure hope so," I said. "He knows things, things he wouldn't tell me
when I asked him. Think they're trying to eliminate him, too."

Josh shivered. "That means you're next," he said.

I had not considered this, but Josh was right. Everyone connected to
Kearsarge in some way was being done away with.

"You're at risk now, too," I said very quietly, "so is Tara Lee and
perhaps all her staff. This is getting out of control. Too many people
know about this. Josh, do you have access to a network?

"It's not secure," Josh said.

"Do what you can. Send the data to Simon Parge. Send my case notes, too.
Tell him to figure this out."

"OK," Josh said, fingering is link. "You're going to owe me one of those
fancy wet wire links when this is all done."

"If I'm around to get it done for you, I will," I promised. p\>"I'm
sending him the decryption data, too. Can he manage that?" Josh asked.

"He can or he'll find someone to do it," I said.

Well, that was my backup plan.

"He's got it," Josh said. "He says you owe him some of your fee when he
figures it out."

"That would be Simon," I said. We were approaching the visitor's docking
area at the medical center. I had never been here before. I assumed the
shuttles landed at Over the Moon. I said as much to Josh.

"No way," he said. "They're at the South Pole. You don't think the
League wants to be that close to a legitimate business, do you?"

"I guess not. I there a way to get there from here?" I asked.

"There's a shuttle that runs in the evenings," Josh said, consulting his
link. "There are restaurants. A group of a certain type of person
frequents those restaurant. Your friend The Czarina is one of them. The
high rollers go there to gamble, too. People who come here for treatment
may go over there as well as their families. The rest of the place is
pretty seedy, like the neighborhoods off the very Lower Nile."

The Alexandria Space Station had its own freight docks, but that was the
legitimate side of business. The League could send interplanetary
spacecraft from Over the Moon there with contraband goods. Since it was
in-system, there were no inspections, no fees, no taxes, just a docking
and storage fee. It was said in Ptolemy City that more than half the
goods in our stores and food in our better restaurants came into the
city in this way. It kept prices down and expanded the amount and
variety of goods we had access to.

I followed Josh, leaving him to navigate the many hallways and connected
buildings of the Aesculapius Medical Center complex. All this was for
patients. No telling how big the facility was because it included living
quarters, laboratories, researchers, an entire medical school, programs
to train all sorts of people to do all sorts of things. I wondered that
there wasn't the commercial sector to sustain all their needs. But maybe
they needed to leave the campus from time to time and Over the Moon
provided that quick relief.

"Here we are," Josh said, touching a panel on a door.

"Please state your name and your relationship to the patient," the door
said.

"I'm Investigator Ronnie Camberwell," I said. "I'm with my associate
Josh Hardy. Patient Emily Dickinson requested to speak with me as soon
as possible."

"Please wait," the door responded, going no information about Emily
Dickinson away. For all I knew he was dead.

"Enter," the door said, and slid aside.

Emily Dickinson lay in a bed which was more hardware platform than bed.
I went to him with great trepidation.

"Emily Dickinson, it's Ronnie Camberwell," I said. "The Czarina said you
wanted to talk with me."

"A good woman, The Czarina," Emily Dickinson murmured.

"Yes, a good friend," I said.

"We help each other out," Emily Dickinson said. "You have to stick
together. You always need friends in Ptolemy City."

I waited, not knowing what to say to this, wondering how I could get him
to tell me what he wanted to tell me.

"That big pussy cat," Emily Dickinson said.

I knew he was speaking about Captain Star Runner. He always called Star
Pussy Cat.

"Its been a good friend to me even if I haven't always been a good
friend to it. You know, Ronnie, that big cat went all over the western
galactic arm looking for me."

I know, I thought. I was there.

"And now it's gone because of some trouble it got into with the other
cats."

Again I waited.

"But I guess you know all that," Emily Dickinson said.

"Yes," I said.

"I was sober, getting along OK on the Northern Frontier," Emily
Dickinson said, when someone from my past showed up on Grand Central
Station. He wanted me to do a job, a nasty job. I told him I didn't do
that sort of work anymore. I was putting all that behind me and living
right and proper. I didn't have the credentials to get back inside the
Solar League, but Gyllian said it might be arranged if I kept to the
straight and narrow for a while. She has contacts, you know."

Emily Dickinson was speaking of Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo.

"Yes," I said to keep him talking. He seemed about to drift off to
sleep.

"But old Dick York said I had to do it. That he'd make trouble for me on
the Northern Frontier. He said he knew people on the Southern Frontier
that could make things very difficult for me. All I had to do is go back
to the Pharaoh Star System and do this one last job for the Yorks. I
used to work for them a long, long time ago. They knew the dirt on me
all right, the warrants that ere still outstanding, everything."

"So you took Kearsarge's contract to assassinate Sam Mudd," I said.

"I had to," Emily Dickinson said. "There wasn't much choice in the
matter. And being back here in Ptolemy City, I got back to all my old
habits. No more straight and narrow for old Emily Dickinson. Just the
drunk I've always been.

He sounded quite plaintive.

"Do you know why they wanted Sam Mudd dead?" I asked.

"Oh yes," Emily Dickinson said. "They wanted him off Mark Antony and he
wouldn't leave."

"Why?" I asked.

"Dunno," Emily Dickinson said. "He wasn't cooperating so they wanted me
to blow him away."

"Why was Kearsarge killed?" I asked.

"Dunno," Emily Dickinson said. "Just wanted you to know someone poisoned
me for knowing what I do know."

"OK," I said. "I'll find out who."

"You're like that Pussy Cat," Emily Dickinson said. "You don't give up
on your friends even if they're just no good like me."

I didn't know I was such a good friend to Emily Dickinson, but he was
right. I would do my best to find out who was doing this.

It was too bad in a way. Emily Dickinson could have given Blake Redman
lots of information, even if it wasn't current information, but that
connection would never be made now.

Josh and I left the room. Emily Dickinson drifted off. The door said he
was expected to make a full recovery.

"Should we notify security?" Josh asked. "He could be at risk here in
the medical center."

"Already done," I said. "I've notified Tara Lee. She's contacting
someone she knows in the security office here."

"Good idea," Josh said.

"Are we staying?"

"I think we need to go to Over the Moon," I said. "Maybe someone there
will know something."

"You're not going to question Jean Jacques Roseau?"

"When I get back," I said. "Coming?"

"I wouldn't miss a trip to Over the Moon," Josh said. "I've heard lots
about it."

"Me, too," I said. z

I checked the time.

"We can make the first shuttle easily," I said.

"Let's go then," Josh said.

24.   We headed for the shuttle to Over the Moon.

25.   ## Chapter 23

26.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 22

The Czarina told me Emily Dickinson was being rush to the Aesculapius
Medical Center. He was ill and poisoning was suspected. Josh and I took
a shuttle there. I was able to speak with Emily Dickinson.

He told me Dick York of Fair Haven had blackmailed him into taking the
assassination contract on Sam Mudd. York threatened to expose Emily
Dickinson to the Southern Frontier and Northern Frontier governments.
Emily Dickinson did not specify what these long ago crimes were, but
they were serious enough for him to go back to the Pharaoh Star System
and execute the contract.

Emily Dickinson is expected to recover.

Tara Lee is providing security as Emily Dickinson may be useful for the
Blake Redman murder investigation.

Josh and I are going to Over the Moon Spaceport to see if anyone there
knows anything.

 

I put a video call through to The Czarina. She looked better and
appeared to be all dressed up and somewhere I did not recognize.

"That's wonderful news." The Czarina gushed. "I'm so delighted you
called me."

"Josh and I are on our way to Over the Moon," I said. "Any suggestions
where we should go for dinner?"

"Oh come to the Hey Diddle Diddle," The Czarina said. "Join me for
dinner."

Inwardly I groaned. How much would that cost me? I'd have to pay her tab
to get anything more out of her. Well, she had called me about Emily
Dickinson. If I wanted her to continue doing these little favors, I
would have to have her beholden to me. Well, having the Czarina on your
side is probably better than having her speak against you. She might
continue to be useful.

The shuttle ride over to Over the Moon was more like a tourist ride over
the unfiltered terrain of Hypatian. Our guide pointed out features of
the Cleopatran moonscape, including several crash sites and a large
chasm. He claimed no one knew how deep it was.

Finally, we arrived at Over the Moon and the prattle thankfully ended.
We were advised to make our reservations early for our return flight to
the medical center as additional shuttles would not be provided if not
everyone could ride safely on the final flight. We were also reminded
sternly that accommodations at the spaceport were both rough and
unsanitary.

Josh and I made our reservation for the final flight before we exited. I
had never heard of a hotel at the spaceport.

I quickly saw our shuttle parked in a reserved area. No freighters
rested nearby. The ships that were parked near us were well-maintained
yachts and a shuttle bound for the Ferris Lighthouse Spaceport. The
surface on which we walked was smooth, not scarred by use, fire or other
accidents or crashes.

We passed through a smart airlock into a carpeted elevator.

"I will bring you to the top floor of the Over the Moon Spaceport," a
disembodied voice announced as we began lifting. "You will have a
spectacular view of the stars. Restaurants include the Hey Diddle Diddle
for the adventurous and the Cat and the Fiddle for refined dining. Don't
forget to visit the Cow Jumped Casino at the end of the corridor. Please
step right when you exit the car and have a very pleasant evening while
you're over the moon."

"I think I'm going to vomit," Josh said. "This is all too cute."

"I wonder what is to the left," I said as we left the elevator.

"A set of doors," Josh said. "Should I try them?"

Before I could respond, he walked over to them. They slid aside but Josh
did not walk through. Instead, he laughed and turned back to me.

"The hotel," he said. "Aesculapius must like people to stay at their
facility."

"And what is it called," I asked, "The Dish or The Spoon?"

"It's called the Little Dog," Josh said, tang my arm. "The dog is
smiling, all curled up in a basket."

I laughed, too. It was a convincing picture of contentment. \<

Hey Diddle Diddle was not hard to find. Music spilled out from its broad
doorway. It was a robo serve restaurant with a floor show. I paused in
the doorway, looking for The Czarina. She waved from a nearby table.

"Czarina," I said, "have you met Josh Hardy, the security expert?"

"A pleasure," The Czarina exclaimed. "Is this your new beau, Ronnie?"

"Josh and I have been best friends since we were kids," I said easily.
"He's more like a my brother than my own brother is."

"Your brother is Kevin Camberwell, isn't he?" The Czarina asked.

"Sure thing," I said. "He's older."

Josh and I studied the menus.

"What's good here?" Josh asked.

"Everything is good here," The Czarina said. "The pirates eat well."

I saw a curiously named dish on the menu: S.L. Star Voyager Wilted
Spinach and Quinoa Salad (vegetarian). S.L. stood for Solar League in
the names of ships.

"That's it," The Czarina said. "There must have been a raid. You'll get
the same salad here that people who paid a great deal of money get when
they travel on the Star Voyager. It's quite a nice starship, or so I've
heard."

I ordered it. What the heck. I probably would never travel on a fancy
starship. Where would I go?

Josh ordered animal meat.

When I placed my order, I surreptitiously checked The Czarina's balance.
It was substantial, but not beyond my resources. I filed my expense
account daily and each day I was reimbursed.

"Thank you, dear," The Czarina said when she received confirmation.

"I'll hope you'll continue to invite me to your table even when I'm not
on such a generous case," I said.

"Of course, dear. I wouldn't think of giving you the cold shoulder," The
Czarina promised.

I wondered how true her statement was. Well, I'd probably find out some
day.

"Oh look who's here," The Czarina said, pointing discretely. "That's
Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan. I've heard they're a couple now."

"Haven't they always been?" I asked.

"No," The Czarina said. "Dagger Dan was partnered with Alluring Abigail.
She left him for one of the Rich and Famous who dumped her when they
docked somewhere in the Solar League. I heard he left her without any
credits. She can't make enough money to get out of the Coalition. Dagger
Dan refused to send her anything. He said she was pretty uppity when she
left so it served her right to be up the proverbial creek without a
paddle."

"And Posthumous Patty?" I asked.

"She's a wild thing. Most men give her a roll and come out of it cut in
several places."

"Dagger Dan seems to be in one piece," Josh said.

"He does," The Czarina agreed, "but I don't think it will last. I've
heard Posthumous Patty is going out of the Pharaoh Star System soon."

"Where?" Josh asked, playing the unsophisticated, incredulous kid he
looked like but was not.

"I heard she was offered a job on Fair Haven," The Czarina said. "I can
imagine what she would be doing. She's just an enforcer."

Bells started ringing in my mind.

"She's an enforcer?" I asked.

"Of course," The Czarina said dismissively. "With her propensity for
cutting people, she's a natural."

"Who does she work for?" I asked.

"Anyone who will pay?" The Czarina said, losing interest.

"Czarina, this is important," I said, leaning toward her. "Who has she
worked for recently?"

Immediately The Czarina looked thoughtful. Her zeroed out tab was
incentive. It would easily be in the negative zone by the end of the
evening.

"I don't know for certain," The Czarina said.

"Can you find out?" I asked.

"Perhaps," The Czarina said, holding her information close. "She often
works for very special clients.

"Special?" Josh asked.

"The power brokers behind the League," The Czarina said. She spoke
slowly, reluctant to give up information.

Some of the pirates worked independently. Some, like Captain Star
Runner, worked on contract. The people Posthumous Patty worked for
offered the contracts.

"Czarina," I said, knowing I was about to okay my trump card, "if you
know you need to tell me. I think one of these power brokers try to
murder Emily Dickinson."

My drama was spoiled with the arrival of our food. The Czarina steered
the conversation to lighter subjects, who was dancing with whom, how
people were dressed.

We ordered dessert. I needed to stay at The Czarina's table until she
answered my question. She demurred.

"Czarina," I said, "Tara Lee O'Rourke is providing security for Emily
Dickinson. She won't do that forever. When she withdraws her people,
he'll be vulnerable again. I need to know who has hired Posthumous
Patty. It may help me protect him from another attack."

"I've known Emily Dickinson a long time," The Czarina finally said,
"back when he was the best assassin in the Pharaoh Star System. He was
efficient. No terror. He just got the job done. We were never lovers,
but he helped me out when I was really in trouble. I guess I owe him for
that -- owe him more than money. You'll want to look into Adam Worth."

Josh almost dropped his coffee. Adam Worth was one of the richest men on
Hypatia. He was a known recluse and considered an upstanding citizen who
made his money legitimately rather than through nefarious activities. No
wonder The Czarina was cautious. He could make things very difficult for
her if he found out my source. And he could easily guess my source.

We didn't stay much longer at Hey Diddle Diddle. It was getting late and
we had a shuttle to catch. I thanked The Czarina and whispered in her
ear before I left, "We'll be as discrete as we can. Call me if you
suspect any trouble. Call me day or night."

"I will," The Czarina promised.

Overstuffed with excellent, food, we made our way to the elevator,
pausing to look up at the transparent dome over our heads. The stars
shown brightly with no atmosphere to get in the way.

"Is this what space looks like, way out between the stars?" Josh asked.

""The interstellar ships don't go out into space between the stars," I
said. "They go through the jump gates long before they get that far
out."

"I've heard the Pantherans don't use jump gates," Josh said.

"They don't." I said, "Their star runners know where to insert
themselves into hyperspace and when and where to exit."

"How do they do that?" Josh asked.

"They just know," I said. "Some know better than others. Some can find
more insertion and exit points. I've even been with Captain Star Runner
when Star got through a very old jump gate that was closed. They know
how to steer their ships somehow."

"But how?" Josh asked, still staring up at the star field.

"They're bred with that genetic component," I said. "I think the
original genetic code was developed at the beginning of space flight and
now it is engineered into each Pantheran that will become a star runner.
A quota is filled each year."

"And your Star Runner was engineered that way?" Josh asked.

"Yes," I said.

"And he's particularly good at it?"

"It is," I said. "Some Pantherans think it's because of Star's color."

"His color?"

"a fuchsia-colored Pantheran is quite unique," I said.

We missed several comings and goings of the elevator, just looking out
into space.

Star is out there somewhere, I thought. I wonder if I can see the stars,
or the light from the stars, where Star is traveling.

It was an odd thought. If Star were here, Star would point out the
location, if not the actual stars, for a constellation the Pantherans
call The Mother of Us All. Star believes The Mother of Us All protects
Star on Star's travels. When I questioned Star about this, Star said the
constellation was not the same as The Mother of Us All, just that the
constellation of a mother Pantheran signified their contact with the
divine.

27.   My thoughts were still on Captain Star Runner when we entered the
elevator. Because the doors at the back of the elevator opened onto the
foyer outside the airlock to the shuttle's parking area, we did not turn
around to see Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan step onto the elevator
behind us.

28.   ## Chapter 24

29.   Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 23

Note: Does it strike anyone as strange that these case notes appear even
though there seems to be no situation when Ronnie can write them?

At the Hey Diddle Diddle,The Czarina told Josh and me Posthumous Patty
was leaving the Pharaoh Star System for Fair Haven.

She also said Adam Worth was responsible for her employment in the past
as an enforcer.

I must say this astonished me. Adam Worth is one of the richest
individuals on Hypatia. He lives outside Ptolemy City in one of the
stand-alone domes. Captain Star Runner and I once lived in one of these
domes, but Star sold it when Star's business interests took Star
elsewhere. I neither wanted the dome nor did I think I could pay for its
upkeep. Star told me the upkeep was not prohibitive with geothermal and
wind energy available. I pointed out to Star that I did not have or knew
how to operate a vehicle which could safely transport me to and from
Ptolemy City. Star agreed with my logic and sold the place.

Adam Worth's dome is said to be palatial and is more a fortress than a
home. Worth is reclusive, rarely coming to Ptolemy City. People do
business with him at his residence which is called the Pyramid.

Besides being wealthy and withdrawn, Adam Worth was considered an
outstanding citizen, one who operated his business interests well and
without reproach. He was civic-minded. Many of the pleasant aspects of
Ptolemy City which the service worker enjoyed were said to be sponsored,
funded or recommended by Adam Worth.

The thought that he hired someone like Posthumous Patty to apply
physical pressure to people to further his interests shocked me.

Could Adam Worth be the person behind these deaths? If so, what else was
he behind? If Posthumous Patty was indeed shipping out for Fair Haven,
than was Adam Worth connected to the smuggling on Fair Haven and thus to
the Solar League?

I thought like most Ptolemy City residents that Adam Worth's business
interests were solely focused on Hypatia. He owned hotels, bars,
restaurants, casinos, that sort of thing. Now I wondered if he was
involved in the Mark Antony Mines and the theft of the antonium.

 

When the elevator doors opened, the disembodied voice said, ""Thank you
for visiting Over the Moon. Please proceed directly through the airlock
to your shuttle. You will find it waiting on the launch field. We hope
to see you again soon. Have a pleasant evening."

Josh and I stepped off the elevator and walked several paces toward the
airlock.

"Not that way," a woman's voice from behind me said. "Go to your right,
through that door. Don't make a scene. I have a laser and I know how to
use it."

I stopped, ready to argue, starting to turn around.

A searing pain touched my wrist. I grabbed my arm with my other hand.

"Believe me now?" the woman asked. "Get moving."

I wondered if there were security cameras. Surely this person would not
try anything like this if someone was watching. Then again, this was
Over the Moon Spaceport. Were there any security cameras at all? Was
there any security guards anywhere here?

Josh and I walked toward an unmarked door. Where did it lead? What was
going to happen? I had nothing of value. Well, that was not entirely
true. I did have my ray gun for all the good it did me.

A man stepped in front of me and touched the door with the words "NO
ADMITTANCE" prominently displayed on its solid exterior. It opened. I
recognized him. It was Dagger Dan, holding a very wicked-looking knife.
No doubt the woman holding the laser was Posthumous Patty.

We all filed through. Josh and I walked side by side, not speaking, into
the corridor beyond. Gone was the well-heeled coverings on walls,
ceiling and floors. This definitely looked like a maintenance area. The
floor pitched downward. We were walking underneath the ground level of
the spaceport.

I live in a domed city. I have the sense of being out-of-doors without
actually experiencing the out-of-doors. I have been on planets which
have atmospheres which can sustain human life. It is a very different
feeling than being in the controlled environment of the dome. I've
experienced rain, wind and snow along with the variations in temperature
and moisture.

I have also been aboard spaceships, on space stations and in other
confined areas. Nothing prepared me for the sense of being in an
enclosed space. This was not a corridor. This was a tunnel. The ceiling
was not too far away. The walls, floor and ceiling were made of a
substance I guessed was the ground of Cleopatra. Perhaps someone just
dug it out.

The tunnel appeared to be long abandoned. There was no sense that anyone
walked here. The most oppressive thing was the silence. No one knew we
were here. No one would ever find us.

Some time later,

Some time later the ground leveled out. There were lights above us, but
they were spaced far apart. Dagger Dan led the way. Posthumous Patty
followed. I assumed she walked with her laser ready.

Then the floor tilted up and we came to another solid door. This one had
no sign on it.

Dagger Dan swung it open.

"You first," he said, pointing to Josh.

I froze. What would happen next.

Josh walked forward. He was shaking, but trying to act nonchalant.
Posthumous Patty laughed, a hoarse, croaking sound.

"He's going to help you into a spacesuit, scarety cat," she said.

As I watched, that is what happened. Dagger Dan was efficient though
Josh was awkward, his fear making him stiff. I saw Dagger Dan checking
the seals, inspecting the gauges. It looked like he wanted Josh to
survive.

Next Dagger Dan called me. I tried to be relaxed, though donning a
spacesuit suggests we were going somewhere was there was no air to
breathe.

"Now you, Patty," Dagger Dan said.

Quickly Posthumous Patty -- it was her after all -- came into the room
and easily put on her spacesuit while Dagger Dan watched us carefully.
There was no way we could make a break for it. The suits themselves were
so awkward we could not have gone very far very fast. Dagger Dan could
be on us in a flash with his knife or Posthumous Patty with her laser.

Dagger Dan suited up, closed the door into the tunnel and pressed some
buttons. The air left our chamber and another door opened.

"Out you go," Posthumous Patty said.

We stepped outside the spaceport.

Foolishly, I had expected to step onto the surface of Cleopatra beyond
the dome. Instead, we walked inside the dome on the ground of the crater
where Over the Moon is located. There was no atmosphere. We passed by
parked spaceships. Correction. We passed by abandoned spaceships. They
were clearly abandoned as many of them were dismantled, had hatches
opened or were resting at odd angles. We were in a spaceship junkyard.

I wondered when they would kill us and how. When would anyone find our
bodies? Did anyone come here any more or had they stripped these
vehicles already of anything useful.

The ground was uneven. We only had starlight to see by. It was bright
enough but neither Mark Antony or Hypatia rose in the sky to give us
sufficient light to see details. There were lots of shadows.

Then I tripped. I did not see the odd piece of metal in my path. In the
ungainly spacesuit, I could not recover my balance. I crashed to the
ground, flailing wildly. No one could hear my shriek.

Then everything happened at once.

Dagger Dan turned around to see what had happened behind him. Posthumous
Patty stepped forward to look at me. Josh ran.

The two kidnappers froze. Logically, one should have gone after Josh and
the other stayed with me, but that is not what happened. They left me
lying there. Perhaps they thought I would not, could not get up.

But I did. It was slow. These were not very flexible spacesuits. I do
not know a great deal about spacesuits, but I do know what gear Captain
Star Runner keeps aboard Star's ship and it was not anything like these
suits. They were very tough. They could withstand impacts, falls and the
like. They were also easy to put on, wear for a long time and take back
off.

I got myself up and looked around. No one was in sight.

I made my way carefully to the edge of an old wreck. I looked down to
see if I was leaving footprints. I was not. I circled round the wreck,
keeping it between me and where I had last seen Dagger Dan and
Posthumous Patty. I could not help Josh directly. The only thing I could
do is stay alive and free in order to get help to him quickly.

I moved from wreck to wreck, peering around each corner, looking behind
me frequently. I was alone. I could hear no sound. The vacuum of the
junkyard prevented that. As far as I could tell, no one had turned on a
radio. I worked my way toward the spaceport building but away from the
door we had used. I needed people, someone to sound the alarm to rescue
Josh and collar Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan. I was definitely going
to press charges. I did not know what the regulations were for Over the
Moon, but I would press my advantage of being a service worker. That was
my intent of filing my investigator papers with the Governing Board back
on Hypatia. The Governing Board had some jurisdiction beyond Ptolemy
City though I was not thoroughly schooled in its application. Perhaps
Dad or Simon Parge would know.

Then I saw it. A simple thing really. It was a modern recycler. In fact,
there were several. It was logical, placing them near the junkyard. No
one would complain when they were started up or while they sat full of
dirty dishes, laundry and other types of waste products. If the
recyclers were here, access to the spaceport must be nearby.

I began scanning the spaceport surface. There it was. I had a long walk
with no place to hide. I took a deep breath which made me wonder how
much oxygen these suits had available. I moved as quickly as I could,
reaching the door. I pressed my gloved hand against the access plate.
Marvelous. The door slid open and I stepped inside. The door closed. The
door on the opposite side of the airlock opened and I went through to
find myself in a large room where the refuse of the spaceport was
collected.

A woman screamed -- or at least I thought she did. I really could not
hear her but I saw the expression on her face.

I fumbled with my helmet. I did not know for certain how to get it off.

"Who are you?" she demanded a bit shakily. "You're not Ralph."

"No," I said. "I'm not. I know this is going to sound weird, but I was
kidnapped and brought into the junkyard out there. My friend got away,
but I'm scared he hasn't found his way inside."

The woman looked at me. I half-expected her to think I was drunk and not
take me seriously, but she was a very practical person and, I found out
later, someone who had worked a good part of her life in the belly of
Over the Moon.

"I'll call Jake," she decided.

30.   Jake, it turned out, was the yard manager. The Yard turned out to
be all the parking area around the spaceport which was not filled with
breathable air. He assembled a team who searched the junkyard. They
found Josh hiding under a particularly mangled wreck. There was no sign
of Posthumous Patty or Dagger Dan. Apparently they disappeared when
their kidnap plan went awry.

31.   ## Chapter 25

2.     Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 24

3.     Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan kidnapped Josh and me. They
forced us out into the junkyard at Over the Moon Spaceport. I do not
know what they intended to do with us. We were both able to escape. I
summoned help from Over the Moon staff. They rescued Josh from his
hiding place. Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan have disappeared.

4.     Based on this experience, it seems obvious that Posthumous Patty
and Dagger Dan are responsible for the deaths of Kearsarge and Blake
Redman. The bigger question is: Who hired them. According to The
Czarina's information, Adam Worth may be behind these deaths. I need to
both confirm this and unravel the mystery of why.

5.     Properly speaking, I will earn my fee for just finding out who
killed Kearsarge. I don't know what proof consists of. To honor Blake
Redman, who I really liked, I need to learn why. If I get all of this on
record, Josh and I will be safe. Otherwise, we may continue to be at
risk. In my humble opinion, getting to the bottom of this mess will be
the only way not to be looking over our shoulders for the rest of our
lives.

6.     \*

7.     After my reunion with Josh, we went to find The Czarina. She was
still safe, but shaken by our experience. We bought her some drab
clothing and brought her with us to the Alexandria Space Station. I
checked with Tara Lee. The security guards at the Aesculapius Medical
Center reported Emily Dickinson was being released from medical care.
They reported no further attempts on his life. Tara Lee instructed them
to accompany Emily Dickinson back to the Alexandria Space Station.

8.     Simon Parge sent me a message declaring he had solved the case:
Dagger Dan and Posthumous Patty were the killers. If they were detained,
all my problems would be solved.

9.     Simon was correct as far as it went, but the why of it remained.
Simon was never interested in the background of a case. He was
interested in the culprits. In this case, it was obvious to me and Tara
Lee that Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan were hired guns.

10.   "I still can't place them on the scene," Tara Lee said. "I've used
face recognition on all the security records for that area I have, but
nothing pops."

11.   "Do you know how he was killed?" I asked.

12.   "I know he died of a mass heart attack," Tara Lee said. "The
doctors say there's nothing to point to a murder."

13.   "So yew can't pursue it?" I asked. This was incredible.

14.   "Nope," Tara Lee said. "Men of his age die of heart attacks. With
no sign of what might have induced it, I can't do anything."

15.   "No indication of heart trouble in his past?" I asked.

16.   "He had some history of heart disease," Tara Lee said. "With that
history, what happened to him is unusual but not impossible."

17.   "Do you think he was murdered?" I asked, wondering if she was
distancing herself from the case to keep her numbers good for the
tourist trade.

18.   "I have to put it down as death by natural causes," Tara Lee
explained. "I have no indications it wasn't based on the physical
evidence. Based on what you've told me and your experience on Over the
Moon, I can't help but think it was a deliberate act that killed him.
But officially, my hands are tied."

19.   "Unofficially?" I asked.

20.   "I'll do everything I can to help you," Tara Lee said. "I think he
was killed and I don't like the idea of anybody getting away with that
on my patch."

21.   With Tara Lee's investigation at an official end, Josh and I were
free to leave the Alexandria Space Station. There was no reason for us
to stay here anymore.

22.   Tara Lee was able to give us access to the staff canteen where we
waited for Emily Dickinson's arrival. I wanted to talk with him about
our experience and hear what he had to say.

23.   "So am I still under house arrest?" he grumbled when he joined us
at the table in the canteen.

24.   "They're trying to keep you alive," The Czarina informed him. "You
could be a little grateful to us for saving your life."

25.   "Can't say if I think that's a good thing or not," Emily Dickinson
groused.

26.   "Stay out of the Nefertiti Bar and your life might be worth
living," The Czarina said.

27.   "Ain't no business in the Pharaoh Star System who would hire me,"
Emily Dickinson said. "A man's got to eat, Czarina."

28.   "And a woman,, too," The Czarina said, "but you don't see me
moaning and groaning about it, do you?"

29.   "You're stronger than I am, always have been, always will be,"
Emily Dickinson said. His compliment both surprised and pleased The
Czarina.

30.   I looked at them both. Neither was young. I wondered what would
become of them.

31.   "I can hire you for at least this case," I heard myself say. "That
would give you a little money."

32.   "I don't need charity, Ronnie," Emily Dickinson said.

33.   "It's not charity," I said. "I think you can bring some expertise
to this investigation. You know some of the background and you know how
the Lower Nile business operates."

34.   Emily Dickinson considered.

35.   "So you want me to be one of the good guys," he said.

36.   "I don't know if I'm one of the good guys. I'm being paid by
Kearsarge just as you were. Is she one of the good guys?"

37.   "Hardly," Emily Dickinson said. "I take your point. OK, Ronnie.
I'll accept your offer even if I do think it is motivated by pity."

38.   I let that one pass. My only response would have been, "Captain
Star Runner would have wanted me to look after you. Star would have done
so." It was true but that did not make it relevant. I wondered if it was
my real reason. How much could Emily Dickinson enhance the
investigation.

39.   "I'm worried about us all," I began. "Three of us have had
attempts on our lives. I don't know how safe The Czarina is. I'm trying
to develop a plan to keep us all safe and at the same time find out why
we are at risk and who is behind all of this."

40.   "I can make sure your place is secure," Josh offered, turning to
me. "Could The Czarina stay with you for a bit?"

41.   I hesitated.

42.   The Czarina covered my hand with hers. "I know it's an imposition,
dear," she said. "It's only temporary. I'm sure you will solve this
mystery soon and I can go back to my life. I know the Womyn's Coop has a
guest policy. I would be happy to sign it. Should we take it week by
week?"

43.   The Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority did have such a
document. It allowed the womyn living there to have cohabitants move in,
especially male ones, but also gave them a legal way of having them
removed. This kept the cooperative primarily peopled with womyn.

44.   I took a deep breath. Even a week sounded like an amazingly long
time. I just wanted to be left alone.

45.   "Thanks, Czarina. That sounds like an excellent way to handle
things."

46.   Captain Star Runner would not like anything bad to happen to The
Czarina either. By proxy, it seemed, I was carrying out Star's wishes.
Was this really a good idea?

47.   "I can have the same policy at my place," Josh told Emily
Dickinson. "And no drinking either," he added.

48.   "You're a tough man," Emily Dickinson grumbled, "but I suppose
you're right. I can use all the help I can get right now."

49.   "So that's settled," I said.

50.   "Yes, sweetie," The Czarina said brightly. "Now you can get onto
your work."

51.   these endearments were going to drive me to drink.

52.   "OK then," I said. "Let's get on with our work."

53.   I quickly laid out my ideas:

54.   1.Adam Worth owned the Mark Antony Mines. The "Board" was a
fiction.

55.   He wanted to inflate the price of antonium in order to make a
killing in the market.

2.     He arranged for Sam Mudd to come to the mines to make that
happen.

3.     Sam Mudd used Jean Jacques Roseau to ship the antonium through
the Aesculapius Medical Center, probably giving Roseau access to some of
the antonium for medical research or equipment or whatever. In turn,
Roseau picked up the antonium and brought it to Over the Moon where it
was shipped out to Fair Haven and the smuggling routes into the
Coalition. With a corner on the antonium market, the smugglers could
charge whatever they wanted for the precious metal.

1.     The Fair Haven crowd grew restless for some reason. They wanted
Mudd out of the picture. Kearsarge was only a pawn who officially hired
Emily Dickinson to execute the assassination contract.

"That sounds pretty good," Emily Dickinson said. "That is how the Fair
Haven crowd would work."

"But Blake Redman told me Kearsarge's marriage to Sam Mudd was a lesser
royal family making itself more powerful by marrying a ruling family," I
said.

"Probably so," Emily Dickinson said. "The Benders have been in power a
long time. The Yorks would want to infiltrate that family for sure. This
gambit brings them a lot of power on the interstellar playing field. It
might have been too juicy to reject. Now that both Kearsarge and Mudd
are dead, that alliance is broken."

"Would they have wanted to break it?" Josh asked. "I'm totally ignorant
of this kind of family politics, but if the Bender family wanted to keep
out of the smuggling trade, they might accept the sacrifice of one of
their lesser lords for the well-being of the whole family."

"May be," Emily Dickinson said. "It has happened before. The Crowned
Prince may just have looked the other way when Mudd went down. But, if
it is in his family's interests, he may also use it as an excuse to go
after the Yorks. It can play either way."

"Is it relevant to our case?" I asked.

Emily Dickinson thought about it for a time.

"Probably not," he said, "if Adam Worth is the instigator of all this
and the one who profits the most. You can probably leave the Fair Haven
crowd to its own devices."

"But I heard Posthumous Patty was going to Fair Haven," The Czarina
said.

"Probably so," Emily Dickinson said. "Worth may still be in tight with
the York family. He'll break that contact if they can't deliver on their
agreement to dribble his antonium into the Solar League. He'll find
someone else to scoop up his antonium and work for him more
effectively."

"So you think fingering Worth as our master mind is plausible?" I asked.

"The Napoleon of Crime?" Emily Dickinson laughed. "For sure. Old Adam is
hardly squeaky clean as he pretends. I knew him when."

"So not only being an assassin the York family could blackmail," I said,
"you have the goods on Worth."

"That's about right," Emily Dickinson said. "I was willing to leave
sleeping dogs lie but apparently Adam is not."

"Do you think Adam has overstepped?" The Czarina asked. She had been
quiet the whole time, listening attentively to everything I said.

"He's always been ruthless with his competitors," Emily Dickinson said,
"but he has not gone after regular folks as a rule."

"So what has changed?" Josh asked. He was following the discussion with
great interest which surprised me. Josh was so involved with his neural
net technologies that what went on in the real world always seemed
secondary to him.

"I think Kearsarge changed everything," Emily Dickinson said. "She got
Ronnie here involved and that is a problem for him. Ronnie doesn't get
paid unless she finds out who is behind Kearsarge's killing. Simon Parge
may think fingering Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan is enough. Perhaps
it is for earn her fee, but Ronnie knows that's not the whole story.
Besides, she knows it won't put her in the clear so far as Adam is
concerned. She'll be watching him, knowing he's "not as clean as he
pretends. That makes her, and all of us, very dangerous to him."

"Because he values his reputation," The Czarina said. "He doesn't see
himself as a bad person. He is just a businessman and he wants to be
acclaimed as a great civic leader and example of what the freedom in the
Pharaoh Star System can do."

"So he's on a crusade against the Pantherans," Josh said.

"I think that's a little overblown,"Emily Dickinson said.

"But it is essentially true," The Czarina said. "A lot of Solar Leaguers
resent the power the Pantherans hold in the Coalition."

"Perhaps," I said, knowing well how the Pantherans could operate if they
chose, "perhaps we can leave the politics of the western galactic arm
for another day. What do we do to get Adam Worth off our backs?"

2.     ## Chapter 25 (continued)

56.   Silence greeted me. No one had an idea. Then The Czarina said, "We
need to have some evidence to convince Adam Worth to leave us alone. We
know, but knowing is not enough."

57.   "Can we go public with what we have figured out?" Josh asked.
"Would that be sufficient to put Worth on notice not to mess with us?"

58.   "I think not," Emily Dickinson said. "It just might make us more
expendable. We could seem like people looking to be paid off."

59.   "Really?" Josh asked. "Why would we look that way?"

60.   "The way Worth would spin it is like this," Emily Dickinson said,
counting his points off on his fingers.

61.   Emily Dickinson is a washed up drunk. He needs money to drink.

2.     The Czarina lives on gossip. She needs money to pay her bills."

Emily Dickinson smiled at The Czarina.

"Sorry, old girl."

"It's the truth," The Czarina said. "I can't deny that."

Emily Dickinson resumed.

"3. Ronnie is a disappointed lover with no prospects in sight after
having gallivanted around the western galactic arm with one of the big
cats. She has made up this fantastic story to grab attention."

My first reaction was to object, but Emily Dickinson's point was valid.
With the glitter gone from my life, a different sort of person might
just do something crazy to get into the headlines. Me, I just wanted to
crawl back into my hole.

"4.," Emily Dickinson continued, "Either Josh's business prospects are
poor and he wants free advertising or he's stuck on Ronnie and goes
along with her to score."

Josh laughed before I could react.

"Not in a million years would either thing be believable to those who
know us," he said, "but the general public would assume such statements
were possible. Ronnie isn't that kind of girl."

"Then I will go out to dinner with you when this is all over," I said.

Josh laughed again. "Then maybe all this has been worth it," he said.
"You know I was just teasing you about a date. It always flusters you."

"No, I didn't know," I said, "but I'm glad I do now. Shall we get back
to business?

"Josh, was there anything in the house AI's databases that could help
us."

"I haven't gotten that far into it," Josh said. "After you found the
messages to Jean Jacques Roseau, I stopped looking."

"Then that's where we need to look," I said. "I think we've imposed on
Tara Lee's hospitality quite enough. Perhaps we should go back to
Ptolemy City and start looking there. I also want to talk with Captain
Kidd again. He may know something he's willing to share with us."

"Leave William to me," The Czarina said. "If I invite him to lunch at
the Terrace, he'll come."

I opened my link. "I'll put something on your tab to cover a pleasant
meal with the captain," I said.

"It's been a while," Emily Dickinson said, "but I used to work in
Intelligence for the Solar League Navy. I suspect I can give Josh a
hand."

"I'd appreciate that," Josh said. "I'm good with the nets but the data
-- not so good."

"I'll look, too. Any reason why we shouldn't go to the house on Dollar
Bay Drive and talk with Arthur directly? Is there anything in his
systems that would prohibit that?"

"I'll check to be sure," Josh said.

"I so want to see that house," The Czarina said.

"It will take a little time for you to set things up with Captain Kidd,"
I said, "so you come along with us."

"That will be quite grand," The Czarina said.

I left the others and found Tara Lee in her cramped office.

"Thank you for your hospitality," I said, extending my hand.

Tara Lee grasped it, but did not let go.

"You're leaving us, then?" she asked, still holding onto my hand.

Tara Lee had small hands. I could feel them wrapped around my large one.
It felt very nice.

"Yes," I said a bit awkwardly. It is hard to carry on a nonchalant
conversation when someone is holding your hand like that.

"I wish we had more time," Tara Lee said. "I liked working with you."

But working did not seem the point.

"You must come down to Ptolemy City," I told her. My words surprised us
both.

Tara Lee smiled. It was a beautiful smile.

"I'd like that," she said.

"So would I," I said, feeling big and awkward. I usually felt big and
awkward. That was the thing about being with Captain Star Runner. I
never felt big and awkward. Of course I was much taller than Star, but
Star could stand on hind legs and look me straight in the face. I
remembered his cold nose, bristly whiskers and that rough tongue.

I stopped myself. Here I was suggesting a date with Tara Lee and
thinking of Star Runner. That would never do. Tara Lee was a beautiful
woman and I needed to give her my sole attention.

"I hope it's soon," I said.

Tara Lee squeezed my hand, then let go.

"It will be," she said. "I have time off in a few days."

"Then link up with me," I said "and we'll sort out the details."

Another smile, just for me. I hoped I would not disappoint her. This
could be something very sweet, something very special.

"Thanks for all your help," I said lamely, not knowing how to leave.

"My pleasure," Tara Lee said. There was another smile. She knew I had to
leave, too. "We couldn't pin Redman's murder on anyone, but at least I
know how it went down." She frowned and that was cute, too. "I just wish
I knew how it was done."

"If I find out I'll let you know," I promised. "I've got to go."

"I know," Tara Lee said. And then her link buzzed.

On an impulse, I blew her a kiss as she answered, turned and strode out
of her office, a bit more lightly than usual, or at least I imagined I
walked more lightly.

I would not have anticipated how important that conversation with Tara
Lee would be in the near future. She was, after all, a very special
womyn.

3.     ## Chapter 26

4.     1

Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 25

The autopsy results on Blake Redman indicated his death was caused by a
heart attack. As he had a history of heart disease, Tara Lee had no
choice but to declare his death accidental though she and I believe
otherwise.

Tara Lee O'Rourke was kind enough to allow my team to regroup and spend
some time planning our next steps.

We are a team of four now: Emily Dickinson, The Czarina, Josh and me. We
are an unlikely bunch, but collectively I think we have enough resources
to solve this case.

Emily Dickinson will bunk with Josh while The Czarina will come home
with me. It is all very awkward but Josh thinks, with the right
security, we will all be safe.

As we see it, Adam Worth has been orchestrating the death of Kearsarge
and the attempted kidnapping of Josh and me. We also believe he is
behind the theft of antonium, though properly speaking, it is not a
theft at all. We believe Adam Worth owns the Mark Antony Mines and his
removal of the antonium is to corner the market.

The York family is willing to sacrifice its connection with the Benders
to play with Adam Worth but somehow Kearsarge ran afoul of him. We still
do not know how or why. I consider that to be the final puzzle in this
case.

To get evidence, The Czarina is going to talk to Captain Kidd. Capt in
Kidd may be able to shed some light on Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan's
involvement. Worth does not work with the League of Hypatian Pirates and
that might be a way to gather some evidence.

Josh will accompany The Czarina. Emily Dickinson is sticking to me. We
plan to gather at the Dollar Bay Drive house to question Arthur.

 

I wondered what the Parges would think when I arrived at their door in
Pimlico with Emily Dickinson in tow. Mrs. Parge greeted him politely
while she exclaimed over my survival on Over the Moon. Simon shouted
from the other room for me to get in there quickly so he could put the
whole case to rest, collect a fee from my contract and put the entire
messy business behind us.

Simon's chair is mobile but he always acts as if it is bolted to the
floor. I wonder if the exercise of working the controls is too much for
him or he does not know how to operate it. The later seems possible, but
I think the truth of the matter is that he would appear awkward
maneuvering it in the house before guests. This way he can demand people
appear before him like the petty dictator he is.

"So you have a body guard now," Simon observed, seeing Emily Dickinson.
"Do you think you need one, little girl? If you kept your nose out of
trouble, none of this would have happened."

"I was hired to do a job and I'm doing it," I said, not rising to the
bait of being called a little girl.

"You didn't get to use your ray gun either," Simon said, continuing to
goad me.

"Not yet," I said.

"You'll find that your killers are Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan,"
Simon said.

"I'm sure they did kill Kearsarge and Blake Redman," I said. "What you
seemed to have missed, Simon, is that someone hired them to both kill
those people and Josh and me, too. I don't take that lightly. I want any
attempts on my life to stop."

"If you let it be known that you believe they are the culprits, you
won't have any more trouble," Simon insisted.

"But I won't have fulfilled the terms of my contract," I said. "It goes
back to the messages, Simon. And Josh has not fully looked into that
aspect of the case. We've been busy with other matters. Now we're going
to run that down and see if we can tie everything up nice and pretty so
I get my fee."

"And I get my fee, too," Simon said. "With all m help, it should be a
hefty one."

I held my own counsel on that one. Simon had basically not been very
helpful at all. With my wandering around the western galactic arm, I now
looked at the people I met here in Ptolemy City with a new appreciation
for their parochialism. Ptolemy City was not the whole galaxy. No wonder
Captain Star Runner always returned to Star's ship and went places and
did things.

Was this Ronnie Camberwell thinking these thoughts? I hated space
travel. But I finally understood why Star found life in the city
confining, not to mention Star's fear of open spaces. Star was a
creature of space through and through.

I wondered that my mind still turned to Captain Star Runner when I had
so recently found Tara Lee to be so attractive. Perhaps when we were
finally able to spend some time together, the joys of her exquisite body
would replace those in my memory of Star's animal presence. I hoped so.
I needed to get out of this memory loop that continued to make my daily
life linked to Star's.

"Simon, stop badgering the girl," Mrs. Parge said from the doorway.
"She's been through a lot lately. Come to the table. Don't be a bother."

We ate. I told Mrs. Parge about the top level of Over the Moon, about
looking at the stars and about the glitz of Hey Diddle Diddle. Mrs.
Parge was thrilled. The Parges never went anywhere.

"I'm off to look at data," I said. "We're meeting the others in Dollar
Bay."

"Which others, dear?" Mrs. Parge asked.

"Josh Hardy and The Czarina," I said.

Simon sighed noisily.

"I love reading her blog," Mrs. Parge said. "You must tell her."

"I will," I promised, making a mental note to bring The Czarina here so
Mrs. Parge could met her and The Czarina could have a meal.

"Thank you so much for your hospitality," Emily Dickinson said to Mrs.
Parge. "The pie was especially good. I haven't had such good peach pie
since I was stationed at Zeus World."

"The peach planet," Mrs. Parge exclaimed. "I've read all about it."

"Yes, ma'am," Emily Dickinson said.

We said good-bye and climbed aboard a caravan.

"Old Simon is as grumpy and narrow-minded as ever," Emily Dickinson said
as we settled in for our long ride.

"And getting more so," I agreed. "He was grumpier than usual. Mrs. Parge
took me aside to tell me how frightened they were to hear of my
kidnapping."

"He does have a heart," Emily Dickinson said. "He did a lot in the old
days to make sure people did not have to steal to feed their families. I
guess we all get reactionary as we age."

I was about to respond when my link buzzed with a priority message. I
made an involuntary sound of alarm when I read it:

Hope you enjoyed your meal in Pimlico. It's your last.

Emily Dickinson grabbed my wrist, twisting it to see the message.

He put his finger to his lips.

I understood. The caravan was the only possible way the sender of this
message could know where I had been. If that person knew where I had
been, that person would also know where I was going.

I wanted to ask Emily Dickinson if we should redirect the caravan or
even get out, but he made no move to do either. He just kept silence so
I kept silence, too. I did send the message to Josh and tapped out a
silent message to him for him and The Czarina to keep quiet on their
journey. If it was Adam Worth who was sending these messages, and I was
now more certain of it than ever, he would know our rendezvous would be
at 17 Dollar Bay Drive. Quite possibly he was going there, too. Well, we
just needed to be ready for him.

Emily Dickinson touched my sleeve, running his hand down my side. At
first I thought he was trying to fondle me, then I realized he was
searching my clothing for something. Belatedly, I realized it was my ray
gun. I reached into my pocket on my other side and produced the weapon.
He nodded and mouthed, "Be ready."

We exited the caravan several houses away from seventeen. Emily
Dickinson watched the caravan speed away to its next destination.

"I don't know if he can use the audio pickups," Emily Dickinson said,
"but he can access some of the other systems. You paid for the caravan.
HE knew its location and likely its destination. We will proceed
cautiously. Worth may be already inside."

"Can we trust the AI?" I asked. "It's pretty sophisticated."

"That depends on what Josh has done with it," Emily Dickinson said.
"Working with the Fungusian info is helpful but it's not the same as
knowing a system in detail. I will hand it to the pussy cat. Star always
was on top of the latest network tricks."

"I thought Stars AI did all that," I said, wondering again how easily we
fell into talking about Captain Star Runner.

"Some," Emily Dickinson agreed, "but Star had to be the boss to make it
do that needed to be done. Why Star once had to override a military AI.
I know from being aboard the cat ships that would not have been easy."
p\>I wanted to ask Emily Dickinson more, about Star and about a
Pantheran warship, but now was not the time.

"So how do you propose handling the house?" I asked.

"Let's wait for the others," Emily Dickinson said while we reconnoiter
the house. It's a nice house, by the way."

"Is it?" I asked.

"Not much ground," Emily Dickinson said, "but you would expect that in a
domed city."

We walked all around, but found nothing outside to indicate the house
held a dangerous occupant, or any occupant at all.

As we reached the front of the house again, the caravan bearing The
Czarina and Josh arrived.

"We haven't gone inside yet," I explained. "We were waiting for you. We
can't tell if anyone is inside."

"Why would anyone be inside?" Josh asked. "You told Arthur not to let
anyone in you did not specify."

"We don't know if Worth has overridden Arthur's programming or installed
any Trojans," I said.

Josh frowned. This was his area of expertise.

"It's possible," Josh admitted finally. "I haven't had the chance to go
through every system. It would be easy enough to hide something in one
of the subsystems, say, refrigeration."

"I have something to add," The Czarina said.

I realized we had not asked about her interview with Captain Kidd.

"I'm sorry, Czarina," I said, "I did not mean to slight you."

"I don't feel slighted," The Czarina said though I knew she was lying.
And she knew I knew.

"William and I go back a long ways," she explained. "He was more than
happy to have a meal with me on the Terrace at Shepheard's. He
reminisced about the old days when he could afford to eat there every
day."

"Enough with the good old days," Emily Dickinson said, "what did that
old rascal have to say."

"Don't rush me, Eberhart," The Czarina said. "I'm getting to that. If it
weren't for letting him ramble on and on about past glories, I don't
think he would have told me anything."

"Three pitchers of sangria helped," Josh added. "I was sitting at the
next table nursing my carbonated water. Could that old guy put it away."

"Focus, people," I said, feeling like a schoolteacher with an unruly
class.

"Well," The Czarina said, letting us all know she was ready to share
something quite important, "William says the pirates are very angry.
They have heard about the theft on Mark Antony and that the goods left
the Pharaoh Star System on a commercial star liner. They believe they
are being cheated out of their fair share. Moreover, they are shunning
Dagger Dan and Posthumous Patty because they are not living up to League
standards by their attempted kidnap of Ronnie and Josh. Josh and Ronnie
are doing well for themselves financially but the League considers you
both as service workers and you should not have been treated that way.
They are also upset over the journalist's death. He was doing his job,
too."

"That's good to know the pirates have my back," I said, "but does it
lead us anywhere closer to Worth?"

"I tried to get William to say something about that," The Czarina said,
"but he refused to speculate on who Posthumous patty and Dagger Dan were
working for. He said whoever it was, that person was trying to shut down
the League and none of the pirates would stand for that."

Emily Dickinson whistled softly. "Than that's Worth's game, to make the
League irrelevant."

"Who owns the star liner?" I asked.

"Worth Enterprises," Josh said. "I looked it up."

Can he really shut the League of Hypatian Pirates down?" I asked.

"If he pays the pirates more and charges the people who want to hire
them more," Emily Dickinson said, "he certainly can. The high wages
won't last, of course."

5.     So this was a bigger power grab than I thought. Worth wanted to
take over the Pharaoh Star System for his own fiefdom. The man was truly
crazy.

6.     ## Chapter 26 (continued)

7.     Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 26

Under Josh's watchful eye, The Czarina invited Captain William Kidd of
the League of Hypatian Pirates to join her at Shepheard's Hotel. After
several pitchers of sangria and listening to Captain Kidd's
reminiscences, The Czarina learned that the League of Hypatian Pirates
believes Adam Worth is trying to take away their business by paying
better and charging less. If Adam Worth can do this successfully, no one
will come to the League to do their dirty work. It will put independent
contractors at Worth's mercy. It would also make Adam Worth the de facto
owner of the Pharaoh Star System.

Although Emily Dickinson and I visited with Simon Parge, he could not
add anything to what we already knew. However, after leaving the Parges,
I received an unsigned message saying my meal at the Parges would be my
last. From this Emily Dickinson and I deduced that Adam Worth was using
the caravan system to track our progress.

We are all gathered here at 17 Dollar Bay Drive. We plan to go inside
the house to see if we can find tangible proof of our theory. We are not
confident that the AI Arthur has not been tampered with. This makes
entering the house very dangerous.

When I finished explaining to Josh and The Czarina, Josh said, "I think
I can disable the connection to the neural net. If I have to, I think I
can shut the AI down. The difficulty in doing that for us is that any
verbal commands will no longer work. I don't know how the house is set
up. Lights may not go on and off mechanically; we may not be able to
open doors, that sort of thing.

"Let's not do that if we can help it," I said. "I don't want to be
trapped inside."

"Do it if you have to," Emily Dickinson said. "This AI is a wild card I
don't like. These machines are very, very good but sometimes they
misinterpret the situation."

"OK," I said. "We go into the house. We stay in pairs. Czarina, you're
with Josh. Both of you, get out of the house at the first sign of
trouble. Get help if you can. Call my dad. Call Simon for that matter.
Call Captain Kidd if you think it will help. Just don't stay in the
house."

I turned to Emily Dickinson. "You're stuck with me. We'll go through the
house and see if anyone is waiting for us."

"I go high. You go low through doors," Emily Dickinson told me. "You're
younger."

"That's fine," I said.

Arthur let us in and reported the house was empty. Josh began going
through its systems, applying the Fungusian patches, checking for any
hidden subroutines, Trojans, viruses, worms, anything that could suggest
the AI was compromised. The Fungusian sniffers quarantined large
sections of the AIs code for further analysis, including setting up an
almost inviolate block to the neural net. Messages could get through but
they were analyzed to a fare thee well.

Emily Dickinson and I scoured the house level by level. We found nothing
until we reached the roof.

The flitter pad was visible from the doorway opening onto the roof. A
second flitter was parked there. I touched Emily Dickinson's arm and
pointed.

I mouthed the word "Visitor."

Emily Dickinson and I hesitated.

"Come, come," a familiar male voice called. "Don't be shy. You've been
looking for me. Now come onto the roof so we can talk."

The voice belonged to Adam Worth. I had heard his voice for years at
civic events throughout the year in Ptolemy City. It was Adam Worth who
gave me a metal for high marks in completing my police study. I took the
standard Solar League tests and scored in the top one percent. That
elite group each received a medal. It was still in a box back at my
flat.

Emily Dickinson gestured. We backed away from the doorway.

As much as I wanted to confront Adam Worth, I did not want to die under
mysterious circumstances.

I messaged Josh. Emily Dickinson and I hurried down a staircase we
noticed when we got off the bounce tube. We heard footsteps behind us.
The bounce tube might have been faster, but if the the column of air did
not gradually lower us down, we would fall all the way to the bottom.

Neither Emily Dickinson nor I was in good enough shape to run all the
way downstairs. Both of us were gasping for air halfway down. Worth's
footsteps came closer.

And then the very thing I feared happened. The lights went out.

I almost stopped moving down the stairs, but Emily Dickinson whispered,
"Keep going. Hold the railing."

I did as he instructed. Down I went in the darkness.

And then the fire alarm sounded. Flame suppressant foam dropped on us
from vents in the ceiling. We had to go very slowly down the stairs as
not to fall.

The beeping hurt my head. When would it stop? The fear of being pursued
by Adam Worth almost receded from my mind. We were in a burning building
and I could not see to find my way out.

At last we came to the last step and I groped for the door. It was open.
I expected it to be closed. This area should have been sealed off. All
doors are closed by a house AI when there is even a threat of fire.

Gratefully, I walked through the door. The gel was still spilling from
the vents. I made my way into the foyer.

Josh grabbed my hand and pulled me to the front door.

"This way," he said. "Emily Dickinson, can you follow?"

"I'm coming," Emily Dickinson said. "Worth is behind us."

"I know," Josh said. "It's all right."

When I stepped outside the door, I saw Kevin running toward me. He
brushed past me into the house.

"Adam Worth, you're under arrest," he called, "for the murders of
Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan."

I stared at Josh.

"Can someone be arrested for murdering a pirate?"

"They're not pirates," Josh said. "They were dropped from the rolls
after word came out of your kidnapping."

"Why?" I asked. This was all so confusing.

"Because the pirates like you," Josh said. "It's as simple as that."

"Did you know about this before?" I asked.

"Captain Kidd didn't mention it," Josh said. "My guess is he forgot."

"And they were just found?" I asked.

"Yes," Josh said. "They were found on the street, too, just like
Kearsarge."

Just like Kearsarge. Just like Blake Redman.

"Kevin," I screamed and ran back into the house. Adam Worth had a way of
killing people which left no sign of murder. My brother was in grave
danger. \<

Emily Dickinson and Josh were right behind me. I grabbed my brother who
was about to reach for Worth.

"No, Kevin," I cried. "Stay clear."

Emily Dickinson raised his blaster.

Adam Worth laughed. "I didn't get you the first time," he said, "but
I'll get you now." And he raised his hand with a small device in it.

Emily Dickinson blasted him on low power, running a beam of energy up
his arm. Adam Worth screamed and dropped the device. I reached down to
pick it up.

"No, sis," Kevin said, grabbing it with his handkerchief. (Kevin is one
of those men who always has a handkerchief ready for any emergency. It
amazes me.)

Josh stepped forward and grabbed Worth's injured arm, hard. The tycoon
screamed again.

The Czarina walked in and took both Worth's arms and pulled them behind
his back. She began tying them together with her chiffon scarf.

"Let me, Czarina," Kevin said, producing handcuffs

"I can't be arrested," Adam Worth said. "Do you know who I am?

"Yes," Kevin said. "Adam Worth, you are under arrest for the murder of
Posthumous Patty and Dagger Dan."

Two uniformed police officers burst into the foyer.

"Take him to headquarters," Kevin said.

"No," Josh said firmly. "The caravans are compromised. I'm crawling the
neural net right now. There's malicious code all through the caravan
system. Does anyone know how to operate one of them manually?"

"I do," The Czarina said. "I'd be happy to drive Mr. Worth down to
police headquarters. Perhaps, Mr. Worth, you'd like to give me a
statement for my blog."

"My arm," Worth said again. "I need medical attention. You can't deny me
medical attention."

"Now that's just a scratch," Emily Dickinson said. "If I wanted to
really hurt you, you wouldn't have an arm at all."

"The fire," I said, hearing the alarms again for the first time. They
had been ringing throughout this event.

"Sorry," Josh said. They shut off. "It seemed the best distraction I
could come up with on short notice."

"There's no fire?" I said, totally shocked.

"None at all," Josh said. "I got your message and thought the fire alarm
would be the best distraction. It was one of the systems in the house
that had not been tampered with. This AI is riddled with malicious code.
The Fungusian utilities are clearing it out pretty quickly. I'm getting
in touch with the city to see if I should lose it on the caravan
system."

"No," screamed Worth. "You can't do that. It's mine."

"Afraid not," Kevin said. "It belongs to the people of Ptolemy City. I
think you've been working against us, Mr. Worth."

"I'll ave your job," Adam Worth yelled. "I'll--"

We did not hear the rest. The uniforms had him outside and were frog
marching him across the lawn to a waiting caravan. The Czarina had
already opened a compartment and was making adjustments in the driving
mechanism.

All set?" she asked. "Next stop, police headquarters."

And they were gone.

"Dad's waiting," Kevin said. "Maybe you can explain this all to me?"

"It's a long story," I said, "but I'll tell you. It's a good long ride
back to police headquarters. Josh, can you find out how to drive one of
the caravans?"

"I can do us one better," Josh said. "The little AI in the flitter on
the roof is clean. We can fly."

By the time we got to police headquarters, there was quite a crowd.
Besides driving the caravan -- I must ask The Czarina one day where she
learned that skill -- probably in her days before being The Czarina --
The Czarina interviewed Adam Worth live. The video played through the
Pharaoh Star System and got very high ratings. It basically revived The
Czarina's career which had been languishing. Worth talked, trying to
convince her that he was justified in pursuing me, Josh, Posthumous
Patty, Dagger Dan and Blake Redman.

"The part I don't understand," The Czarina said, "is why you killed
Kearsarge."

"That one," Adam Worth said. "She was, if you will excuse the
expression, a bitch on wheels. She told me if I did not leave her alone
she would hire that washed up assassin Emily Dickinson to take me out.
Can you imagine someone having the nerve to threaten me? She did not
appreciate who I am. She wasn't like long-time residents of this fair
city of ours. She didn't realize all the good I do for Ptolemy City and
the Pharaoh Star System. She wanted to have me assassinated for just
doing my job."

"And what job would that be?" The Czarina asked, making an unorthodox
turn onto the Valley of the Kings and paralyzing the caravan system for
a radius of seven blocks in all directions.

"Making the Pharaoh Star System profitable," Adam Worth said.

"And how are you doing that?" The Czarina asked, tapping the horn. It
sounded like an elephant trumpeting. She was, after all, driving the
large vehicle known as an elephant. None of the residents of Ptolemy
City knew the vehicle had a horn. Children cried. Pedestrians gave the
vehicle a wide birth.

"I'm getting a good price for my antonium," Adam Worth said. "The market
was very depressed. I needed to find a way to increase the price.
Dealing with the York family on Fair Haven means I get a better price
through them than I did on the legitimate market."

"But you killed one of their family members," The Czarina said.

"Oh," Adam Worth said, "they'll get over it. It's money that matters.
Everyone knows that."

"And this messages that were sent to Kearsarge and Ronnie Camberwell,"
The Czarina said.

Worth laughed. "They were fun to write," he said. "Those two got all
upset when they received them. I had such a good time imagining how it
would be to kill them the way I described it in those messages."

"But that's not the way you did it," The Czarina said, turning onto the
street in front of police headquarters.

"No," Adam Worth said. "I did not want anything to be traced back to me.
I have this topical spray. spray it on. The chemicals get absorbed
through the skin and voil . The person drops dead of a severe heart
attack. Very simple. Very natural."\
\

If Adam Worth thought his interview would help his standing in the
general community, he was sadly mistaken. Placards called for his
immediate removal from all civic boards, for the restoration of privacy
on caravans and for the League of Hypatian Pirates to be free to
operate. It was going to be difficult to find anyone on Hypatia who
could act impartially in this matter.

8.     When I arrived, we received cheers. The city treated us as
heroes.

9.     ## Chapter 27

10.   The Final Chapter

Investigator Ronnie Camberwell's Case Notes for ## Chapter 26

We, that is, Josh, The Czarina, Emily Dickinson and I, gathered outside
17 Dollar Bay Drive. We thought the remaining answers to our questions
and proof of Adam Worth's involvement in the case would be here. We had
some real concerns: would the AI Arthur be reliable? Was there some sort
of booby trap in the house? Would Adam Worth or one of his goons be
waiting for us?

Emily Dickinson and I reconnoitered the grounds and there were no
indications of trouble. We went inside, splitting into pairs. Josh and
The Czarina investigated the AI. Emily Dickinson and I went room by
room, searching the house.

We found Adam Worth on the roof. He came by flitter. He threatened us
and we retreated down the stairwell instead of the bounce tube fearing
the bounce tube might shut down.

We alerted Josh who turned on the fire alarm which launched the fire
suppressant system.

We were able to elude Worth.

Meanwhile the police found the bodies of Posthumous Patty and Dagger
Dan. Dad, knowing of my concerns, sent Kevin to the Dollar Bay
residence. \<

Note:: This has to be cleaned up. Kevin's arrival seems too handy.

Kevin arrested Adam Worth for their murders. This was legal because they
had been removed from the pirate rolls. It seemed that Adam Worth was
trying to put the League of Hypatian Pirates out of business.

Concerned what Adam Worth's infiltration of the caravan control system
might be, The Czarina drove him to the police station herself.

The rest of us joined her downtown by flitter.

 

More revelations about Adam Worth's conduct came out as Dad's
investigation widened. I was able to participate in a small way, looking
through the data for more information about Kearsarge. I continued to be
paid.

The tension between Adam Worth and Kearsarge revolved around the deal
Worth struck with the York family. The Yorks wanted a larger cut. With
Sam Mudd out of the picture and the Mark Antony Mines seeking to build
op its supply of antonium, Adam could not coerce the Yorks into honoring
their contractual agreement. They literally possessed the antonium and
threatened to cut Adam Worth out entirely. He responded by sending
Kearsarge the messages and finally hiring Posthumous Patty and Dagger
Dan to kill her.

This was the first serious indication of Adam Worth's deteriorating
grasp on reality. Prior to Mudd's assassination, he operated
conservatively, but the antonium heist seemed to put him over the edge.
Tendencies toward psychopathy blossomed into full psychosis. He tried to
eliminate everyone in his way. He turned against Dagger Dan and
Posthumous Patty because of their failure.

With her new notoriety and contacts both on the Southern Frontier and
the Solar League, The Czarina offered me a good price for the house on
Dollar Bay.

"And don't be a stranger there," The Czarina told me though she and I
both knew I would not be a frequent visitor. We both knew we would keep
in touch, have the occasional lunch on the Terrace at Shepheard's Hotel.
The Czarina would be a useful source of information to me in future
investigations and The Czarina would come to me to see if I could verify
particularly juicy bits. She never did tell me how she learned to drive
a caravan.

I have heard Captain William Kidd moved in to the Dollar Bay house
recently. They make a fine couple. Captain Kidd goes down to the League
of Hypatian Pirates office every day. He must bring some interesting
tidbits of home every evening for The Czarina to work into her posts.

Emily Dickinson took the money I paid him and left the Pharaoh Star
System. I'll be back some day," he told me. "Bad pennies always show up
again. I just want to have some time to make a sobriety a habit. I can't
do that here."

Josh and I settled into a comfortable friendship. He used his newly
found expertise with and contact in the Fungusian Network to have a even
more successful neural net business throughout the Pharaoh Star System.
Many of the Rich and Famous came to him to design and install more
secure systems. Some of the more well-to-do League members came to him,
too.

Josh worked to straighten out the caravan code, making it more secure
and making sure no one else could use it to track individual cars or
listen in on conversations in progress.

As more and more revelations about Adam Worth came out and as The
Czarina reported on them to wider audiences, word of his shenanigans
reached farther afield. At first it was a local story. Then it spread to
Fair Haven. Quickly it dominated the headlines on the Southern Frontier.
Because of its connection to Blake Redman and the Solar League Examiner,
it became big news there, too. The Coalition became involved when the
extent of Worth's plans to dominate the antonium market became known.
The judiciary called on Hypatia to extradite Worth to Coalition space.
Worth fought the extradition. He said there was no legal agreements
between the Pharaoh Star System, the Solar League and the Coalition.

Simon Parge told Dad he thought there was an agreement and although it
was never found,, when the Pantheran warship arrived in system to take
Adam Worth away, no one opposed it.

"It's a bad precedent to set," Simon Parge grumbled to me one evening,
"letting the cats just waltz in and take someone away, but we're well
rid of Adam Worth. I never did like him."

I took this last comment with a grain of salt. Previously Simon sang
Worth's praises as an outstanding businessman, community leader and
benefactor.

Tara Lee and I are seeing each other when time permits. I have always
been an awkward lover, but under Tara Lee's gentle tutelage I am feeling
less so. She even got me to buy a dress. It must have been the right
dress because I did not feel self-conscious wearing it to the
Interstellar Hotel the last time she shuttled down to Ptolemy City.

I still think of Captain Star Runner often despite my relationship with
Tara Lee. I wonder what Star is doing, if Star is okay. I know there is
no hope of communication. Star's last contract took Star very far away.
Sometimes when I'm just waking up and Tara Lee is beside me, I am
surprised to find her sleeping there. I have been dreaming of Star
Runner. I am fearful she will learn about my ongoing attachment to my
former partner. I have not had the nerve to ask her if there was someone
similar in her life. In fact, I know very little about Tara Lee's past.
I suppose I could do some intense background checking. I have the
resources to do so. All I know from local databases is that she came
here seven years ago to head up security at the Alexandria Space
Station. She has done well there and the space station has a very good
reputation as being a very safe and secure place.

"I finally figured out how Blake Redman was killed," she told me. "That
device Adam Worth had when you arrested him--I think he had a similar
one in Redman's locker. It just sprayed him.

"Why wasn't there any evidence of it in the locker?" I asked.

"I think someone took it out immediately afterward," Tara Lee said. "Our
surveillance of the area is good, but it doesn't focus in on what anyone
is doing with any given locker at any given time. I'm looking for
funding to change all that, but people are uncomfortable with the idea
that someone reviewing or monitoring the camera feeds would be able to
identify what they were putting in or taking out of the lockers. They
think it will enhance their risk of robbery or bodily harm."

"I suppose it could cut both ways," I said. "You would have to be really
certain about your people and make sure the feeds were all locked down."

"The people I can be sure of," Tara Lee said. "The recordings and the
live feed, not so much. For every security measure there is a hack."

"rue enough," I said. Josh had recently told me a very complicated story
about a bracelet, a dog and a hack.

When I finally wrapped up the Kearsarge investigation, I thought that
would be the end of my career as an investigator. It turns out there are
lots of things which need investigating.

Animal Andy is having a problem with bad payments at the Treasure Chest.
He wants me to find out what is causing them.

The folks at Hey Diddle Diddle want me to look into a couple who dine
there regularly. Their payments register as genuine when they make them,
but when Dandy Randy, the manager of Hey Diddle Diddle, reconciles his
accounts, he ha snot received payment. Even the record of what the
couple ordered is missing. These two cases could be related, but the
people making the transactions are different.

I'm well-received in the pirate community. Why just the other day I got
a call from a well-known pirate -- I cannot reveal a name --- asking me
to accept a retainer.

"You never know when you'll need a top-notch investigator," the pirate
said.

The pirates themselves are gaining in acceptance in Ptolemy City. Under
the sway of Adam Worth, people was starting to think the Pharaoh Star
System's history of piracy was coming to an end. Legitimate business was
he way to go. Now the League of Hypatian Pirates are seen as reasonable
brokers who treat their customers well and operate, for the most part,
above board.

 

I am still living at the Womyn's Cooperative Housing Authority. I jumped
at the chance to sell the Dollar Bay Drive property to The Czarina. I
realized it was way too much house for me and it was too far from the
Tenderloin.

I am sitting here on my balcony, looking out over Lake Memphis. It is
late. Most of the city lights are turned off. Only street illumination
remains. This high up I can see the spots on Shepheard's Hotel, but most
of the lights from the rooms are out or the privacy screens have been
lowered. Ptolemy City is, for the most part, asleep.

I am watching the light from the many explosions which regularly occur
on Hypatia outside the dome. Red and yellow snow is falling. The wind
sweeps it off the surface of the dome. Stars shine down. I cannot see
either moon. Mark Antony must be chasing Cleopatra on the other side of
Hypatia.

I like sitting here in the dark, watching a familiar sky. Ptolemy City
is my place. I can be at home here, content with my life and with the
people in it. So many people come here to the Pharaoh Star System
seeking their fortune. Most of them are disappointed with their lives
before they come. Some are coming for financial opportunities. Some come
to escape someone else, some situation, some even come to escape the
law. Many also leave the Pharaoh Star System. It is not the panacea they
expected. They go back to the Solar League to make a new beginning
there.

I think some more about Tara Lee. She has been successful here. But is
she running from something? Will she stay? I have had no indication she
is thinking about leaving though she has talked about taking a holiday
outside the system. She anted to know if I was interested in going to
Three Ravens, the large, sprawling space station on the Southern
Frontier.

"I've been there briefly," I said. "I don't much care for space travel."

"Oh," she said and I thought she sounded disappointed, but she changed
the subject quickly and we have not talked about it since.

Maybe I should go inside. Staring at the stars always makes me think
about Captain Star Runner.

I get up to go inside. My link buzzes. Who could this be at this time of
night?

"Ronnie," a familiar voice says, "I probably have awakened you in the
middle of the night where you are."

"No," I said. "I've been sitting up looking at the stars, thinking
maudlin thoughts. It's probably good you called."

"Are yew sober?"

"Yes," I said.

"Good. I need your help. I understand you've been doing some freelance
investigating."

"The last time you needed help I was dragged all over the western
galactic arm," I said.

"This should be quite local," Colonel Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.

"If it is local," I said, "then what is your interest?"

"Need to know," Gyllian replied. "Are you in?"

I thought about it. Receipts from Hey Diddle Diddle and the Treasure
Chest just weren't that interesting.

"Sure," I said. "Tell me."
