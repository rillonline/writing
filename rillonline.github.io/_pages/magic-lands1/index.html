Standing with a group of Tigerfu females, I was the last one to be
called. We had all exclaimed with pleasure with the choice positions
everyone else had received. I was confident my posting would be just
as exciting and high profile as the others. You can imagine my dismay
when my class manager had no beautiful framed certificate for me.
</p>


<p>
The Tigerfu word for magic is misleading. As an heir of the Solar
League, I think of the word as a synonym for trickery in the real
universe and as a super power in the fictional one. Either way, magic
has no practical application for me, a former police detective,
private investigator and now a trained war crimes documentarian. I was
waiting for my assignment after completing War Crimes Investigation
School with High Honors when I learned the Tigerfu take magic
seriously.
</p>


<p>
"You are to report to the Director's office," he said.
</p>


<p>
"Why?" I asked. I immediately wondered if there was a problem. Was it
because I was human and not a Tigerfu?
</p>


<p>
"I don't have any more information for you," the class manager said,
turning aayand called the next name. My dismissal was final. I flushed
with embarrassment. With no explanation and no expression of concern
or encouragement, I was no longer a part of the group I had spent the
last two hundred days working with and becoming integrated into. The
Tigerfu are a pack-centric race. I was nowwww an outsider again.
</p>


<p>
I turned away, not sure if I should be. angry or ashamed. I thought
the Tigerfu were more open-minded than this. I had been encouraged to
apply to the War Crimes Investigation School for my different approach
to gathering facts and drawing conclusions. But appaarently, when it
came time to go into the field and make a contribution, the Tigerfu
higher-ups were having a change of heart.
</p>






<p>
Well, there was nothing for it but to gothe the Director's office and
receive the bad news. I wondered where I would go and what I would do.
I didn't think I could stand Janker's and Suchee's disappointment and
possible disapproval. Could their support have been false? I shook my
head. No, I could not believe that. After all, Janker had rescued me
on Transfer Point 17 in the Lystran Empire when it was coming apart.
Their concern and companionship was real. I was certain of that&#x2013;at
least, I was almost certain of it.
</p>


<p>
It is amazing to me how one bad thing can cause me to question my
place in the universe. Don't I have mor self-confience than this?Why
must I always question the loyalty of others? Had my mother's betrayal
made such an important mark on m whole life?
</p>


<p>
I shook myself&#x2013;a Tigerfu gesture for sure. I was thinking nonsense.
Perhap this was just an administrative wrinkle. I had forgotten to
affix my handprint to some docuent or other. The pawprint readers were
not designed for my human hand which made signing anything
problematic.I would have would my signed certificate and awesome
assignment in no time.

<p>
As I strode through hallways I focused on my training. As a police
detective and a private investigator I learned to ask any question I
needed to and expect an answer from anyone I asked. On Hypatia, I had
little actual authority, but I learned to act as if I had all the
authority I needed everywhere I went. Amog the Tigerfu, my physicality
did not command authority. I have only set of arms, wear clothing an,
even though I am tall for a human, I only come up to an average-sized
Tigerfu chest. This put me at a physical disadvantage so I learned to
project competence and autority.
</p>


<p>
I used all my skills as I entered the Directors office.
</p>


<p>
I was startled the reception area empty, but I collected myself and I
strode through the Ditors open office door.
</p>


<p>
"You wished to see me, Director," I said.
</p>


<p>
The Director had to look up at me as I stood before his desk. He was
old, his muzzle covered in white fur. His four upper paws trembled. He
was quite an intimidating character and even seasoned investigators
and staff were afraid of him. All I saw today was a very old Tigerfu
who trembled at my approach. Why?
</p>


<p>
"Not me," he stammered in a hgher than usual voice. "You are wnted in
the conference room," and he pointed behind me.
</p>


<p>
What was in the conference that even frightened the Director?
</p>


<p>
Again, acting as if, I turned on my heel and marched through the
Director's doorway and across the hallway. The conferene room door was
closed. I knocked with my knuckles, a gesture no Tigerfu could
perform.
</p>


<p>
A voice older and thinner than the Director's responded to my knock.
"Enter, Apprentice Camberwell."
</p>


<p>
Apprentice? Apprentice to whom or to what? My new title wa supposed to
be Junior Investigator. Nevertheless Ronnie Camberwell is my name so I
opened the door and walked inside.
</p>


<p>
I couldn't help myself. I stared at the Tigerfu sitting at the
conference table across from me. The word ancient came to mind. I had
never such an elderly Tigerfu. His hair wasn't just white all over.
It was so thin and almost dirty-looking as if all the newness of it
was gone. I could see through it to his skin. It was supposed to be a
dark blue, but even his skin was faded into a sickly gray. Most
surprising, the elderly Tigerfu was wearing a cloak of some kind. I
realized that without a full compliment of hair, the loak must keep
him warm.
</p>


<p>
"Pleae sit down, Apprentice."
</p>


<p>
I saw a human-shaped chair in front of me, pulled it out and sat down.
It was high enough for me to sit comfortably at the conference table.
</p>


<p>
"I am Grand Master Awk."
</p>


<p>
Although thin and weak, Grand Master Awk spoke with authority. He
might be old but I knew he was someone to pay attention to.
</p>


<p>
"I am your new supervisor. You have been chosen for a very important
mission, probably more important than all your classmates."
</p>


<p>
Well, that was something, but why all this secretcy? We all had
sufficient security clearances. I could not imagine I would be
assigned to a higher level project than what my clearance allowed.
</p>


<p>
As if reading my thoughts, Grand Master Awk said, "You have been given
a higher security clearance than your classmates. You will accompany
me to the Magic Lands where you will learn the magic arts and assist
me in our investigation."
</p>


<p>
It was rude&#x2013;I fully admit this&#x2013;but I laughed. Magic Lands? Learn
magic arts. Surely this was an elaborate joke. I told Awk, or whatever
his name was, so.
</p>


<p>
"No, Apprentice," he said. His tone implied both patience and
gravitos. "This is quite a serious matter. Magic is real in the Magic
Lands.
</p>


<p>
"Not all people can learn to perceive magic much less perform it. All
students are tested. We do not advertize this fact because of the
derision it causes. You are not alone in your skepticism.
Nevertheless, I can assure magic is real in the Magic Lands and if not
arefully regulated, can be put to neferious and dangerous uses. This
is what we think is happening at one of our facilities and I need your
help to catch the perpetrators and stop them."
</p>

<p>
I didn't know what to say. For a reason I could not name, Grand Master Awk frightened me. There was something very strange about this ancient Tigerfu. Perhaps it was just because I had never seen such an elderly individual. His talk about magic was equally unsettling. I would have thought he was delutional except he frightened the Director.
</p>


<p>
I took a deep breath.
