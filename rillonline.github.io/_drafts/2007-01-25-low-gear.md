<p>It's very cold today in Jamestown and is supposed to get into the single digits tonight. As a result, the snow is still here and it keeps flurrying.
<p>Elwood was excited to go somewhere this morning. He puts it into low gear, that is, he pulls very hard but isn't going particularly fast as if he is down shifting. He did fairly well turning at the corner of Main and 3rd though he had trouble finding the up ramp. We just went over the curb on the Main Street side. Not his fault. There's snow covering the curb.
<p>A woman driving down Main Street stopped to tell me he was holding his left foot up. She thought it might be cold. I think it may have had some salt in between his pads. The walk around the bank and the street were very gritty.
<p>Eric was shoveling when I got to church. Their curb has been very clear.
<p>I put the gentle leader on. Elwood stayed down for most of the service, even during anointing for healing. Very impressive.
<p>He also settled down nicely for Bible study without it on. Maybe he's getting this church thing a little.
<p>Our walk home went well. He's starting to figure out where the curbs ought to be on the return trip at 4th and 3rd. He was still proceeding in low gear.
