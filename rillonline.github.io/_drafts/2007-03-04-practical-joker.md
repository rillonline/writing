<p>A friend dropped by. Elwood ran to the door.
<p><q>Oh my goodness!</q> my friend exclaimed. <q>Elwood must have needed to go out. The carpet is now wet all down the hall.</q>
<p><q>That's funny,</q> I said. <q>He didn't pester me to go out which he normally would do.</q>
<p>Being a good friend, she went into the kitchen to get some paper towels and discovered the trail of liquid led to the water bowl. How odd. Then she looked at Elwood, still clutching his kong in his mouth which was still dripping water onto the carpet. No accident at all.
<p>The kong is designed in graduated rings with both top and bottom open. Some people hide treats inside especially peanut butter. Who would give a dog peanut butter I don't know. I can't stand the stuff.
<p>So now I know ... Elwood has the makings of a practical joker.
