Nick and I finally got out for a walk today. I tried using my Apple Watch. It routed us in a particular direction and I didn't go that way. From the taps on my wrist, GPS wasn't very accurate when approaching the street. user 25 draft draft Nick was ready to go fast, but he was also very careful today. He knows where he had encountered ice before and went very carefully so I didn't fall. When we got further down Elmwood, Emma, I dog we had met before, started barking at us across the street. Nick looked. When I told him to concentrate, he did, and he was careful to show me some ice at the curb. I miss judged at one point, and turned him away from the direction he was going, but he was correct and we resumed our walk home. He asked if we wanted to go to the Hubbard Avenue diner, but was content when I said no. Still loving my smart lock. It off opens just as I approach the door. I can hear the ding on my phone. We walked not quite a mile. Not a bad start getting into a regular walking routine again. I've had a cold. It's been icy and extremely cold. But now, we should be good for a few days. This is Saturday. Cold again on Wednesday when we have several appointments and need to be out and about. Dress warmly, I guess. I am reminded that I have to start wearing my gloves and scarf. It was a bit windy and I was a bit chilly. it is so great to work with and eager dog who is quick to learn.
