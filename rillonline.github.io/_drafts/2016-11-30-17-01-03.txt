Advent began last Sunday; however, my Advent hanging expects Advent to start on December 1st. To be in sync with putting decorations on my handmade Christmas tree on the hanging, I will observe Advent this way.

Advent precedes Christmas as a season of preparation as Lent provides a time of reflection and prayer before Easter.

Advent means *coming* or *visitation* of an important person. The important person, in this case, is Jesus.

Advent holds two visits in mind:

1. Rehearsing Jesus' birth.
2. 22. Jesus' return.



I'm usually in the return camp. All the Baby Jesus is sentimental. But as I pause, I may be coming around to focusing on the Incarnation--

* The Word of God becoming flesh


* God is Immanuel--God is with us in all the sordidness of our lives



Jesus' return emphasizes judgment and justice. God's reign will begin.
