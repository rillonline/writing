<p>I had fun today. I wrote an email to Elwood's sister Eiffel in his name, detailing Elwood's recent activities and sending sis birthday greetings. I just received a response in Eiffel's name for Elwood. Elwood seemed uninterested while Eiffel detailed her helpful ways ... picking up paper and removing socks from laundry hooks. Good news ... Eiffel is getting on well with the previous dog guide, Valerie, a golden retriever.
