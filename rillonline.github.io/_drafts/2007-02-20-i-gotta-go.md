<p>When I untied Elwood this morning in preparation for going out, he began dashing wildly about, up and down the hall. Up onto the braille printer, hitting the form feed button. Back down the hall and back, knocking over the floor lamp. Another turn and more paper spewed forth. Finally, the leash was attached and he made it out in the knick of time.
<p>Upon his return to the apartment, he continued to be excited. fortunately, none of his restlessness  was destructive. He simply had trouble settling down to go to his place so I could start preparing his breakfast.
<p>Once he was fed, he was his gentle self.
<p>I guess that's what happens when you don't poop at dinnertime or bedtime. You're raring to go the next morning in more ways than one.
