<p>No, not that spring! It's 20 something outside, snow-covered and probably more snow on the way. The lake isn't frozen and has to get another 10 degrees colder in order to freeze.
<p>The spring I'm talking abut is the one that causes Elwood to jump up. He was especially springy at church on Saturday. I didn't think about his gentle leader. This week was much springier than last so it will become pro forma to have him wear it.
<p>The gentle leaders are worn much tighter. I think it has something to do with pressure points. It's supposed to calm the dog. Calm in church would be good.
<p>Sunday we went out. I stood at the curb. Elwood did his thing off the curb. All was going well until Elwood bounced on long leash. There was a pole and me and him and then I was down. Despite the snow, sidewalks are hard. Elwood was a bit surprised but not upset. I got up. We got ourselves back together again.
<p>So far, we haven't had a repeat which is very good.
<p>I transferred the big bag of food into the new plastic container with locking lid. Elwood couldn't resist an open bag of dog food so I'm pleased the new container holds it all. I can lift a full container, too, so can put it up where he can't figure out how to open it. I don't know if he can figure it out but I don't want to know.
