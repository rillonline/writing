<p>Safe streets have taken on a whole new meaning to me this week. We did not get the snowstorm of many inches of snow that was coming this way. Instead, we got an inch or thereabouts which basically means it's inconvenient to walk around town.
<p>Today, being clear though cold, I bundled up in hat, scarf and gloves to take Elwood out. While out, I decided a walk would be possible given that no percipitation was falling.
<p>We walked down Pine Street. Clear in spots but very icy in others. We turned at 2nd. The same. We walked up Main. Not bad. When we got to 3rd, Elwood made a quick right-hand turn back to the apartment. I had planned to walk up to 4th, but well, if he wasn't interested ... When we crossed Pine, it was clear to me Elwood was planning on going home.
<p>I don't know if Elwood just thought I was disoriented and took the long way home or wether he judged the streets to be unsafe. In the first case, I'm dumb. In the second, he's smart. Elwood didn't worked in snow  as part of his training. He may just think it is an aboration to be endured before better working conditions materialize. He could be right.
