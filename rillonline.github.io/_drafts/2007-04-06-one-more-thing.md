<p>While we still had warm weather, the fire alarm in my building went off. It was 10:30 at night. What to do? Was it just burned toast?
<p>I pulled on some clothes, got Elwood and my purse, and went down the back stairs. This seemed the most direct if not the easiest way out. Around threw the alley and up to the front of the building to find 4 or 5 emergency vehicles and my neighbors. They checked the building. There was the smell of paint or polyurethane but no fire. We all went back in.
