<p>It continues to snow here and be very, very cold--single digits on the radio this morning. The lack of sidewalk shoveling also continues. In areas there is salt so there is slush. The salt really bothers Elwood, getting into his pads.
<p>Today we needed to run an errand. Elwood is getting the hang of this snow ting and walking where the snow has been trodden down, pretending that there is a sidewalk.
<p>I would think making downtown walkable in bad weather would enhance the downtown area but no one else puts this idea into action.
<p>I have also discovered a trick of Elwood's and I am trying to put a stop to it. When I come in, I had been unharnessing him and letting him dash off while I got my coat and boots off. No longer. He is required to wait until I get undressed before his harness comes off. Then he is sent to his place because ... Elwood has been dashing into the kitchen and jumping up onto the counter while I was at the door and couldn't see him.
