  <p>Sunday was a busy day though no trips are scheduled. Several of us went out on the leisure path in the morning. I went twice around--2/3 of a mile.
<p>Gail and Pete came. We went out on the leisure path and did a turn, then came inside. When the lounge got crowded, we went back outside. Very mild weather here and there was a bench in the sun. Pete passed on another turn round the path, but Gail and I persevered.
<p>After supper, I went for a night walk in Morristown. Elwood has never worked at night and sometimes I walk in the dark, especially in winter. He did great. I even had the sense I knew where I was since we traveled on the same streets but in a different configuration.
<p>I had a chance to ride in a mini van and review dog-in-car. With air bags, it will be important for Elwood to lay down while traveling. It is being recommended that traveling longer distances in a crate is helpful. All the puppies have been crate trained.
<p>This morning we were awakened to Garth Brooks and "Low Places". walked around the courthouse. We got to go through two metal detectors which was the real point of the exercise as well as working through some groups of people.
<p>Elwood went to the vet because of a bump near his eye. It's being analyzed, but the vet thinks it is a pimple. I guess when you're a teenager, you get acne even if you are a dog! Actually, they are calling it a whitehead.
<p>We went through a revolving door, walked inbetween two men having a heated discussion about football and that was Monday so far as trips go.
<p>In the evening we had a long lecture. One of the instructors was giving us some history. <q>I can't remember our founder's first husband's name,</q> she said. <q>All I can remember is his last name: Wood.</q> <q>It was L.</q> I said. <q>Oh,</q> she said, <q>L-Wood?</q> The class broke up. The instructor took a while to get it. As it turns out, the man's name was Walter Woods.
<p>Tuesday was a zoo. First, we had to put the dogs' booties on for a walk in style.. Then we went to the coffee shop--two drinking coffee while the other one worked. I was last to work. Elwood had been good--because he was busy chewing a hole in one of his booties. He did great work in one of the stores with tight clearances.
<p>I met a woman on the street who asked how I knew she was there. I didn't--just that Elwood was sniffing something.
<p>In the afternoon, I had my exit interview with the president, went to the vet to hear about Elwood's health history and our class went for ice cream Sundaes.
<p>Our instructor thought it would be good to do some sedan work. We had one person and one dog in front, a second dog and person in the back and I was also to get into the back seat with Elwood. I got in. Elwood got in. The dog already there thought it was a bit tight and growled. The instructor decided to <q>spin</q> Elwood around, which meant Elwood was on my lap while spinning. However, he didn't quite fit because when we closed the door, he jumped onto my lap. We got in the van to go to town.
<p>When we went for ice cream, I went outside but didn't know where the van was. Another classmate joined us. A classmate in the van called to us. <q>Oh, no,</q> I thought. <q>She's driving!</q>
<p>Today the local students go home. An instructor drives them and settles them in. We are all frantically figuring out how to get everything in our suitcases including 8 pounds of dog food.
<p>Last night at park two of us stepped in our dog's output. We were instructed to come to the wall and hold up our shoes for inspection. <q>not like that,</q> the instructor said. <q>Like a horse.</q> He untied our offending shoes and left us there, one shoe off, one shoe on, holding onto the wall. He was gone a long time. Water wasn't enough to get my shoe clean. It is still quite wet. Fortunately, I have another pair of shoes!
