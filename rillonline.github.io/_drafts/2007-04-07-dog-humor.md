<p>Dogs have a sense of humor. They do things and they're funny. I don't know if the intent is to make you laugh. I rather think it is to demonstrate how clever they are and how tuned into what humans intend to do they are.
<p>Today Elwood enacted one of those practical jokes dogs are so good at. I had been sorting the laundry, adding to a pile of clothes on the floor. When the pile was of sufficient size I intended to throw it into the washer. Well, this time arrived. I went to the pile only to discover a dog sprawled out on top of it. Ha~! Ha! I'm on the laundry you want to put into the washing machine. I don't know how he managed it. I was able to get all the laundry out from under him without Elwood moving. Maybe he moved when I was at the machine. I don't know. It's all mysterious.
