<p>I buy breakfast sausage links. They're precooked and frozen. When I want sausage with my soft boiled egg in the morning, I take the package out of the freezer. The links are all lined up, five to a row and two rows in a package. With a knife, I break off how many sausages I want to microwave.
<p>This time, however, when I pressed down on the knife, one frozen sausage flew off the kitchen counter and landed in Elwood's water bowl.
<p>Now both dogs and people know the rules about food:
<ol>
<li>Anything that hits the floor legally belongs to the dog.</li>
<li>Anything in the dog's dish is definitely the dog's.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the frozen sausage in Elwood's water bowl was his. Rinsing something off which has fallen onto the floor is one thing. Retrieving food from a dog's bowl is another.
<p>So Elwood had a suasage popcycle for breakfast, after his own healthy dog breakfast.
<p>The only problem is-- He now watches closely any time I take more sausages out of the freezer. He will no doubt do this forever because, you never know, one may fly off the kitchen counter and land where it's legal to grab it.
<p>I'm just grateful I don't have sausage popcycles in my freezer for me. It just sounds yucky  though he was happy enough to crunch his.
