<p>It continues to be <strong>very</strong> cold here, single digits at best with wind chills -20. Elwood shivers a lot. I keep trying different gloves for ones that will keep my hands warm and ones that will let me buckle the harness without taking them off. These do not tend to be the same gloves.
<p>We were able to get out and go for lunch. Elwood was excited to get some work in and behaved well at the restaurant. His guide work was very good, too.
<p>After dinner--Elwood's, that is--the power went out. I hadn't had supper. Elwood didn't understand why I wasn't putting the lights back on. My apartment dropped 2 degrees in 20 minutes. The power was out for about a half an hour. The radio on the a.m. band in this area was out, too. Philadelphia was coming in loud and clear which wasn't helpful at all. I understand the local fm station was on, but I couldn't pick it out from the rest.
<p>Elwood is starting to get the hang of curling up under the table. The other day I called him but he didn't come. I called several times with corrections. Still no Elwood but much noise. I went to see what he was up to. He had gotten tangled in the speaker wires and was stuck. We straightened that out and he happily came with me.
