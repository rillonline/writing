<p>Today we walked around the neighborhood. I totally missed Pine Street on the other side of 3rd. I will have to re-educate Elwood that this is not a pedestrian mall as I had originally indicated. I figured it out when we had walked too far and then came to North Main.
<p>We are still working on the park issue. At the curb is working best and will be more practical long term. We just couldn't practice at the Seeing Eye. It's the moves which we could have practiced along with the cars, stationary and otherwise, we we couldn't practice. Elwood is eating though I cut back his food since we are not on school schedule so sooner or later something has to happen.
<p>We went to the 5 o'clock service. Elwood thought it was quite peculiar that I wanted him to turn right after the building and didn't understand that the sidewalk with steps was his goal. I am teaching him to lay under the pew. Elwood was not thrilled about this. I spent a lot of the service putting him back in position. Fortunately, Episcopalians believe in assigned seats so I will be able to teach Elwood where to sit.
