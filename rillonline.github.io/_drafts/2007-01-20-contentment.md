<p>Elwood really likes being curled up between my feet. No climbing. No poking at my hands bone in mouth while I try to use the keyboard. I will end of using this laptop computer in my lap.
<p>Yesterday I put him on tie down while I talked with someone. He whimpered and fussed until I settled him down. Then he was quiet, for about an hour. He is getting to be like most people--a service lasts an hour so at the end of that time, let's get on with it.
<p>Elwood did very well this morning by identifying the street despite the snow covering. This is very gratifying. I depend on my dog to identify walks and streets when they are snow-covered or poorly defined. He's really coming along.
