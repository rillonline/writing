<p>Actually, it's a nightmare. Significant snow but now plowed. Cold. I had to drag out my heavy coat, boots, gloves and hat. Yuck! Especially since shirt-sleeve weather proceeded it.
<p>While the good weather lasted, Elwood and I were going on several walks a day which I thought would be good for both of us. He plagues me with his bone if he is not tired. I have been quite cross with him and of course he doesn't understand why. Then I feel bad and apologize and he goes and gets his bone again. It's hard to do anything when being poked with a bone. If I knew the game it would help. He is bringing his bone for outdoor play every time we go out--still.
<p>Last night we went to church, having gotten rides to and from. I could have never walked it with reasonable safety. When we got into the church, Elwood jumped up onto the pew cushion and began parading back and forth. I got him back down into the aisle. We entered the pew again and again Elwood jumped up and pranced on the pew. Someone offered the short pew where wheelchairs can be placed. No, we would get this right--dog on floor, person on pew. Three was the charm. He managed to do it right after coming back from Communion, too. What a relief. Now all we have to do is get through Easter morning church. We've never participated in the gospel procession before. At least there are no pews to jump on.
