<p>A crazy day yesterday, Christmas Eve. Morning worship in Fredonia. Elwood was fantastic.
<p>Elwood does not care for baking. It means he has to watch from his tie down and I take forever!
<p>Then on to a festive supper with friends. They had cats--cats who wanted to play with Elwood's tail!
<p>Then the service... We went early because our ride had to be at choir practice. Elwood doesn't care for classical music in the big church. He was very antsy. Also, people kept coming over and that made him bouncy, too.
<p>Then waiting, waiting, waiting while the special music was performed before the service. I have only encountered this in Jamestown.
<p>Then onto the service itself. I read. Elwood bounced around. I kept focused on the reading.
<p>Then he laid quietly throughout the rest of the service. Curiously, no one fetched us for communion.
<p>Then more waiting around for the ride home. I would have had us walk, but we had stuff to carry.
<p>A late night park (actually, at 1 a.m., and we slept in.
<p>Now we're off to a.m. service and communion, I hope.
<p><strong>Merry Christmas!</strong></p>
