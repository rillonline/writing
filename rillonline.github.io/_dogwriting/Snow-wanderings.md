### Date: December 23, 2016

it is snowing again. I took Nick out. When he's on the leash and the snow is covering the ground, it is very difficult to keep my bearings. Fortunately, I can usually tell where my apartment building is. However, if I move from where I walk out into the snow, and I usually do, it is hard to know where I am when I come back to the sidewalk. Tonight I miss judged. I ended up underneath the wooden staircase that leads up to the second story. I bumped into several posts and treds, getting my hair full of very wet snow. Poor Nick got himself tangled with the leash under the stairs. It was on the lower stairs, though and I couldn't finish the leash out. So I found Nick, and then pulled the leash through. Fortunately, it did not hang up. I am learning to keep my door open – – the apartment is very warm so this is actually helpful – and my music was playing. I found the way to get back inside.
