On Saturday Nick and I finally got out of the house. We were able to walk to the library and back. Nick is starting to get a really good feel for icy conditions. He is very cautious. I need to encourage him a lot.

as we went along, Nick stopped for no apparent reason. Halfstep by half step, we inched forward. I kept encouraging him. He kept looking at me, trying to make me understand. At last, I came to a planter. We were definitely out of sync. I wanted to go forward. Nick was trying to explain that my direction would run us right into the planter. I wasn't following where we needed to go. Once we sorted it all out, Nick took off again. I praised him highly. He had figured it out. Or at least, I wanted him to think so so that he would do that again.

Nick is very careful when crossing streets. Ice and snow and water are dangerous. He moves very slowly and stops a lot. More encouragement. He can do this. And when he does, more praise. We will sort all this out in time.

Nick was trained during the spring and summer so he has no training about winter traveling conditions.
