### December 20, 2016

The past two weekends, we have received a lot of snow, about 6 inches each weekend. In Milwaukee, where we visited last weekend, they had more.

Nick loves the snow. He runs and jumps, turning in midair. To avoid sharp jerks of my regular lead, I started using the Flexi lead. Even so, Nick races to its end and there is often a significant jerk. I have dropped the lead as a result, feeling it fly out of my hands.

It is a joy to experience Nick's running. On the down side, I have also fallen into the snow. With the amounof snow we have had, I often find it difficult to get up.

When we were visiting my son, Nick decided to visit the neighbor's yard. Fortunately my son came outside to find us.
