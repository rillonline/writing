## August 2, 2018

Today Nick and I celebrate our second anniversary.

Nick and I had a rocky start. I was originally matched with a different dog, Chance. Chance did everything I asked to do except go fast. I decided I didn't want to bring a dog home that would likely slow down and then I would be very frustrated. I asked for a new dog.

Chance left in the morning. I went to lunch dogless. At lunch I learned one of the other students had to leave class due to an injury. I even passed him as he was leaving.

In my room, my instructor brought my dog to me. I was in love immediately--a yellow Labrador Retriever male.

"Full disclosure," my instructor said. "This was Stanley's dog."

I have always felt badly that, in order to get Nick, Stanley had to get hurt. If only he had received Chance and I was initially paired with Nick.

I don't know what this was all about-- Do things happen for a reason? Well, I've always been glad Nick was not paired with a newby.
