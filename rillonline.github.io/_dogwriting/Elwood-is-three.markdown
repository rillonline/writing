### January 8, 2008 ###

Today Elwood is three. I can hardly believe it. He wasn't quite two
when I got him.

I can't say he has settled down any. In some ways, he seems wilder
now. I think this is because he thinks he can get away with more
things with me. We don't tell the dogs we can't see, but they figure
it out. Elwood's great transgression is sleeping on the day bed. It is
hard to catch him and even to scold him when he wags so happily at me.
"Hi! Here I am."

We don't have anything special planned. We did get a walk in today in
the mild weather. Elwood pulled very hard. He saw another dog. We must
have been following it. Elwood has finally decided he can pull a bit
in harness on a regular basis. He was so insecure all year about this
but has gotten much better.

Elwood's favorite trip is to go along the River Walk. He zooms right
to the path and takes off at a sharp pace. This is fine when there
isn't any ice. Last week we could not traverse the path because I slid
down the hill and tried to explain yet again to a dog that people do
not have 4-paw-drive.

Elwood likes to make a relief stop along the way. We had to develop a
rule: one stop per trip. He would keep going off the path to sniff and
I kept wondering if it was necessary. Now we have the one stop rule.
Elwood almost understands it.

Of course Elwood is still climbing on my lap and still carrying his
bone constantly. I would be very sad if he stopped either behavior. I
do wish he would learn not to climb in my lap when we are in public.
He is still quite insecure when he is laying on the floor. He
apparently thinks he has been forgotten and his ego can't take that
one little bit. He is not a big sleeper while I'm doing something of
interest to people. He still wants to be in the thick of things.
