Today Elwood was quite funny.

* When we got into the car to go to church, Elwood tried sitting on my lap. He 
Has done this more since he got his tail caught in the door. After I convinced 
him to get into the foot well, he positioned his nose under the dash and left his harness in my lap--opposite of what is usually done.

* During the sermon, Elwood fell asleep. Good. Well, not so good. He started 
dreaming. His feet were going. His whole body was shaking. He began yipping. He 
started barking and there wasn't any correction I could give him. He was asleep. I 
thought about waking him up, but that really didn't seem fair. The pastor said 
afterward: "Not only do I put people to sleep. Now I put dogs to sleep, too".

* Elwood has a rubbery toy called a cong. It's wider at the bottom than at the
 top with rings getting smaller and smaller. Both ends are open. Sometimes he 
carries it in his mouth. Tonight he began racing around, running up and down the 
hall. Whoever created the sounds in cartoons of animals running and then 
screeching to a stop knew a dog like Elwood. That's exactly what it sounds like. He 
also began making noises through the cong. It sounded like a hooting noise. I was 
laughing so hard I couldn't get his harness on. I had him give me the cong, put 
it on the bookcase, he took it back and the running and noisemaking started all 
over again. He knew I would just laugh. Finally I said to him, "We have to get 
serious," and we did.
