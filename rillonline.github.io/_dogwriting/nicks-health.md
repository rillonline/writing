### January 5, 2017

Today I took Nick to the vet. Yet again, Nick has ear infections in both ears. It is clear he has been scratching because the outside of his ears are all cut up.

Since November, we have been operating on the premise that Nick has an allergy which manifests itself in itchy skin and ear infections. Last Friday, he came to the end of his prescription. The only way to know if his hypo-allergenic food is sufficient to eliminate the itchiness and infection is to stop the medication. At yoga Tuesday night I discovered Nick licking his feet again--a sure sign of itchiness. I also noticed his ears are smelling more strongly, a clear indication of infection.

So Nick is back on meds and has an additionalone for managing the inflamation which can occur in his ears.

I am dealing with the reality that Nick's allergy cannot be cured and I will be administering these meds forever. The allergy is genetic. Allergies do not manifest themselves until the dog is between one and three years old.

I have two reactions:

1. I do not want to return Nick to the Seeing Eye as being unsuitable. Nick is a great guide and worker. He has been working while not feeling 100%.
2. I am very disturbed that I was given a dog with the potential of a very serious condition. The medication and prescription food is expensive. Thanks be to God, I can handle the financial hit. I do not want to give him any medication which could compromise his health which ingested steroids can.

I pray we have a clear path to Nick's health being at 100%.
