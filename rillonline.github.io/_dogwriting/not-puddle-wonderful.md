### February 11, 2017

Nick and I finally got out for a walk. The temp is above freezing. It is not windy. I am feeling better after being sidelined with my winter cold.

I put Nick's gentle leader on. He is so rambunctious after being cooped up for a such a long time he wants to run and run. I might be up to that but there are still icy places. Nick recognizes most of them, but the little pieces of ice don't catch his attention but I still slip on them.

We walked a little over a mile and encountered many puddles. Despite what e. e. cummings said in his poem "in just", the world out there is niether "puddle wonderful" nor "mud luscious". The puddles are deep and wide. Some have lumps of salt in them while the more dangerous ones have unsalted ice. No one was out with shovels to clean them up. Our most unfavorite stretch along N. High Point was still mostly ice though someone had made a half-hearted effort to throw some salt around, an improvement from previous winters. We even found a pothole in one of the courts.

Nick did very well though he protests about wearing the gentle leader. I will keep using it until the sidewalks dry out and the protest diminish.

We even had a church friend hail us from her car and wave us across the street.
