### Date: January 8, 2013

Today I'm writing about my dogs as friends. They are referred to as service dogs who carry with them stringent warnings against fraternization as if they were Buckingham Palace guards or Secret Service agents. Since I can still go to pieces talking about Caitlin,my first dog, I'll describe it as friendship so deep the dog becomes a part of me. Of course this friendship can only operate on the dog's level. We do not have deep discussions. We simply try to understand each other as we are able.

One of the central qualities of a dog guide is his or her ability to learn and execute routes. I cannot say to my dog, "Let's go to the library," but I can navigate to the general area of the library by giving Elwood left, right and forward commands which he executes faithfully. I can then suggest we go inside. I will be brought to the library door. If we walk past the library on another errand, Elwood will often suggest we go inside by turning onto the ramp or stepping up the first step onto the raised apron entryway.

These dogs are reliable, stopping at curbs, turning left and right on command, selecting the safest part of the sidewalk to walk on, and avoiding obstacles.

Since the blizzard which left us with 19.5 inches of snow, the qualities of trust and forgiveness have come to my attention once again.

I trained with Caitlin in January, 1994. It was the Winter of fourteen Snowstorms in New Jersey and Philadelphia where I lived at the time. They still talk about this class at [The Seeing Eye](http://seeingeye.org/). Getting all our training outdoors completed challenged everyone.

Caitlin showed me she could navigate the Philadelphia campus of my school even when the walks were snow-covered. We set off to the Refectory. We arrived there even though no part of the sidewalk was cleared. I thought this ability just came with the dog. I took it for granted and did not value this quality in her highly enough.

I trained with Elwood at the end of November and into December during a very mild winter in 2006. No boots, scarves, gloves. I did not even bring my heavy winter coat though I did tuck a Polartek vest, hat, scarf and gloves in my suitcase.

Elwood's training arc was all in mild weather. The first time it snowed in Jamestown, New York where we lived, he was shocked to think I wanted to go anywhere on snow-covered sidewalks. Without a familiar band of concrete before him, he was uncertain how to proceed. Fortunately, I knew the area well and could encourage him step by step to achieve our destination and return home again safely. Elwood needed to trust me and he did.

When I lived in Plainsboro, New Jersey Caitlin and I walked nearly a mile to the grocery store almost daily to feed a family of three. Part of our route crossed a field on the old road bed. After a snowstorm, the macadam might be transversed but no one could call it cleared. There was a large sheet of ice. I fell down. Caitlin just stood there, looking down at me. I interpreted this stance as "What happened? What are you doing down there?" She waited patiently while I got up.

I fell several more times before she understood I did not possess four-paw drive. Every winter we repeated this scene in order for her to exercise caution for my sake, but once she got it, she proceeded with great care and concern for my well-being.

Over New Year's weekend, I decided it would be good for both Elwood and me to take a walk. Surely the sidewalk along High Point Road would be clear by now. Not so. We agreed to persevere. We share the fun of a walk with no errand to run.

Elwood has demonstrated his ability to travel over snow-covered sidewalks this year. He suggested we turn at an intersection. At first I overrode him, but the access to the street seemed unfamiliar to me so I agreed we would make the turn. A while later, we ran out of sidewalk. I imagined we were on Parmenter Street. I gave instructions accordingly. We walked in the street for a bit and then went out of the street, but not forward. We were in someone's driveway with no sidewalk leading further down the street.

Hmmm. The sidewalk was clear ten days ago and we had not had that much additional snow. Time to check GPS on the smart phone. We were on one of the side streets. We started making our way back to High Point Road.

that's when things started falling apart for us. I stopped trusting Elwood though he gave me no cause. I began micro-managing our walk, Elwood opted to reflect my lack of trust by becoming untrustworthy, finding the street fascinating. He sniffed here. He sniffed there. I kept insisting he focus and listened to directions from Google maps. When it said to turn, I told Elwood to turn. Elwood agreed, being far more forgiving than I am, to do as I said and we ended up at someone's house. We walked up a lot of driveways and Elwood found the steps to many front doors, doing his job willingly without any disparaging comments or reluctance.

We turned around and walked a bit farther over and over again, the sound of the beltline coming closer and closer. I became anxious, fearful we would walk out onto High Point Road.

This was a possibility as far as I was concerned. Our first winter in Madison when we lived on the south side, Elwood decided walking down South Park Street which was clear of snow was preferable to walking down poorly shoveled sidewalks. Clearly open roadway was better footing than lumpy and narrow pathways through the snow. Always concerned for my well-being, he reasoned this was the safer option.

When we did make our turn, I checked very carefully that we had piles of snow on each side of us.

The bottom line: Elwood guided me across sidewalks and streets that are still almost not discernible. He happily turned in at our parking lot when I asked him to even when he would have enjoyed a longer outing.

Elwood received much praise when we came into the house though I confess  I should have trusted him more. Forgiving me is a quality Elwood demonstrates every day.
