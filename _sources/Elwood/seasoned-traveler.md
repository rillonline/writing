--- We've had a busy time of it. Elwood and I left at 4:30 a.m. for
the airport to go to my son's wedding. The flights themselves were
uneventful. The ground processing was slow and frustrating. We learned
it's a half an hour walk from Terminal C to Terminal A in Detroit.

Elwood was terrific at the wedding and the reception. Lots of people
didn't even know a dog was present. That's an important test for me
... Does my dog know when it's important to behave?

Elwood learned the hotel pretty well ... where the elevator was, how
to go in and out and how to get to the restaurant. He really preferred
to show me the stairs, but they were in his direct line of sight while
the elevator was at an angle.

Fast food restaurants continue to be problematic--too much food on the
floor and too much activity. Elwood is very definitely a pack animal.
If anyone around him is up, he believes he should be up.

Today a friend sewed both his mats since he is thinking they might be
fun to chew on. He has bones. He has other toys all of which have good
chew value.

Today I caught his tail in the car door. I'm not proud of this. Elwood
shrieks quite effectively. afterward, he stayed in my lap.

I finally convinced him otherwise. He certainly
is quite dramatic and milks his advantage for all its worth.
