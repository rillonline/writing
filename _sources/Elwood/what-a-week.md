# What A Week! #

Elwood, apparently, has not previously had exposure to church. Having
gone Saturday night, he was able to survive the Cantata at the
Methodist church. He did jump up periodically when everyone else did
and when there was applause.

We are learning other people's cars. I have asked my friends to
remember what worked.

Then there was Wednesday night and Thursday morning ... Elwood found a
traditional Vespers service with chanting and candlelight more than he
could take. He wriggled out of his harness and climbed on the pew and
me. Holding him with one hand, I unbuckled the harness and got it back
on him to settle him back down again. My pewmate said: "I figured out
you didn't want a lighted candle to hold."

We had practiced resting in the pew alone every day. What I hadn't
planned on Thursday morning was that everyone gets up. Elwood got up,
too. I ended up with the flixileash wrapped around Elwood, the pew and
myself. More practice needed.

We have a new place at the table for doughnuts afterward. We have to sit
far away from the person who comes with dog biscuits in his pocket and
who cannot restrain himself. Children are always better. They know about
rules.

Bible study was also a trial. The children had been in the room with
cookies the night before.

Park is going better.

Elwood prefers the elevator to the stairs.

Today we took a walk, down 2nd Street, up Prindergast, across on 5th and
back down Main. After doing all this walking, Elwood suddenly made a
turn. He had found St. Luke's. He was convinced that was where we were
going. It took a lot of persuading, after a lot of praise, to convince
him to pass it up.

We have elected to go to the late service Christmas Eve. I didn't think
either of us could manage the early one with the pageant. I'm vesting
and reading. Elwood's first time at the lectern. It's not hard--I
hope.

I may finally have gotten the reading sitation changed. It is always
announced as Isaiah 35 but it is actually Isaiah 9.

Well, we have some work to do and our final park of the evening.
