Chapter 8: Some Notes From the Author
-------------------------------------


.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

                 Diary entries should go here. Ronnie writes about her
		 desire for Suri Iglesia and her conflicted feelings
		 toward Captain Star Runner. If only Captain Star
		 Runner would protest, Ronnie would be able to resist
		 Suri Iglesia's appeal. However, Ronnie knows it is
		 not possible for Star Runner to make such a strong
		 personal declaration. Knowing this is not sufficient
		 for Ronnie. She needs Star Runner to do something.

.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

                 I am writing way too many notes to self and not
		 enough writing. I am hopeful that these notes spark
		 the writing of the tale, the parts that have energy.
		 Recently I heard a talk where someone mentioned that
		 all relationships have three parts:

                   1. Good.  
                   2. Rut.  
                   3. Transition.

                 For Star Runner and Ronnie, they have good periods.
                 Then they fall into a rut. Then they are vulnerable
                 to a transition which for them usually means breaking
                 apart. Once apart, they get back together and it is
                 good again. At some point they need to recognize
                 their pattern and find a way to transition out of
                 their get together, fall into a rut, break apart
                 pattern. Perhaps this is the book. Then again, there
                 are story arc possibilities if they break up because
                 they can get back together again. I do not foresee
                 them breaking up so completely that they never get
                 back again. Sometimes I think it is my failing as the
                 author that I cannot keep them together happily. But
                 also as the author, I think it is their nature to not
                 maintain their relationship. Star Runner's
                 relationships with other characters are subject to
                 this same back and forth, but because Star Runner is
                 not always with them the breakup is dictated by time
                 and distance rather than affection and trust. Star
                 Runner and Ronnie have a lot of problems with trust.
                 Affection is not one of their problems. Trust is a
                 major issue in their lives and between them. This
                 adventure finally demonstrates this to me. I have
                 been groping for several years now. Now I get it.
