Novel Scenes
============

Act I
-----

-  Stage One: The Ordinary World

   #. Ronnie is in the classroom where everyone is receiving their
      assignment. Ronnie is a human female. All the other participants
      are Tigerfu. When it comes to Ronnie's turn, she is simply told
      to report to the Director's Office. The instructor does not know
      any more than this. Ronnie is upset. What could she have done
      wrong? She had completed all her assignments successfully. In
      fact, she is in the top three to five in the class. Her only
      shortcomings are her unfamiliarity with all the nuances of
      Tigerfu culture and its history. Or is it that the Tigerfu do
      not want a human involved in their war crime investigations? The
      Tigerfu think of themselves as being a very moral people. 
      Everyone stares after Ronnie as she leaves. 
   #. Ronnie goes to the director's office to receive her assignment.
      Ronnie is given no information, just that someone named Grand
      Master Awk, Emeritus, will be her new team leader. She is to meet with
      him immediately. The director cannot tell her any more. The
      director is in a hurry to dismiss her. Master Awk's operation is
      top secret. The Director does not have the clearance to discuss
      it with Ronnie. Ronnie
      has more of a bad feeling about this. What is going on? How can
      she have a higher security clearance than the Director of the
      War Crimes Tribunal?

-  Stage Two: The Call to Adventure

   3. Ronnie meets Grand Master Awk, Emeritus for the first time. He
      explains that he is a wizzard and she is to be his new
      apprentice. Ronnie storms from the room. Is this a joke?

-  Stage Three: Refusal of the Call

   4. Ronnie going about the school--the director's office, the
      instructors' offices, meeting up with her classmates,, returning
      to her room. No one will see her. Her classmates turn away. She
      thought these Tigerfu were her friends. At her room, she learns
      she needs to vacate quickly. The next class is coming in and
      will need it. With no alternative, Ronnie returns to Grand Master Awk.

-  Stage Four: Meeting with the Mentor

   5. Ronnie returns to Grand Master Awk. She is not well-pleased, but
      she seems to have no viable alternative at this point. Her
      assessment of Grand MAster Awk is that he is very old and
      confused. He must have been an impressive Tigerfu once, but age
      and dementia is robbing him of his faculties. 

Act II
------

-  Stage Five: Crossing the First Threshold

   6.  Ronnie packing and brooding. She goes over in her mind what she
       has learned from Grand Master Awk. There is a lot to be
       learned. She feels very alone and wishes for her friends from
       Ptolemy City, especially Captain Star Runner. We learn a bit
       about Ronnie's back story here.

   #.  Ronnie goes aboard the spacecraft. It is clear from the scene at
       the spaceport that their craft is located far from the regular
       commercial traffic. The ship is old and utilitarian. This is not
       a luxury flight. Instead, it is a small freighter. Ronnie and
       Grand Master Awk are the only passengers. The crew is minimal.
       Ronnie finds the ship very claustrophobic. The confinement aboard
       ship amplifies her fear of going to The Magic Lands. This turn of
       events seems far from her aspiration to be a war crimes
       investigator.

   #.  Master Awk instructs Ronnie. Grand Master Awk explains to
       Ronnie that some people have an aptitude for magic. Her profile
       says she does. In The MAgic Lands, magic works and those who
       practice it belong to an organization which oversees their
       training and their work. Practicing magic outside of this
       organization's oversight is illegal. He tells Ronnie that by
       convention practitioners are called wizzards and they call what
       they do magic. Sorcerers, on the other hand, are people who
       practice sorcery outside of the guild's oversight. It's just
       words, Master Awk stresses, but it might be helpful for Ronnie
       to understand. Her training will be to be able to use her gift
       and to study. Can she read Tigerfu? Can she read ancient
       Tigerfu? When Ronnie says she has a functional literacy with
       modern Tigerfu but no understanding of ancient Tigerfu or
       Tigerfu script, GRand Master Awk is disappoiinted. She will
       have to learn both to study the ancient lore. The books cannot
       be digitized. Part of the instruction is learning how to read a
       magical book, and the books themselves are magical. All this
       talk of magic makes Ronnie's head hurt. She is convinced this
       is an elaborate hoax but she doesn't understand what it is
       covering up..  The captain takes Ronnie aside.

   10. Arriving in The Magic Lands. The disembarkation point looks
       ancient, made out of stone with narrow corridors and low
       ceilings. After passing through this area, they enter Magic City
       which looks like a fairy city with lots of spires. Although the
       disembarkation area looked European medieval, this looks more
       Victorian.
   11. Grand Master Awk takes Ronnie to meet the current Grand Master,
       Vesha. She reminds Ronnie of a witch with a pointed nose and
       chin. All she needs, Ronnie thinks, is a hat and a broomstick.
       Grand Master Vesha asks Ronnie a few questions, but Ronnie thinks
       these are perfunctory. What the grand master is doing is taking
       Ronnie's measure. Afterwards, Ronnie is asked to leave so the two
       elderly grand masters can speak together.
   12. Crossing to the Musical Mountains.Ronnie and Grand Master Awk
       board an open vehicle that floats over the countryside low enough
       so that they can see if and even inteeract with its inhabitants.
       There are villages and market towns--lots of farms and animals.
       Everything looks quite low tech. Ronnie wonders how advanced the
       culture is. Grand Master Awk explains that the people of this
       planet have chosen this style of living and much of their lives
       are made easier by magic. Ronnie, looking at Tigerfu faces and
       body language is not sure Grand Master Awk is telling her the
       truth. Life appears to be very hard and many people she sees look
       unfed or ill or both. Medical care seems lacking as she sees
       people with untended injuries. She would like to stop and speak
       with them but there is little opportunity as their hovercraft
       continues its glide.

-  Stage Six: Allies, Tests Enemies

   13. In the River City. The hovercraft finally stops at a city. Grand
       Master Awk and Ronnie disembark and make their way to a small
       hotel. There Ronnie meets Senior Master Gaunt and his Apprentice
       Tripp. They will be joining Ronnie and Grand Master Awk on their
       journey to the Musical Mountains. Ronnie learns Senior Master
       Gaunt and Apprentice Tripp have already been working there but
       came to meet Grand Master Awk and her in this city to escort them
       to the Musical Mountains. Ronnie wonders why an escort is
       necessary. Apprentice Tripp tells Ronnie Senior Master Gaunt
       wants to talk with Grand Master Awk before they get there. This
       gives the apprentices a time to get to know each other.

   14.River Walk. Ronnie and Tripp decide to go out for the evening.
       They go down to the riverside. Amid the lights and music,
       Ronnie learns about the deprivation of the people and the
       great disparity between the haves and the have nots. Ronnie
       asks Tripp is she is from this planet. Tripp says no. She and
       Senior Master Gaunt are from another planet in The Magic
       Lands which is very agricultural and very modern. Both
       apprentices are puzzled by the state of this planet.

   15.The fracas. Ronnie and Tripp are challenged by some locals
       because they are dressed in apprentice attire. The women are
       uncertain how to respond since they thought their position as
       apprentices would be respected, this being a planet in The
       Magic Lands. Apparently not. Ronnie prepares for a fight and
       is assessing how best to handle her attackers when Senior
       Master Gaunt shows up and rescues them. Tripp summoned him.
       Ronnie is annoyed rather than relieved. She is accustomed to
       taking care of herself. The women are scolded by Senior
       Master Gaunt for associating with the locals. Tripp accepts
       this scolding but Ronnie is outraged. She complains to Grand
       MAster Awk who does not give her an explanation which
       outrages her even more. In the morning, they resume their
       journey aboard a different hovercraft.

   16. The wizzards teach the apprentices how to change the shape of
       the clouds. Ronnie thinks of it like making balloon animals.

   17. Arrival at the Musical Mountains. The mountains are breathtaking,
       complete with snowy peaks and clouds. They do make music.
       Most notably, along with rocky crags, waterfalls, rivers,
       gorges, mountain meadows, forests and such, the mountains
       have large areas which are made of glass. These sparkle and
       there are rainbows in prisms. The wizzards and their
       apprentices disembark and travel into cave-like structures,
       deep inside the mountain. Although some corridors are
       completely enclosed, many go through glass and are brightly
       lit. The enclosed, dark corridors makes Ronnie nervous. Being
       enclosed is not the problem for her.. Not having a sky is.
       The enclosed spaces make her think of spaceships and space
       stations. She is not fond of either. With much giving of
       passwords and bio scans, they are finally at the Project.

   18. Grand Master Awk presents Ronnie to Most Senior Master Roop. Roop
       is the wizzard in charge of the project. He must accept Grand
       Master Awk because of his status. Roop does not have to accept
       Ronnie. The interview is frought with tention. Roop is the final
       threshold guardian. Ronnie wonders what will happen to the plan
       for her to investigate if Roop rejects her. Roop, for his part,
       is terrified by Grand Master Awk's arrival. He is uncertain how
       much magic the old Tigerfu can still perform. There have been
       rumors of Grand MAster Awk's forgetfulness and failing abilities.
       However, he can probably still teach. Ronnie is an unknown
       quantity and she is an alien. Roop is suspicious, but he cannot
       show his suspicion. The project is in trouble and perhaps Grand
       Master Awk can be pursuaded to actually help. Ronnie may be his
       way to avoid suspicion. Roop immediately sees how observant she
       is. He wonders if she is a spy. But perhaps, with a judicious use
       of magic and charm, he can turn her to his advantage. Roop does
       not know Ronnie is a Lesbian. Tripp does. Ronnie's sudden
       interest in Roop will first puzzle Tripp and then suggest to
       Tripp that something is wrong. Ronnie will not heed Tripp's
       warnings until it is too late.

-  Stage Seven: Approach to the Inmost Cave

19. Ronnie figures out that Roop is using the Transfer Controller to
    send messages to The People of the Rainbow Sky. This is the same
    magically controlled machine that Grand Master Awk is trying to
    debug.
    
-  Stage Eight: Ordeal

      20. Ronnie is outraged and she can hardly believe Roop is a
	  traitor. She goes to find Roop to confront him. She finds
	  him with the Transfer Controller, feeding it data for The
	  People of the Rainbow Sky. Ronnie knows this because she can
	  recognize coordinants. She has not contacted Master Awk, but
	  Master Awk has asked Tripp where Ronnie is and she has told
	  him. Ronnie uses magic to try to stop Roop's transmission.
	  As inexperienced as she is, her own talent disrupts Roop's
	  spell. The Transfer Controller, which has been built with an
	  error in it, seizes up and sends out of magical wave. It
	  kills Roop and Master Awk while injuring Ronnie. She is
	  knocked unconscious. It has to be a magical wave because an
	  explosion in the caves will bring the mountains down on top
	  of everyone. Alarms sound. Master Gaunt and Tripp rush in.
	  As the scene ends, no one knows if Ronnie has survived.

-  Stage Nine: reward (seizing the sword)

   Ronnie awakens to discover she is in Magic City. She feels
   strange and is in pain. Grand Mistress Vesha comes in and brings
   her up-to-date. Grand Master Awk and Roop are dead. being debriefed. Senior Master Gaunt is now in charge of the
   project. Because Ronnie's magic undid all the magic in the
   project, the transformation of material to energy and the
   transfer of material and energy to the Green Belt has stopped.
   This is very troublesome. Fortunately, the Green Belt has a
   small stockpile and will limp along for a while. It makes them
   very vulnerable to The People of the Rainbow Sky. Tigerfu
   Intelligence thinks it is passing along false intelligence from
   Roop's AI, but they do not know how long they will be able to
   maintain the charade. Ronnie is under arrest for performing
   magic she is not authorized to perform, for the deaths of Master
   Awk and Roop. Senior Master Gaunt is rebuilding the spells for
   the project. Master Awk was able to identify the place in the
   spell chain where things went aw awry. He suspects Roop
   introduced the error but he cannot be sure. Rebuilding the
   project is going quickly and he hopes to get the transfer back
   online soon. Graqnd Mistress Vesha questions Ronnie closely and
   Ronnie realizes she is feeling different underneath her
   disorientation and pain. Grand Mistress Vesha tells her she has
   been changed by the magic itself. This happens to practitioners
   and it is something they look forward to. Unfortunately, this
   has happened to Ronnie prematurely. Grand Mistress Vesha will
   take over as her instructor which means Ronnie will be in a
   dampening field to cancel out her ability to perform magic. A tribunal will be held when Ronnie
   is a bit better to decide what to do with Ronnie. Ronnie asks to
   see Tripp but Vesha refuses.

   After Vesha leaves, Ronnie reflects on what she has learned, on her
   relationships with Master Awk and Roop and sends a message to
   Apprentice Tripp.

Novel Summary
=============

The War of Consolidation continues. Documenting the war crimes of the
People of the Rainbow Sky is an important part of the Tigerfu offense in
the ongoing war among several races within the eastern arm of the
galaxy. Detective Ronnie Camberwell, currently living among the Tigerfu,
is anxious to help the Tigerfu because the People of the Rainbow Sky
manipulated her friend and some time lover Captain Star Runner with near
fatal results.

Ronnie has just completed the introductory course so that she might join
the War Crimes Investigation Unit. Without any explanation, she is informed she will not
receive an assignment in The War Crimes Investigation Unit. Instead, she
is to meet with her new team leader immediately.

Ronnie is upset. What could she have done wrong? She had completed all
her assignments successfully. In fact, she is in the top three to five
in the class. Her only shortcomings are her unfamiliarity with all the
nuances of Tigerfu culture and its history. Or is it that the Tigerfu do
not want a human involved in their war crime investigations? The Tigerfu
think of themselves as being a very moral people.

Ronnie enters a room where a very elderly Tigerfu stands. He leans on an
ornate staff. Ronnie still does not know a lot about Tigerfu culture,
but she does know a staff like this one connotes wisdom and a position
of respect.

The elderly man addresses her as "Apprentice' and identifies himself as
"Master Awk". He tells her she has been assigned to him and they are
going to the Magic Lands. They are a team of two.

Ronnie storms from the room, convinced there has been a huge mistake.
However, the Director is gone for the day. Her instructors tell her they
cannot help her, that the director's decision is final. When she returns
to her room, she learns she must remove her possessions by midday and
she will have no access to the room after that time. She has no other
option but to return to the room where she left Master Awk. He is still
waiting for her. Reluctantly, she agrees to join his team. It annoys her
that everyone else already knew she had no other options. She declines
invitations by her classmates to accompany them them for a final
celebratory meal and spends the evening packing. Their spaceship leaves
in the wee hours of the morning. Without a good-bye to anyone, Ronnie
leaves the school.

on their space journey to The Magic Lands, Master Awk advises Ronnie
that magic is real in discrete parts of the galaxy. The Magic Lands are
a part of Tigerfu Land. She has been reassigned because she both has an
aptitude for magic (hence her apprentice status) and investigation
skills that will determine if a spy is leaking information to the People
of the Rainbow Sky concerning a very important project. The Grand Master
requested Master Awk's help. Both wizzards understand the magic but do
not know how to investigate the traitor. The wizzards are creating a
great shift in mass and the expenditure of energy is huge. They are
supporting a a region of space the People of the Rainbow Sky devastated.
Master Awk and Ronnie will become a part of the project. In addition,
the project has run into a snag. It is expending wizzard energy to a
debilitating degree. Master Awk has been called in to find out why.
Ronnie needs to be a real apprentice for their cover to be effective.

Although Ronnie is upset that she was not consulted in her change of
status to Wizzard Apprentice and her assignment to The Magic Lands, she
is excited to be part of an important investigation.

The captain of the spaceship waylays Ronnie and advises her not to go to
The Magic Lands. He says he is afraid even to bring his spacecraft out
of hyperspace there, but orders are orders. Ronnie asks him why. He says
that people who go into The Magi c Lands never return again.

Master Awk says Ronnie must always remember the three laws of magic if
she is to survive this mission:

#. Respect the free will of others.
#. There is always a cost to the wizzard for doing magic.
#. The wizzard is responsible for consequences of all the magic he or
   she performs.

Master Awk provides the axiom "It is far easier to perform magic than to
unperform it later." This saying will come back to haunt Ronnie later.

The project has the wizzards design spells to break down moons and
asteroids so that they are converted into both material and energy which
is then transported via hyperspace to the devastated region of space
known as The Green Belt. When the infrastructure is rebuilt, spacecraft
can bring the needed seeds and plants so that this area can re-establish
itself as the best source of fruits and vegetables in the eastern arm.
Through a series of investigations, Ronnie learns The project leader is
being paid for intelligence about the project by the People of the
Rainbow Sky. His bounty is increased if he can also disrupt the
project.The scheme Roop puts in in place denudes their region of space
of valuable material resources

If the project continues on this path, all the wizzards connected with
it are, in effect, will die slowly as their life energy is drained away
from them. The People of the Rainbow Sky are playing on Roop's averous
and greed for power and his antipathy toward the Grand Master who has
criticized Roop's handling of projects before. Roop's heir hurry to
complete the task has caused the problems Master Awk was summoned to
correct.

When Master Awk receives Ronnie's report, he is appalled. He plans to
take his finds to the Grand Master of Wizzards for plan how to arrest
Roop and get the project back on track..

Along the way, Ronnie becomes enamored with the leader of the project,
Roop. She is confused by her attraction.This is the first man Ronnie has
ever been attracted to. To make the spells work faster, the project is
infusing them with their own life energy. Ronnie sees the ill-effects
this is having on Roop and she wants to save him.

In a confrontation with Roop, he reveals he knows about her
investigations and Master Awk's plan to turn him and his partner
wizzards into the Tribunal. Panicked that her own life is now at stake
and that Roop's health is so precarious, Ronnie uses her own magic to
disrupt the process. Roop and several of the other wizzards die because
their lives are so entwined with the transfer spells that disrupting
them disrupts their lives.

Ronnie is arrested by the Tribunal for murder and for not consulting her
master wizzard before acting. She is, after all, only an apprentice.
Her spell did not take into account all the needed safeguards. That is
why the wizzards died.

A tribunal of wizzards is called. Ronnie is placed on trial. The three
laws of magic are applied to her situation. The tribunal states Ronnie
has the potential to be an incredibly skillful wizzard. Because her
gifts will be needed for the Magic Lands to complete their work, she is
assigned to the energy project under the supervision of a local wizzard
until such time as the Tribunal believes she has paid her debt. Ronnie's
personal freedoms are greatly restricted including her freedom to
travel. She may not leave the Magic Lands and she may not associate with
anyone until her master aproves. Ronnie is, in effect, under house
arrest at the project. .

As the story ends, Master Awk bids her farewell and terminates her
connection to the Tigerfu military. She is given a dishonorable
discharge pending the completion of her sentence in the Magic Lands.

Questions for Lesson 1
======================
1. What is the issue, the human problem being studied, solved, or
   celebrated? The issue being studied in this novel is: With great
   power comes great responsibility.
2. Have you introduced your main character? Who is he/she? Detective Ronnie Camberwell is the central character. She is a
   capable investigator who finds herself the only human in an alien
   culture very far from home.
3. Do you set up your central question and does that
   central question set up the crises and climax? Yes.
4. Do you have subplots? No.
5. How will you use your archetypes to achieve your dramatic function?

   -  I will use Detective Ronnie Camberwell to be my flawed heroine.
      She will come to acknowledge her wizard powers.
   -  I will use the Director of the War Crimes Investigation School
      as my herald. He tells Ronnie she has been assigned to Grand Master Awke's team.
   -  Grand Master Awke, Emeritus will be Ronnie's mentor. He will try
      to instill in her responsible wizardry. Only after his
      accidental death
      will Ronnie come to appreciate his teaching, mourn his loss and
      begin to come to terms with her power.
   -  Tripp will be Ronnie's ally.
   -  Senior Master Gaunt, Tripp's mentor, will be a kind of
      shift shaper though there is nothing cynister in this. He  takes on the roles of
      threshold guardian and later ally at the Tribunal.Ronnie is
      quick to identify him as a potential Villon. Gaunt will argue
      Awke did not impress on Ronnie her potential for doing harm. His
      view will forcefully persuade the other wizards at the Tribunal.
   -  Grand Mistress Vesha is a threshold guardian whose responsibility it is to ensure proper oversight of all wizards and that wizard
      status is not given to anyone undeserving. She will become
      Ronnie's mentor after Grand Master Awke's death. Her remarks to
      Ronnie on power and responsibility will sting.
   -  The spaceship captain is a threshold guardian. He will try to
      dissuade Ronnie from entering The Magic Lands. He says once
      Ronnie goes there, she will not be able to return. He turns out
      to be right, at least in the short term. 

#. We all have a set of talents. We often characterize these as
   God-given. We have no control over them. For Ronnie, one of these
   latent talents is the ability to perform magic. Circumstances find
   Ronnie involved with an alien culture which is involved in a space
   war between ancient combatents. With no family or friends nearby, she
   must find her way in these alien worlds. This makes her vulnerable to
   error and to transgressing local mores.

   Ronnie's story is compared and contrasted with that of the dedication
   of the wizzards of the Magic Lands to help others devastated by the
   space war.

#. Roop has cast a spell on Ronnie to make her attracted to him while
   her natural attraction is to women. He has done this for his own
   ends. He does not want her to question anything he does and he wants
   her to do everything he asks. Roop is secretly sending intelligence
   to The People of the Rainbow Sky about the project. He hopes for an
   opportunity to leave the Magic Lands and he believes the People of
   the Rainbow Sky will give him that opportunity. Roop, for his part,
   is beholden to the Most Master Wizzard for an earlier transgression.
   After Roop's death, the power of the spell on Ronnie dissipates and
   she is able to reconstruct Roop's crime for the Tribunal. This allows
   them to set a time limit on her sentence. Otherwise, it would be for
   life.

Characters and Their Archetypes
===============================

-  Ronnie: Ronnie is the hero though she does not do the right thing in
   the end.

-  Master Awk is Ronnie's mentor. He fails in the end because he gets
   swept up with the importance of the project. Ferreting out the spy,
   his mandate, is deprecated to the magic itself. Master Awk has spent
   too much time away from places where magic works.

-  The herald in this story is represented by several characters and
   situations. The Grand Master reaches out to Master Awk; the Tigerfu
   testing identifies Ronnie's aptitude for magic; Ronnie investigatory
   experience recommends her; The head of the War Crimes Unit reassigns
   Ronnie to Master Awk.

-  Senior Master Gaunt (and he is) is skeptical of Ronnie's usefulness
   to the project and will block and come upon Ronnie unexpectedly
   during Ronnie's investigations. Ronnie suspects Gaunt of misdoing. In
   fact, Gaunt is doing his own investigations because he thinks
   something is wrong but he can't prove it.

-  Tripp is a young wizzard, just finished her apprenticeship. She is
   attracted to Ronnie, gives her practical advice and shares living
   quarters with Ronnie. If Ronnie was not under Roop's spell, she would
   be mutually attracted to Tripp.

-  Tripp and Gaunt also function as allies. They encourage Ronnie in her
   magic learning and provide Ronnie with important information in her
   investigations.eir testimony help to mitigate Ronnie's sentence.

-  The People of the Rainbow Sky are the villains of the piece. Roop is
   a pawn in their plan of consolidation.

-  Roop is the shape-shifter. He is a very talented wizzard has led his
   failings rule his life.

-  

   The spaceship captain is a threshold guardian, trying to keep from
       taking Grand Master Awk and Ronnie to The Magic Lands and warning
       Ronnie about them during the trip through hyperspace.

-  Captain Star Runner does not physically appear in this story. Star
   Runner is an fuchsia-colored UN gendered Pantheran who pilots
   spaceships. Star functions as an ally and mentor in Ronnie's mind.

Questions for Lesson 2
======================

#. Ronnie's external problem as she begins her journey is the War of
   Consolidation. Once a mighty empire, the People of the Rainbow Sky
   turned their attention inward and their conquests gained
   independence. Now The People of the Rain Sky are mercilessly
   reconquering territory.

   Ronnie's internal problem is that she is leaving behind the War
   Crimes Training Program which would have been a form of detective
   work she understands with physical evidence and a crime scene. She
   has been unilaterally reassigned to apprentice as a magician which is
   hard to swallow. She has never considered magic to be real.

#. Ronnie is human. Her ordinary world consists of humans going about
   their every day tasks. Gradually, she has been introduced to aliens,
   especially Captain Star Runner, a Pantheran and an independent
   trader. Working with the Pantheran, Ronnie ended up living among the
   Tigerfu. Making her own way, she enrolled in the War Crimes
   Investigation branch of the Tigerfu military.

#. We see Ronnie in the ordinary world of the War Crimes Investigation
   School and aboard the spaceship with Master Awk on her way to The
   Magic Lands.

#. Ronnie's fantasy is the perfect lover who is always there for her,
   who is strong, kind, always understanding, sexually available and and
   attractive.. Ronnie herself is unable to commit herself to a
   monogamous relationship. She has had one human relationship fail
   because of her lack of commitment and her unwillingness to set aside
   all other relationships. Her relationship with Captain Star Runner is
   on again, off again. It does not survive long separations. She is
   jealous of any relationship Captain Star Runner has with anyone else.

   Ronnie craves her privacy in her personal affairs and total
   independence in her professional Although she would not admit it,
   Ronnie believes she is never good enough in her personal and
   professional lives. She is deeply wounded by the knowledge that she
   is not Troy Camberwell's daughter and does not know how to accept his
   generosity of continuing to be her father after the infidelity of her
   mother came to light. She knows she has disappointed Simon and Hilda
   Parge who provided a home for her while her father ran the police
   department in Ptolemy City. They disapproved of her relationship with
   Captain Star Runner and her ultimate decision to move away.

#. Ronnie's downfall will be believing that Roop loves her. She will try
   to save him from the diliterious effects of the project by acting
   alone to shut down the project.

#. Ronnie's universal human need is unconditional love.

#. Ronnie will believe Roop's attention toward her is real love. She
   will ignore Tripp's advances.

#. Ronnie's call to adventure originates with the Grand Master, but is
   delivered in two parts: by the Director of the War Crimes
   Investigations Branch and by Master Awk.

Questions for Lesson 3
======================

Refusing the Call
-----------------

#. What are your characters afraid of? What are false fears or paranoia?
   What are real fears?

   -  Apprentice Tripp

      -  failing to learn magic
      -  always being homesick
      -  being alone

      These are all real fears.

   -  Grand Master Awk, Emeritus

          -  His magic skills are not up to snuff. This includes both
             not

          being up-to-date with magic theory and practice as well as
          forgetfulness.

              -  letting down The Grand Master
              -  being unable to train an alien apprentice
              -  He will be unable to figure out what is going wrong at
                 the project.
              -  The People of the Rainbow Sky are involved.
              -  old jealousies. Are jealousies real or imagined?

   -  Master Gaunt

      -  Losing Apprentice Tripp's devotion to him as she becomes more
         and more besotted with Apprentice Ronnie
      -  his position at the project when Master Awk comes on board.
      -  the war, The People of the Rainbow Sky, in short, anyone and
         anything that will change his current position.

      All these fears are about to spill over into paranoia and threaten
      his basic willingness to be kind, to respect others, including
      aliens and to be as helpful as possible to those learning the
      craft.

   -  Senior Master Roop

   -  Ronnie

      -  Being the only human in a place where she has no Tigerfu
         friends.
      -  BEING caught investigating.
      -  Dying.
      -  Not being able to leave The Magic Lands.
      -  Not being able to see her friends ever again.
      -  Being caught by The People of the Rainbow Sky or their allies.

   -  The Grand Master

      Having The Project fail on her watch.

      -  Old scores being settled.
      -  Losing the Grand Master position.
      -  Losing face.

   -  The Spaceship Captain

          -  Being unable to leave The Magic Lands under his own power.
          -  Having magic practiced on his ship while in transit. (This
             is

          impossible since magic can only be practiced inside The Magic
          Lands. While in port, courtesy prohibits the practice of magic
          on or in close proximity to his ship. Nevertheless, the
          captain is afraid.) - Being attacked by The People of the
          Rainbow Sky or their allies.

   -  Being hit by friendly fire.

   -  What are the consequences of the refusal?

#. If you refused Calls to Adventure how would your life be different?

   I think it is impossible to refuse all calls to adventure. We are
   born. We go to school. We make friends. We Have romances and maybe
   marriages, we have children, have jobs, move to new places; we get
   sick and all of us die. These are all calls to adventure.

   There are, of course, many calls to adventure we evaluate. Some we
   accept. Others we reject. We break up with that person. We accept
   that marriage proposal. We take one job while we decline another. We
   move or we stay put.

#. Have you accepted Calls to Adventure that you wish you would have
   refused? Certainly.

Mentor
------

#. This story has a full-blown mentor, Grand Master Awk, Emeritus.

#. Does not apply.

#. Ronnie has a general sort of ethics. She comes from Ptolemy City in
   the Pharaoh Star System. This city started out as a haven for space
   pirates. Later it became a place for powerful humans to operate
   outside the law. As a result, Ronnie does not consider certain kinds
   of behavior unethical or illegal. However, the powerful soon learned
   that they needed to rule of law to apply to their work force. These
   people are protected by labor laws and constrained in other ways.
   Nevertheless, it is important to remember that assassination, for
   example, is legal where Ronnie comes from.

   Ronnie's first job was as a police officer. Later she became a
   private investigator and had a contract with the Alliance of Free
   Planets. Working for an intelligence agency meant she had a certain
   latitude in her operation. Later Ronnie worked in several alien
   cultures and managed to understand their ethical systems. Now she
   must understand those of The Magic Lands.

#. Ronnie has a well-developed conscience. This manifests itself most
   clearly concerning personal loyalty. Ronnie is flexible with right
   and wrong. She values her autonomy and despises exploitation of the
   weak, theft and betrayal.

#. Ronnie is open to mentors. As this story begins, she has just
   completed The War Crimes Investigation course. She had a mentor when
   she was training to be a police officer. She is, however, at odds
   with Grand Master Awk, Emeritus because she does not like him, trust
   him or like her assignment.

First Threshold
---------------

The audience knows that we’ve gone from one world to the next because we
have traveled in a spaceship through hyperspace to get there. The
ordinary world looks futuristic. The next world looks medieval at the
space port and non-industrial beyond it. Ronnie (and presumably the
audience) is disoriented. She expected The Magic Lands to appear even
more futuristic.
Ronnie continues to be unwilling. She does her homework, determined not
to fail, but she continues to be uneasy about the whole venture. Her
reasons are twofold:

#. She still doesn't like the idea of magic.
#. Yes. The threshold guardians in the form of the captain, the setting
   and the locals at the River Walk raise questions which makes it
   difficult for Ronnie to be totally committed to her role. Her heart
   is not in it. She keeps thinking she is missing something important.
#. Ronnie deals with the threshold guardians by listening and observing.
   She asks questions and tries to draw conclusions while staying open
   to more information.

Questions for Lesson Four
-------------------------

Tests Allies Enemies

    Describe your special world in one solid paragraph (physical and
    mental welcomed.) Why do Heroes go through a series of tests? Why
    not go right through to the main event? Could you increase the
    contrast between Ordinary and Special World? How? What are the ways
    your Hero is tested? (There are no right ways; this is according to
    your story.) Is your Hero alone or with a group? Yes/No? Are you
    constructing an ensemble piece? Yes/No? (Elaborate upon this if you
    wish to flesh out the group your hero will be working with, again,
    this is according to your story.) How does your Hero react to the
    special world?

Approaching the Innermost Cave

    What are the continued tests you are making your characters go
    through? What special preparations are leading to the middle of your
    story / the crisis? Does the conflict build? Do obstacles get more
    difficult? Explain. Does your Hero want to turn back or is he/she
    fully committed? Explain. In what ways is your Hero facing external
    forces while also dealing with inner demons and defenses? Is there
    an actual villain and his cave or an emotional equivalent?

Lesson Five     Questions
=========================


The Supreme Ordeal

We are at a very, very important point in your story. Go back and ask the question:

    What is your main character’s greatest fear? Ronnie's greatest
    fear is being controlled or manipulated by others.

By answering that question, you should be able to construct your main crisis—you should be able to construct the scenes/paragraphs of this step. (That’s just a hint.)

#.  Just what is your story’s supreme ordeal? When Ronnie goes to
    prevent Roop from contacting The People of the Rain Sky, Roop
    attempts to block her interference with magic. Realizing that Roop
    is starting to control her body and her thoughts, Ronnie uses her
    own magic to combat him. The opposing forces of magic overloads the
    transfer controller. It sheds the magic in order to shut down. The
    ensuing magic blast kills Roop, Grand Master Awke who has felt the
    magic overload and has come to find out what is going on, and
    knocks Ronnie unconscious. 

-  In what ways is your Villain or Villain-energy your Hero’s shadow?
   Roop believes Grand MAsters Awke and Vesha are in his way to become
   Grand Master. Unwilling to wait, he has accepted The People of the
   Rainbow Sky's promise to instate him as Grand Master when they
   conquer The MAgic Lands. He is ambitious like Ronnie and impatient
   with bureaucracy.
   
-  Is the villain’s power channeled through other
   characters/archetypes? If yes, give an example. Yes. Roop acts as
   an ally and a mentor to Ronnie. As a person of interest to The
   People of the Rainbow Sky, he plans to turn her over to them all
   the while he is ingraciating himself to her.
   
#. Ronnie faces actual death when she uses magic to stop Roop's magic.
   There are unattended consequences. The Transfer Controller 

-  Is your story gaining momentum at this point? Yes.

Lesson Six Questions
====================

    
Reward, Road Back, Resurrection
Reward
------

1. The modern version of my campfire scene is Ronnie's hospital
   bedside. Here Ronnie gets to tell Grand Mistress Vesha her story.
   Grand Mistress Vesha fills Ronnie in on what has happened since
   Ronnie passed out. She also advises Ronnie that there will be a
   tribunal concerning her actions. She is charged with causing the
   deaths of Grand Master Awk and Senior Master Roop and exceeding her
   authority to practice magic.
2. Ronnie learns that she is willing to die to thwart The People of
   the Rainbow Sky. She feels sad on learning Master Awk is dead. She
   did not know how fond she was of the old Tigerfu. She will miss her
   sessions with him. She realizes she was not attracted to Roop but
   to his magical power. She depises his betrayal of the Tigerfu.
3. Ronnie takes possession of her ability to practice magic. She
   has demonstrated her willingness to help the Tigerfu in the War
   of Consolidation.
4. The story does not change direction. It moves toward Ronnie
   accepting her role in the war. She is a wizzard.
5. Ronnie does not yet have all she needs to complete her journey.
6. There is not a new agenda.
7. Ronnie now has the tool of knowledge about herself that comes
   from the inside rather than told to her on the outside.
8. This is not a good time for a love scene.
9. Ronnie realizes, through self-examination and reviewing what she
   has been told, that she has changed.
10. Ronnie has not yet learned to deal with her inner flaws. She is, however, quite chastened.

Road Back
---------

-  Will your Hero be ejected or will he/she leave voluntarily from the
   special world? Ronnie will make The MAgic Lands her own.
-  Do you feel heroic writing your story? Some.
-   ow can you apply your feeling to your characters? This is a story
    about independence and I can make living that way very important
    to Ronnie, Tripp and Roop. 
-  Is the road back returning to the staring place? A new destination?
   Adjusting to life in the new world? The road back is adjusting to
   the new world.

Act II to Act III Turning Points Here

    Are these single moments or a series of moments?
    Is there an element of pursuit or acceleration in these sections?
    Is there urgency?
    Ask yourself: “Is everything I foreshadowed paid off in the script?”
    Are all of your questions hinted at or answered?
    Is everything paid off or will it be paid off?

Regarding the Resurrection Step

    Are there flaws that have brought your character to where they are?
    What flaws are necessary for your character to continue?
    What final order of death or ordeal does your character go through?
    What aspect of your hero is resurrected? (if at all)
    Is there a need for physical violence at the end of your story?

Keep Writing Forward
 

The Halfway Point
=================

The Writer's Journey confuses me. It makes sense when I am reading it,
but I lose the sense of it when I open this file and try to write. In a
way, it is just a construct and I can easily tell myself I don't need to
focus on it to write a story; however, I selected the course to learn
how to write a better story. As such, it seems important to learn how
this pattern works and how to alter it to my writing needs.

I am having trouble with several aspects of this project:

#. I cannot figure out point of view and narrative sstyle. Mostly, I'm
   seeing this as a movie. Nathan Lowell says he sees his stories as
   movies and just writes down what is happening. I think I have the
   setting figured out by having this movie run, but now how the story
   will be told.
#. I do not have a solid grasp on the plot. This makes writing the later
   scene summaries very hard because I don't know how this story works.
   Perhaps the best thing to do is stop worrying about the course
   questions and write the scene summaries and figure the rest out
   later. On the other hand, the questions have shown me holes and added
   possibilities.
#. I have a number of subplots or plots or whatever they are going.
   Let's see if I can list them here:

   #. Ronnie learns to be a magician.
   #. Ronnie investigates and confirms Grand Master Vesha's suspicion
      that Senior Master Roop is a spy for The People of the Rainbow
      Sky. Ronnie performs magic to stop Roop from doing magic related
      to The People of the Rainbow Sky and the project. Ronnie's magic
      has the unintended consequence of killing Roop. For practicing
      magic beyond her apprenticeship and causing Roop's death, Ronnie
      is put on trial for practicing black magic. In olden times, the
      penalty for such egregious acts was death. In more recent times,
      the death penalty has not been applied. The Tigerfu outside of The
      MAgic Lands disapprove, but the penalty has not been taken off the
      books. Grand Master Awk does not back Ronnie up. However, Tripp
      and Senior Master Gaunt do. Grand Master Vesha rules that Ronnie
      is confined to The Magic Lands. Her reasoning is that Ronnie's
      gift for magic needs to be studied and redirected. Essentially,
      Ronnie is put under house arrest. Senior Master Gaunt will now
      have authority over her.
   #. I haven't sorted out why there is friction between Grand Master
      Vesha and Ronnie, but there is. Grand Master Vesha is not exactly
      a vi villain in this piece, but definitely an antagonist.
   #. Although I think of Grand Master Awk as a kindly old man, he is
      not. He is once powerful wizzard who has lost his touch. His
      short-term memory is failing. He has been called out of retirement
      to help Grand Master Vesha figure out what is wrong at the
      project. (This project needs a name for sure.) He does not stand
      up for Ronnie at her trial. He mixes things up and his testimony
      is filled with inaccuracies which Ronnie cannot refute because its
      her word against his. By doing what she did, Ronnie did not allow
      Grand MAster Awk to solve the problems at the project.
   #. Tripp and Ronnie notice something wrong at the River Walk. Mostly
      the apprentices are kept away from the general populous. Ronnie is
      convinced the wizzards are enslaving the people somehow. She
      wants to get to the bottom of this. How can she do this in this
      story? Perhaps it is just an unresolved piece that can be explored
      in another book or it figures into the trial period somehow.
   #. And there is Tripp's unrequited love for Ronnie. Should this stay
      in the story or should Tripp just be a friend. Should Ronnie be
      attracted to Roop be dropped or should Roop become a female
      magician? I've always thought of Roop as male, but it would be
      easy enough to change that, creating a love triangle. If a love
      triangle, then how do Ronnie and Tripp resolve that after Roop's
      death? Would a spell be necessary to have Ronnie attracted to Roop
      or could that be something Tripp and Ronnie make up later to
      explain why things did not work for them at the beginning? This
      sounds awkward. The less magic the better, I think. An ordinary
      love triangle sounds far more practical.?
   #. Ronnie thinks the story she is being told by the grand
      masters does not add up. What doesn't add up? What are they
      keeping from her? What does she find out? How does this
      affect what happens with Roop and what happens at her trial?
      This all must hang together. What is the secret agenda here?

4. Clearly there are too many subplots, but I think they can be
   sorted. I think I will keep Roop a male. Ronnie is not
   attracted to him because he is male but because she is
   attracted to the power of his magic. Using power wisely is
   Ronnie's personal test in this story.
5. Neither grand master likes it, but magic is stagnant in The Magic
   Lands. Every magician uses the same spells to achieve the same
   results. They need someone new, someone with news ideas and a new
   way of doing things. Ronnie is that new person. The Tigerfu have
   many gifts, but originality is not one of their strong suits.
   Ronnie is the only example they have of a human being, but the
   ancient literature says their race was extremely creative. When the
   grand masters reached out for a solution, they found Ronnie at the
   War Crimes Investigation School. They were extremely pleased with
   her investigation background and it is an excellent cover for
   bringing her to The Magic Lands. It is also why the initial charges
   against Ronnie are so extreme. They want to keep her. A sense of
   propriety and justice does intervene to make her sentence shorter,
   but Grand Master Vesha wants to keep her forever. Down the road, of
   course, Ronnie will challenge Grand Master Vesha and succeed. But
   that is another story. This also explains the poor conditions on
   the planet. The poor state of magic is reflected in the poor state
   of the people and animals. This is why Grand Master Awk won't tell
   Ronnie about it. He won't admit magic is in trouble in The Magic
   Lands. His presentation of magic to Ronnie is romantic and full of
   ancient lore. This makes Ronnie impatient. She likes facts. 

A New Summary
=============

   Can I write a summary of this novel in twelve sentences? One
   sentence for a prologue and one sentence for an epilog.

0. Prologue: The War of Consolidation continues with The People of the
   Rainbow Sky attempting to reconquer their former colonies and the
   Tigerfu, among others, trying to repulse them. 
1. Ronniea human female, is awaiting her assignment after completing
   an introductory course on War Crimes Investigation for the
   Tigerfu.
2. Instead of receiving an assignment, Ronnie is directed to the
   Director's Office where she is told she will be working for Master
   Awk and no other information is available.
3. Ronnie meets with Master Awk where he tells her he is a wizzard and
   she is his new apprentice as well as she will investigate some
   irregularities in The MAgic Lands.
4. Ronnie becomes angry and storms out, but quickly discovers she has
   no other options except return to Master Awk.
5. Ronnie accompanies Master Awk to The MAgic Lands, becoming more
   uneasy at every turn--the sfreighter captain tries to discourage
   her from entering The MAgic Lands, the spaceport appears to be a
   medieval fortress and the city where she meets the Grand Mistress
   is too fairy-like to be believed.
6. Ronnie and Master Awk take a skyboat to the Musical Mountains,
   meeting Apprentice Tripp and Master Gaunt along the way.
7. At the Musical Mountains, Ronnie meets Roop, the senior wizzard
   in charge of a energy and material transfer project, and settles
   in to learning her craft and trying to find out if Roop or
   someone else involved with the project is crooked.
8. Ronnie discovers Roop is working for The People of the
   Rainbow Sky and that he is about to give them information
   that will disrupt the project so she steps in to disrupt
   Roop's efforts.
9. Ronnie finds herself in Magic City where she learns that she is
   under arrest for the death of Roop and Master Awk and that the
   project has been totally disrupted.
10. At her trial, Ronnie learns her yet uncontrolled abilities to do
    magic caused the disruption in the project which resulted in two
    deaths, but the project disruption has allowed Master Gaunt to
    rebuild it correctly and that her sentence is to stay on in The
    MAgic Lands because the Grand Mistress has determined Ronnie will
    be able to revitalize magic in The MAgic Lands; she puts a magic
    bracelet on Ronnie so she cannot leave.
11. Again Ronnie is horrified, but she sees an opportunity to make
    the life of the common people better so she vows to do her best.
12. Grand Mistress gives Ronnie Master Awk's staff; she must learn
    to use it wisely. 
13. Epilog: Ronnnnie goes to the Magic Archives where we last see her,
    studying a book about the ancient history of the galaxy complete
    with pictures of the Tigerfu, The People of the Rainbow Sky, the
    Fungusians, The White Bear Union people, the Fungusians, the
    Trololu and the Pantherans.

Thoughts on the Sequel
======================

**Book 2**

- Stage One: Ordinary World. Ronnie is in the library studying some
   old books. The archivist comes in with some very old books and a
   map. The archivist says the map is old, but there is no label
   saying explaining where it is. When the map is unrolled, Ronnie
   recognizes the place. She asks the archivist if she is right. This
   is a map of Tigerfu Land. Startled, the archivist looks. Ronnie
   shows him the river, the mountains, the high mountain peak. She
   tells the archivist she has been there. There are buildings along
   the river.

- Stage Two: Call to Adventure. The archivist has hurried away to
   investigate further when Ronnie receives a call from Captain Star
   Runner. The Pantheran is in orbit. Ronnie explains she cannot leave
   because of the constraints of the tribunal that passed judgment on
   her, but STar is welcome to come to the planet. Star complies
   quickly and joins Ronnie. She updates Star and shows Star the map.
   Star explains that the Fungusian Network is very interested in the
   history of Tigerfu Land. They think it may hold cluesthat will help
   in the War of Consolidation. Star wants Ronnie to accompany Star to
   Tigerfu Land which Star continues to call Planet X. The archivist
   returns and Ronnie asks the archivist if magic can be practiced on
   Planet X. The archivist says it falls within The MAgic Lands.

- Stage Three: Refusal of the Call. Ronnie and Star go to see Grand
   Mistress Vesha for Ronnie to seek permission to go to Tigerfu Land.
   At first Vesha objects. Ronnie will be out of direct supervision.
   Ronnie suggests Tripp come with them. Tripp is proficient, reliable
   and likes history. Reluctantly, Vesha agrees.

-  Stage Four: Meeting the mentor. The archivist has also been made a part of their party. The archivist will act as the mentor, the adult in charge. The archivist is very excited that there is new information on Tigerfu Land.  

- Stage Five: Crossing the Threshold: This time, the fanikula and the
   robots at the hotel prove problematic. They identify Ronnie, Tripp
   and the archivist as wizzards and do not want them to pass.
   However, they figure out to do it and get up the mountain.

Elixir:   Ronnie realizes Star (and perhaps all subjugated races) are
under a spell of compulsion to serve The People of the Rainbow Sky and
The White Bear Union. She returns to MAgic City to look up, with the
archivist's help, a way to unbind Star. Ronnie calls a Council of
Wizzards to make the charm for Star. When she puts the charm around
Star's neck, Star and Star's AI report a physiological change. At
first, Star is very sick, but then recovers and all is well. At the
end of the story, Star has passed all this information onto the
Fungusian Network. Neither Ronnie or Star know if the Fungusians are
affected by any magic. Grand Mistress Vesha passes on to the Tigerfu
military that magic may be involved in the War of Consolidation. 


The use of magic in warfare will be classified as a war crime.

   come off as being too dense. Grand Master Awke has told everyone
   how brilliant I will be someday. Besides, I want to impress Senior
   Master Roop with my abilities. I suspect he is interested in me in
   other ways, but I do not find him physically attractive. Not that

   Awke coming into the room. No time to explain. Roop is readying
   something. Now, watch this. I can do magic.)
*  Chapter Twenty-Two: Deposition in Magic City (I did not think I
   cared so much for Grand Master Awke. I am sorry he is dead. I would
   have expected Grand Mistress Vesha to be pleased I figured things
   out. She is not and I do not know what will happen at the Tribunal.
   I wish Tripp was here. She is a good friend and I did not know that
   until now. I have certainly made a mess of things. I hope I survive
   and they do not change me into a mouse or something. Can they do
   that? I mean, can they do that and if so, are they allowed to do
   that? Would a law or regulation stop them? Grand Mistress Vesha is
   very angry. She does not shout. She just gets colder and colder.
   That kind of fury is hard to take.)
*  Chapter Twenty-two: The Tribunal. I cannot believe it. Senior
   Master Gaunt is testifying on my behalf. Tripp is, too. They are
   making the case that I acted to stop Roop from sending out the
   message and therefore my punishment should be lessened. They agree
   with Grand Mistress Vesha that my use of magic was not well thought
   out, but they insist Grand Master Awke's death was an accident. I
   could not have anticipated that he would come into the transmission
   room. He did normally take a nap at that time. Senior Master Gaunt
   suggests that Grand MAster Awke came because he sensed trouble or
   the inappropriate use of magic. Senior Master Gaunt admits he did
   not realize somehting was wrong until our magical fight, but he
   strongly believes Master Awke was far more sensitive. Grand
   Mistress Vesha cannot help herself. She believes it, too.      
*  Chapter Twenty-Three: The Verdict      . I am going to be stuck
   here. I am basically under house arrest though I can travel
   anywhere in The Magic Lands. Senior Master Gaunt and Grand Mistress
   Vesha are convinced I will be a very powerful wizzard some day if I
   study. I still quite get my head around this. Tripp says I should
   feel very fortunate. Grand Mistress Vesha will oversee my training.
   I'm not so sure.
*  Chapter Twenty-Four: The Book in the Library. Grand Mistress Vesha
   has sent me to the archives. It's a very spooky building. I expect
   the gargoils to spring to life at any moment. Shen is the archivist
   and a senior master wizzard in his own right. I ask him why the
   books have not been digitized. He says it is because they may
   contain magic and you cannot digitize magic. I ask if digitizing
   them will hurt them. He says no so I start the process with my
   studies. In the room where I am working, there are maps. They are
   two-dimensional and I realize they are star charts. I ask Archivist
   Shen about them. He says they are quite old and he does not know
   much else about them except there is something magical about them.
   He goes away and comes back to say they will create a
   three-dimensional picture of space. He shows me how. It is quite
   impressive. I get absorbed in casting the spell, looking at the
   chart and then undoing the spell again. I report to Grand Mistress
   Vesha. She simply reminds me to study my lessons, but she does not
   forbid me from looking at the maps. This is a good thing.
   
*  Chapter Twenty-five: The Star Chart I Can Read (I wander through
   the archives, looking for more maps. There are lots of them. I work
   out their spells and look at more and more charts. None of them are
   familiar. Then I find a very old map. Its spell is very hard. I use
   all the things I have been taught to work it out. I walk around,
   among the stars themselves, and I see it. Here ishe star system
   where Planet X is located. Captain Star Runner and I learned it is
   not called Planet X but Tigerfu Land. It is the Tigerfu original
   homeland., Tigerfu Land has a special marker attached to it. This
   marker says it is part of The Magic Lands although it is not near
   where I am. I ask Archivist Shen about this. He confirms it. I ask
   him for more information on the planet. I do not tell him I have
   been there recently. He brings me a very old book. Together we work
   to open it. It is closed by very strong magic. Archivist Shen he cannot open it.
*  Chapter Twenty-Six: I Open the Book. I explain all this to Grand
   Mistress Vesha. I have learned to read her fairly well. She is both
   surprised and excited though she does not want me to know this. She
   instructs me to discover how to open the book. I object. If the
   archivist cannot open it, why does she think I, a mere apprentice,
   cannot open it. She begrudgingly explains that Archivist Shen has
   already contacted her about the book. It has a special magical
   lock. Only someone with great magical power can open the book...
   Grand Mistress Vesha wants to know if I am such a person. I go back
   to the archives and work on it. In time, I open it. There before me
   are beautiful pictures. I recognize the animals in them. Or should
   I say people. The Pantherans are there along with the Fungusians
   and the Featherote. I also see Tigerfu and what are the White Bear
   People. There are humanoids which must be The Peoploe of the
   Rainbow Sky and those like Samara and Beja. And here are Trololu,
   too. The script is ancient. I cannot decifer it. To read the book I
   must learn more. Archivist Shen documents my ability to open the
   book. He marvels are the pictures, too. I tell him what some of the
   strange beings are. Grand Mistress Vesha comes to look at the book,
   too. She is not so interested in what the book contains but in the
   fact that I can open the book. It confirms Grand Master Awke's
   assessment that I am will become a great wizzard. I don't know if I
   am happy about this. It means I must stay here, probably forever.
   Well, I wanted a new homeland. I just didn't think it would be like this.
