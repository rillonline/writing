<p>Well, not really snow. More like heavy frost, a covering, icy. Off we go. Elwood has never worked in snow and ice. Fortunately, he grew up where he has already encountered what it is. And like my other dog, snow is good. I'm wondering how he will understand that human beings do not have 4-paw drive. My shoes held up. Elwood held up. Even I held up. We made our excursion without anyone falling down. Hurray!
