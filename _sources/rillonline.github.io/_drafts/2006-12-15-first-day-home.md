<p>It has been a long day perhaps because we have been tied to each other.
<p>We have been out to breakfast, greeting old friends and learning how to behave when there is so much to sniff.
<p>We've been to the post office and walked around a little. We met our mobility instructor who said we looked good. Elwood had been laying down some paw and avoided the ramp at City Hall.
<p>Our greatest accomplishment was at park. We have found appropriate places and Elwood is relaxing enough to do what is necessary. It took 36 hours to get something to clean up. This is normal but nerve racking.
<p>Our biggest laugh was having me climb into the back of the truck for grocery shopping. It's a long way up and the seat is low inside so ballast is an issue. Being young and thin, Elwood bounds in and out. He did take a turn at the driver's seat. We laughed and laughed.
<p> Elwood also knows a few handy commands like ... inside. It means find your way into the building. For us, it means find the door to the apartment building from the street.
