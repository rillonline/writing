<p>When I woke up this morning, the radio said it was 14 degrees. Brr.
<p>This was Elwood's first real test of working in snow. Curbs are hard to find. It is icy in places.
<p>He moves fast so I had to concentrate on slowing him down. Secondly, I had to find the curbs. I was doing okay for a while, then we had a crossing or two where Elwood had veered. This is not all his fault. The curb cuts are not always one for each street but at the point, one ramp for the two right angled streets and these are difficult for dogs. 
<p>We went to a favorite restaurant of mine. It was Elwood's first trip. We found the restaurant okay. We sat at a table by the window. The server removed a chair so Elwood would have plenty of room. He wanted to sit up and look out the window. So long as he didn't wiggle, I allowed it. He wasn't bothering anyone. On the way home we had trouble picking up one of the curb cuts and had to wade through some snow to cross. A bit sloppy but as I always say: No honking horns, no screeching of brakes, no broken glass. We were fine.
<p>Elwood is still having difficulty understanding that in church people move around but he is to stay still.
