The weather is better--much better. I haven't had to wear a winter coat for several days. In fact, I haven't had to wear a jacket today except for early this morning.

Getting ready for church this morning, when I came out of the shower I found Elwood happily wagging his tail while sitting on the bed. Oh no, Elwood. I don't think so!

And at church, perhaps climbing in my lap, standing on the pew, looking to see who might be coming in the door? Oh no, Elwood. You had better wear your gentle leader.

And in Tim Horton's, laying down quietly? Oh no, Merrill, I don't think so.

We both agreed, however, that walking home from Brooklyn Square is a great idea. Up hill all the way, but it was so, so glorious Oh yes!.
