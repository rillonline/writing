<p>A long day ... up at 5:30. Left the Seeing Eye at 9. Flight delayed. Arrived Buffalo 2 pm. With collecting baggage, tending to Elwood's needs, a midafternoon meal, we got back to Jamestown at 5. Unpacked. Ate again. Out with Elwood twice. Getting into a routine is difficult. Writing on my desktop is also difficult. We're off to bed.
