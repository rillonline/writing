<p>Today I read the Gospel at the Easter morning service at ST. Luke's. This meant walking from the chancel down the center aisle to the middle of the church. There was someone with the book and torchbearers, I think. Elwood did okay being part of the parade. Packs are good. When I came to the person holding the book for me to read, I stopped, stepped to the middle and told Elwood to lay down. 

"Right here, in the middle of the aisle?" Elwood was quite shocked.

But he did what he was told and I proceeded with the reading. Then we had to step aside and let the procession procede us back to the chancel. This iwas a little shakier since we missed our seat but, no harm no foul.

It continues to snow and be cold. The priest almost wished us a Merry Christmas. It seemed more appropriate to the weather.
