### December 21, 2016

while dashing up and down the yard tonight, Nick jerked the long leash out of my hands. I called to him to come back. As he ran past, Nick touched my hand with his nose, then continued running. He did this once or twice more before stopping and allowing me to pick up the leash. I did have to correct him for pulling it out of my hands a second time. Then I decided to come in. holding a wet, IC Flexi leash is not a fun proposition. Nick sat with me and observed me wiping the unit off when I came inside. He seemed very concerned that it could be restored to its compact and dry condition.
