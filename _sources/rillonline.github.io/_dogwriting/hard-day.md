### January 6, 2017

It is very cold today. The temperature is below 6. The wind is below 0.

Nick had a hard time peeing today. I took him out before exercise and lunch. Finally, the second. outing, I got something.

While resting at the Senior Center, suddenly, Nick jumped up and barked several times. Nick's voice is in the medium range and very loud. There seemed to be nothing to bark at. Jill thought he might have been dreaming and woke himself up. The bark came out in the waking world but it was intended for the dreaming one.

Later Nick pooped in the grocery store. That was hard.

I truly think his body is all messed up because of his allergy. He didn't pee again until suppertime though I took him out midafternoon which is one of his favorite times. I think he just can't eliminate when he wants to but only when it is absolutely necessary.

I hope his allergy medicine kicks in soon.

When Nick has a hard day, I have one, too.

Happily, Nick loves toys and played for a. bit. He loves his rope, crackle bone and wubba. His puppy mom mentioned he loves to have all the toys out. I'm experiencing this. There are toys everywhere on the floor. He may not even play with them but they have to be out of the toy box.

Maybe he is settling in more here with me. It is a slow process.
