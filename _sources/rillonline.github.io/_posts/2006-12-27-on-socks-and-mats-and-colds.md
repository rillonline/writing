<p>It's absolutely dreary here. I read the weekend forecast for Milwaukee and it will be the same there. So much for concern about snow. So much for my plan about coat, etc. 
<p>We did have a touch of snow this morning. More slippery than anything else to say about it.
<p>I've been dealing with a cold or some thing so have given being sick priority to get done before Friday. It has blown a hole in what I had planned to do this week. No energy at all. I have made myself walk with Elwood some as he would be unmanageable otherwise. He has had to be patient  about park times and has done really well.
<p>At a friend's house, Elwood found another dog's play sock and had great fun with it Unfortunately, when I had difficulty getting up this morning, he used his mat as a sock and chewed a corner. I have a second one on order so this one can be sewed. 1000 teal poop bags came today. They're all contained in one box that is quite manageable as are the bags so we're set for a good while. I elected not to order rose or green ones.
