Nick and I marched in the Bay View 4th of July parade. I say "marched". We walked. Nick thought it was quite strange to walk in the street. My walking companion was concerned that we stayed together and marched sort of in formation. Nick was fascinated by the people and dogs along the parade route.

Being in a parade is very different than watching a parade go by. There is little sense of being part of a whole. There was me, Nick, my walking companion, Nancy, and perhaps a few other church members but no sense of the entire parade. There was no band playing patriotic music--at least not close enough for us to hear. Although there was a sense of community beforehand, people immediately split off to have ice cream individually and then break away to walk home. I won't know for a couple days how Nick feels about streets as we have no plans until Friday night. It is so hot out. He was good with sidewalks and curbs on the way home and there were no vehicles near us during the parade.
