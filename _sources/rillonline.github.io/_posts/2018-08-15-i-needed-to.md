I needed to take a bit of a break from traveling by bus. Now that I have had this bus vacation, Nick and I traveled by bus yesterday. We had a pleasant surprise. At our transport point it is sometimes difficult to know where the bus stop is. A man told me I was at the bus stop and ask me which bus I was waiting for. It turns out he lives in my building. How delightful!
