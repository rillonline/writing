Took the bus this morning to Pilates. Standing at the bus stop. Standing at the bus stop. Standing at the bus stop where is the bus? One lane only at the airport is delaying my bus and all the other buses that have to go through there. Finally get on the bus after I am supposed to be there. As the class is one on one, I texted the instructor and all was well. We get to the transfer station. Usually, I stay on the bus. However,Today it is everyone off the bus. It is 35 minutes late they say. So we are told to walk to the bus behind us. A nice lady asks if she can help me and she and her husband see to it that I get on the bus which is a very good thing because there is a high step up onto the bus. Connect with my instructor and have a very good session. Afterwords, we stop at a taco stand and I get to vegan tacos, chips and guacamole. Delicious. Will stop at there again.
