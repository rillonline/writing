Mirroring my <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> site created some unexpected results. My [rillonline.github.io](https://rillonline.github.io/) site was entirely replaced to look identical to [rill.micro.blog](http://rill.micro.blog/). I had a few bad moments with <code>git</code> and lots of emails from [github](https://github.com/), but I think this will be all right in the end.
