 April is about to start. I have decided to participate in Camp Nanowrimo this year with no clear goal in mind. Two possible writing goals are on the  table:
 
 1. Continue to work on my Three Laws of Magic novel. With a modest goal — the minimum goal of 10,000 words — this seems doable.

2. Use the 30 days of April for a sustainable Write Every Day goal and see if I can write something I can blog every day. At some level, this is a harder goal because it requires me to plan and to execute. I cannot let the day’s activities dictate wether I write or not. April is shaping up to be a busy month for me. However, to make the minimum goal of 10,000 words, I need only write 334 words a day to achieve it. I don’t have to write this many words every day. Some days I will write less and some days I will write more. The point is, to achieve my own Write Every Day goal, I must write daily. 

In either case, I want to write on my Braille notetaker and prepare the day’s writing this way to expand and cement my knowledge of my Braille notetaker and become more familiar with its editing capabilities.
