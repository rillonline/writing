Crazy day today. Couldn't sleep last night so did some listening. Eventually fell asleep. Slept through my Echo alarm. Woke up late. Took Nick out and hurried through breakfast. While in the shower, one of my friends from Bible study called. Did I want a ride question I sure did. Set that up. Enriching Bible study. Decided to get a ride home as no one was available to go To lunch. Couldn't find my Bluetooth connector for my phone and hearing aid. Dashed off to my salon appointment. When I went around the corner on KK, no sidewalk. No one answered me when I shouted out to people around a truck. Earbuds? Too much noise? Indifferent?. Went back around Collectivo and across Smith. Crossed South Graham. Nick hung a right. Went with that. I think we went through several alleyways and across the street. Eventually, Nick worked his way back to KK and back to the salon. What a day! And the Bluetooth connector? It was already on my shirt.
