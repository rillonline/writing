Today I made a step forward in finding ways to protect myself. I have made a pact with a steady parishioner at my church. I will be in text contact with her every Sunday morning. If I say I am coming to church but I don't show up, my contact will take steps to find me.

To facilitate my accountability I have set up a recurringreminder to text my contact every Sunday morning concerning my plans.
