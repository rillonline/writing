Early this morning I heard a promo for an NPR program interviewing the president of Smith College. 

When I was young, my mother took us to the Smith College book sale in Princeton. We went more than a single time I am sure. The ladies--you could not call them anything else--were very proper and precise. My mother commented later that they were the upperclass of Princeton society. What else? They graduated from Smith. 

My mother must have bought books. I suspect they were novels. My encounter with the Smithies was when my mother paid.

Thinking back, these women must have married well. They served their community by volunteering for worthy causes and raising money for their alma mater to educate more women for their new place in society. #WriteEveryDay
