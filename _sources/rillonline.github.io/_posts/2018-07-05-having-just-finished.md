Having just finished reading *Closed Casket* by Sophy Hannah, I must conclude I love country house murder mysteries. Properly speaking, Lily Oaak is not a country house. It is the extended family home in the country. Nevertheless, a number of suspects are confined to the property until the murder is solved. Hannah is writing more Hercule Poirot mysteries in conjunction with Christie's estate. 

Although Poirot makes an excursion to England (We only have telephone conversations from there.) this mystery does not have a lot of toing and froing which often makes mysteries tedious. Of course witnesses are re-interviewed. Both Inspector Edward Catchpool and Poirot keep talking to both guests and residents of the house.

This is a much better book than *The Monogram Murders* and I am looking forward to the next novel in the series.
