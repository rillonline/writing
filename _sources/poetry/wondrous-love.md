# "Wondrous Love" #

It seemed a good and noble thing to  
leave heaven's throne for a poor, landless, itinerant life.  
It seemed a good and noble thing to  
tell people of God's fair and just rule.  
It seemed a good and noble thing  
to use God's power to heal the sick, restore the disabled and even raise the dead.  
It seemed a good and noble thing to  
challenge authority and walk where the prophets of old spoke and performed their signs and wonders.  
Whether by divine guidance or human treachery,  
I lie facedown in the garden,  
knowing public humiliation, torture and death  
most certainly await me unless--  
One writer will say I sweated blood.  
Scholars will scoff;  
will decry hyperbole.  
Blood is life.  
Human fragility defies divine strength.  
Human fear wrestles divine love.  
It is finished.  
It is a good and noble thing to  
Commend my spirit into God's hands.  
What wondrous love is this  
O my soul  
O my soul.
