Planet X: The next day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ADMONITION:: Note to Self

		          Some way of denoting time is necessary. The
			  next day may not be sufficient.
			  Alternatively, I can delete any reference to
			  place and time and just go with chapter
			  numbers and names if possible.

To keep it simple, I will summarize what happened during the rest of evening.

1. The robot concierge confirmed that the two archiology students,
   Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I were the only ones registered at
   the Hotel Vista Incredible. The robot concierge additionally
   confirmed that we were the only living beings in the hotel.

2. This left Detective Ronnie Camberwell weighing the possibility that
   Hericles Beja had killed Suri Nam, but after questioning the living
   archiology student, Detective Ronnie Camberwell believed him when
   he said 	he had not killed Suri Nam. What reason, he asked
   reasonably, would he have to kill her. They had worked together for
   two standard years on their project. They were both concerned what
   their impact their findings would have on the archiological
   community in the primary arm and had reached out for protection.
   They did not stand to profit either academically or financially from their research and their conclusions, so he would have no reason to eliminate a potential competitor.

3. The robot concierge also confirmed that no one else had come to
   the Hotel Vista Incredible during the last two standard years.

4. The robot concierge removed Suri Nam's body. It said it would be
   reserved indefinitely.

5. Detective Ronnie Camberwell decided Heracles Beja shold move into
   our Vista Incredible suite. I could take up a guard position by the
   door to the gallery. To my way of thinking, this also meant that I
   was between Detective Ronnie Camberwell's sleeping chamber (That is
   what the Hotel Vista Incredible called it.) and hericles Beja. I
   did not trust him as the exchange which follows shows.


"Hericles Beja had to have killed Suri Nam," I told Detective
   Ronnie Camberwell early the next morning. "He is the only one that
   could have done it."

"But it makes no sense for him to do that," Detective Ronnie
   Camberwell insisted.

"If you eliminate the impossible," I quoted, "Then you are left
   with the truth no matter how improbable it may seem." I was very
   proud to produce this quotation from Sherlock Holmes at the proper
   time.

			     does not sound exactly right.
