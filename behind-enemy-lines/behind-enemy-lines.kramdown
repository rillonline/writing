A Ronnie Camberwell Adventure Book 4
------------------------------------

The Adventures of Star Runner, the Pantheran Book Unknown
---------------------------------------------------------

by Rill

Preface to the Second Edition
-----------------------------

As in my previous book, this one is told from several perspectives. I
am the primary narrator, but Captain Star Runner also narrates events
from her perspective. At times we speak in our own voice. At other
times, I have taken the liberty of narrating in the third person to
introduce information and perspectives that I did not have at the time
but which will help you, the reader, make sense of this convoluted
tale.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

I cannot assume you know our backgrounds. (This adventure in our
series has become, to Star's delight, quite popular and our readers
back home are gravitating to it rather than reading our older
adventures in order.) Captain Star Runner and I have moved to another
area of the galaxy. We call our own area the Spiral . The people here
call theirarea of space the Primary Zone.

I am a human being from the Pharaoh Star System. My background is
police enforcement in Ptolemy City. Captain Star Runner is a
fuchsia-colored genderless Pantheran. I call Star *her*. Others call
Star *him*. Star is most comfortable with *it*. I am not.

Once we were a registered couple. We broke up. We're together again
but we have not made it legally binding. This arrangement is working
well enough. Captain Star Runner makes her living as a courier. She is
genetically engineered by the Pantheran Institute of Genetic Design to
live in conjunction with an artificial intelligence to pilot a
starship and to have the AI manage her biological functions. The AI is
called Christabel

I do not like living aboard a spaceship and traveling about. Star
finds this odd since Ptolemy City is a domed area of Hypatia which has
an extremely violent and toxic atmosphere. I think it is the presence
of a sky. The dome over Ptolemy City is clear and I can always look up
to see scudding yellow and red clouds with bursts of other colors
swirling overhead. The ceiling on a spaceship and the solid walls
gives me a sense of being hemmed in. Star Runner finds this feeling
comforting and reassuring. I find it claustrophobic.

The space station called Half Moon Bay is a bit more open. I have a
cubbyhole there and make the space station my home. I come aboard
Captain Star Runner's ride whenever she is in port. I also frequent
the hydroponic gardens and other open areas on the space station.

Half Moon Bay Space Station is run by the Space Traders Guild. This is a loose confederation of humanoid peoples. Among these are the Rabbit People. Captain Star Runner made friends with a Rabbit Man named Salim in her adventure *Sanctuary, National Novel Writing Month 2011*. I
operate as an investigator there with Jack Whitier.

Historical Notes to Help You
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thousands of years ago the Primary Zone used to be controlled by the People of the Rainbow
Sky. Their empire abutted those of the Listrans and the Followers of
the Stars. In the Spiral, the Union of the White Bear controlled the
Pantherans, the Featherote Charm, the Fungusians and the Trololu. The White Bears
destroyed the Trololu. The White Bears traded with the People  of the
Rainbow Sky.

The Listran Empire is disintegrating. The People of the Rainbow Sky
are coming back from a long decline. The White Bears have become
insular and no longer appear to participate in galactic affairs. The
Followers of the Stars are nowhere to be found. 

I tell you all this to get you ready for this current adventure.

Half Moon Bay Space Station: (Previously)
-----------------------------------------

"Let me understand you." Captain Star Runner sat up on her pedestal in
the control center of her ride. "You want me to take you to Planet X?"

"That's right," I said.

"for what purpose?"

"I need to guard some people I will meet there."

"Why?"

"The less I say about this case the better," I said.

Star twitched her tail. She was getting agitated.

"I don't like secrets," she said. "I share everything with you."

I sighed.

Star twitched her tail again.

I had not meant to sigh out loud.

"Privacy is not the same as keeping secrets," I said.

How many times had I gone over this same ground with Star Runner?
Since her interface with the AI Christabel was a two-way exchange of
data, Star Runner could not understand withholding information from an
intimate. She expected our relationship to function on the same level
of exchange. She had purchased an information link which was
integrated into my nervous system. With this I could access the space
station wide network. I could also interface with Christabel. In this
way Star Runner expected me to interface with her. That I did not
fully trust Christabel with all my thoughts dumbfounded Star Runner.
She could not imagine nor had she ever lived without an AI sharing her
thought space. I found the whole concept repugnant. I want my own self
hood. I do not want to share my innermost thoughts and feelings with
two alien minds, the Fungus artificial intelligence Christabel and the
Pantheran engineered Star Runner. I do not want to share that level of
intimacy with any other human either. It is not a racial preference on
my part.

"This case has a lot of cloak and dagger about it," I said, regretting
my words as soon as I spoke them. Cloak and dagger would spark Star
Runner's interest for sure.

"Really?" Star's ears swiveled this way and that on top of her head as
if she could hear something I was not saying.

"Two archaeological students need guarding. I'm going to Planet X. If
you go along, I can use the cover of going on holiday."

"To Planet x?" Star Runner was incredulous.

"There's a hotel on top of a mountain from what I understand. There's
a funicularl that runs up the side of the mountain to get there."

"The hotel is barely functioning."

Christabel inserted herself into our conversation. I was annoyed. She
was always there, always listening, always making a record of what we
said and what we did. This was Star Runner's memory bank.

Christabel said, "It would be a tough cover to maintain."

"It is all I have." I felt defeated. Planet X was where the students
had made some sort of discovery. I was hazy on the details. They
thought their discovery would upset certain powerful entities and one
of them had asked for protection. The request came to me. I needed
work so I had made the contract. Now it looked like Star Runner would
not help me and how would I get to Planet X?

"a vacation with you could be fun," Star Runner said.

"Vacation is a cover story," I explained as patiently as I could. "It
doesn't mean it will actually be a vacation."

"But people will have to think we are on vacation," Star Runner
pointed out. "That means we will have a nice room and go to meals
together and do some fun things."

I was beginning to think Star was warming up to the idea. As for me, I
was thinking my initial idea was a bad one. Everyone in the Primary
Zone knew about genderless Pantherans. They did not go on vacations.

En Route to Planet X
--------------------

Planet X lies in a region of space which has no definite affiliation.
Any star map will show that Planet X cannot be in the Space Traders
Guild. The star systems that align with Space Trader sentiments are in
close proximity to one another. Traditionally, as far as the records I
can find show, Planet X has never been associated with the Space
Traders Guild.

Another possibility for association is the empire the the People of
the Rainbow Sky. Planet X is far beyond any region claimed by them
throughout their long history..

Lystran records do speak of Planet X, but not as part of the Lystran
Empire. The Lystran Empire did not extend as far as Planet X's star
system at any time in its documented history.

My final query bore fruit. In long dorment archives of the Fungusian
Network, I found a star chart from before the founding of the network
itself. A note on the chart stated its provinence could not be
verified. Nevertheless, it showed Planet X as falling into the central
area of space controlled by the Followers of the Stars.

Although their name was known to us, who they were and what happened
to them was lost to us. I wondered if we would find out. I tagged the
chart, our flight plan and Detective Ronnie Camberwell's mission and
forwarded it to the Network. Perhaps more information would come my
way during the course of our journey.

As for Planet X itself, its history is poorly documented. I find this
surprising as record keeping is something the Empire of the Rainbow
Sky and Lystran are quite diligent about. Empires usually are. Empires
spawn huge bureaucracies which delight in keeping track of everything.
Its job security for a lot of people. Lystra and the Empire of the
Rainbow Sky are no different from the Pantherans, the Featherote
Charm, the Fungusian Network or the Solar League. They keep records.

I exist to correlate all the data I can access. (I really wish Ronnie
would let me correlate all the data she possesses but I suppose that
is an unrealistic rule coded into my instruction set. But then, the
Fungusian Network is all about the data.) I understand Captain Star
Runner. I do not understand Ronnie Camberwell. Perhaps it is because
we do not share mind space.

Back to Planet X ...

I looked up the history for Planet X's name. Not surprisingly, there
were many explanations, but the one that makes the most sense is that
Planet X's real designation is a sacred word. Sacred to whom or what I
could not determine. To say the sacred name aloud is blasphemy. So
people started to refer to it as Planet X.

Perhaps at one time there were other settlements on Planet X for worship
or whatever sacred rites were practiced on the sacred planet, but right
now there was only one vast hotel on the top of a very high mountain.
The hotel was Captain Star Runner and Ronnie Camberwell's destination.

Captain Star Runner

Planet X: Evening
-----------------

"It was a dark and stormy night."

"That is a cliché."

I hate it when Christabel edits my narratives.

"But it is a cliché," Christabel insists.

"I cannot help that," I say. "It was a dark and stormy night when we
arrived on Planet X."

"Maybe you could find other words to say the same thing," Christabel
suggests.

"Then you write the narrative," I say.

"You do not have to fluff up over the opening sentence of your
narrative," Christabel says. "Just find some more words to describe
our arrival on Planet X."

"Okay," I say. "How about this:

I rarely land my ride planet side. It is capable of such a landing. I
am capable of executing such a landing. However, my general work is
running my ride from one space station to another with occasional
transfers of cargo between rides in space.

We arrived during planet night for the spaceport. The atmosphere was
disturbed by a local thunderstorm. It was quite severe. Great arcs of
lighting pulsed through the sky. Rain poured down onto the ground.

The so-called spaceport was no such thing. It was a landing area with
several small outbuildings. These looked more like sheds than hangers
or passenger facilities. I shivered and hoped I would not need to make
any repairs. I had landed my ride only using an auto beacon.
Apparently anyone who came to Planet X needed to be a skilled runner
or had lots of practice with this landing area.

When I shut the landing engines down, we could hear the rain and wind
outside.

I do not like going planet side. I am a creature of space and to be
honest, the out-of-doors scares me. I hide it of course. The members
of the Race have a proud history of conquering the first the savannas
of our home world and then moving on to the less hospitable areas of
Panthera. Nevertheless, I was anxious to stay inside my ride until the
storm passed.

But Ronnie was anxious to get to the hotel and check on her charges. I
steeled myself for the unpleasantness of going outside.

To my astonishment, a conveyance was waiting for us when I went to the
hatch. When I slid the hatch open, we could exit the ride and make
ourselves comfortable in the conveyance without going outside and more
important to me, without getting wet.

When Christabel closed the hatch, the conveyance started to move. I
wondered where we were going.

A voice said: "Welcome to Planet X. Your shuttle will take you to the
funicular where you will board to be taken to your hotel. This ends
this announcement."

The voice did not speak again even when we arrived at one of the
nondescript sheds. Doors opened for us and we settled ourselves in
another vehicle. Fortunately, our luggage followed us and all doors
waited to close for the luggage to come on board.

"This is very Erie," I said.

"So far, we are making all our connections," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.

I liked it that she was a detective again. I think the title suits her
very well.

I am genetically engineered for space and weightless conditions. Our
sixteen-day run from Half Moon Bay had all been done with the least
gravity Detective Ronnie Camberwell can handle without nausea or
vertigo. We were not at all acclimated to Planet X's gravity. I was
totally unprepared for the journey up the side of the mountain.
Fortunately for me, my ancestry made it possible for me to adjust to
the climb. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was not so fortunate. She
grabbed hold of the conveniently placed grab bars and just hung on. I
wondered how anyone withstood the trip down the mountain. I supposed
we would find out when it was time to leave. Even I was not looking
forward to making the descent.

The funicular moved quickly but even so, the trip took over two hours.
I was certain Ronnie would be exhausted. She did not speak the whole
time. Neither did I. What was there to say?

When we reach the top and were on level ground, another conveyance
brought us underneath an enormous roofed area. I remembered the large
portico in the image Christabel showed us. We walked toward the large
imposing doors shut against the dark and stormy night.

As we approached, they swung open silently to admit us. We stepped
through. The doors closed silently. It was as if we were the only
people on the planet and the machinery was still in working order.

I expected the hotel to smell of rot and age. It did not. The air was
clean and fresh. The rugs underneath my paws were thick and clean.
There was no sign of decay anywhere. The lobby on Shepheard's Hotel in
Ptolemy City, the grandest hotel I had ever seen, seemed small in
comparison to this lobby. Unlike that lobby, this one was totally
empty and silent.

Ronnie and I had not exchanged a word. It seemed like to do so would
violate the silence of this place. Was this part of its sacred nature? I
remembered then that Christabel had said the name of Planet X was sacred
but there was no evidence that any sacred places existed on the planet
or that any rites had been performed here at any time in its long history. The planet's purpose was a
mystery except that plants and animals lived here. No intelligent life
forms have ever been found. The plants and animals bwho lived on the
surface and in the oceans were not particularly vicious and there was no
record of any people being attacked. More or less, it was safe if
unoccupied.

We walked toward the hotel desk. Detective Ronnie Camberwell steadied
herself by laying her hand on my shoulder. The plush of the rug made
it difficult for her to keep her balance after the ride up in the
funicular.

"They did not have automatic check in?" I asked.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "The instructions said to go
to the desk."

"No one is here," I said.

"Perhaps there is a screen," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded doubtful. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell sounded very tired and a little bit scared. I was tired,
too, and definitely unnerved by the silence. I kept listening, but I
heard only the wind and rain outside. The thunder was intermittent.
That meant the lightning persisted though we could not see it from
inside the lobby.

On the desk stood a sign--a printed sign. It read: RING FOR SERVICE.
Next to the printed sign was a bell. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
reached out and touched the bell. Its pleasant peal filled the lobby
with sound.

"How quaint," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"I have read about such signs and such bells in old terry stories," I
said. "I would not think any terries have ever been here except you."

"I've read that humanoid technology is very much the same from one
race to another," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I wonder if this
bell does anything."

We looked around. The desk was large and made of beautiful wood. We
saw no indication of how we could ascertain our room assignment.
Perhaps we should just claim one. Except for the people Detective
Ronnie Camberwell had come to protect, there probably was not anyone
else here.

The door behind the desk opened and someone came slowly toward the
desk. By its movements, I realized it was a mechanical object--a
robot. I had read about robots, but I had never seen one.

It said, "Welcome to Hotel Vista Incredible. How may I serve you?"

Its voice was understandable but quite gravely.

"I am Ronnie Camberwell," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "This is
my companion Captain Star Runner. We made a reservation."

"I have a record of your reservation, detective," the robot said. "You
and Captain Star Runner have the Mountain View Suite on Level Five.
Please take the lift to that level and proceed to your left. Room
service is available at all times. Please let us know how else we may
serve you."

And with that invitation, the robot reversed and exited the lobby
through the same door behind the desk it had just come through.

For a few seconds Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I stood there in
silence.

"Why did we have to come to the desk for that?" Detective Ronnie
Camberwell asked. "We could have been sent that message."

"I believe we were scanned," I said.

"Scanned? How do you know that?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Through my AI relay," I said. "Did you notice that the robot called
you Detective?"

"Yes," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "So much for my wanting to
operate anonymously."

"You probably still can," I said. "I doubt that robot is much of a
conversationalist."

Captain Star Runner
-------------------

Planet X, Hotel Vista Incredible: evening local time
----------------------------------------------------

We used the lift. We could have gone up the staircase, but our luggage
could not have followed. I have never walked up five flights of
stairs. I will have to try going up and down this staircase before I
leave Hotel Vista Incredible. The staircase is broad with elaborately
carved banisters and newel posts. It rises from the lobby floor two
whole stories until it disappears behind a wall. A long balcony or
gallery runs across the lobby. Rooms on the upper floors open to this
open area.

Our vista suite also opened onto one of these galleries. When we found
the appropriate door, there was no palm lock or scanner. Instead there
was a metal plate with another metal rod sticking out of it. We both
studied this for some time.

"Christabel says this is a key," I announced. "We are to turn it."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell was far more suited to turning the key
with her hand than I was with my paw. I would need to practice the
movement so I could come and go as I pleased.

When we stepped into the spacious main room, we understood why the hotel
was called Hotel Vista Incredible and why this was a Vista Suite. Many
structures of unknown purpose line the unnamed river. 0

"Christabel says, 'It is believed
more structures lie amidst the mountains. The exact date and extent of
these structures is unknown, but archaeologists theorize that the people
who once occupied Planet X built them for their royalty. They also
theorize they once held great treasures, but the treasures are no longer
present.'"

"That sounds like a familiar story," Detective Ronnie Camberwell
commented.

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"People stole the treasure a long time ago," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said. "The only artifacts that are left are those things
they couldn't pack up and move."

"That appears to be correct," Christabel said.

Christabel spoke to us through the mini AI regulator integrated into the
skin just above my collar bone. It regulated my biological systems when
I was away from my ride and contained a very small subset of information
I could access if I found myself beyond Christabel's communication
range. While I was in range, Christabel could use the AI to interface
with my biological systems and exchange data with me. It was sometimes
slow and usually very frustrating, but it allowed me to leave my ride on
such outings as this one.

Lightning flashed brightly, augmenting the flood lights strategically
placed beyond our windows. The opposite wall of the main room was
entirely clear. Beyond it was an open-air balcony. Beyond that was the
view.

The ground fell away steeply to a valley. Across the valley were
mountains--range after range of mountains. We both gasped. It was like
standing in mid air with the river and its valley far below us.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell found literature describing the scene.

"These are the sacred mountains and valley of the Chukquirey,"
Detective Ronnie Camberwell narrated. "Little is known about what the
Chukquirey is--a people, a deity, a belief, a state of being. People
came to the Hotel Vista Incredible to imbibe the chukquirey. By imbibe
they meant drink in or embody the chukquirey."

"You know," I interrupted, "that balcony is not enclosed. It is open
to the elements and there is nothing between that not-too-high balcony
and the river below us."

I am confident in my own abilities not to fall from that railing. I
practice in varying environments, not only 0G, but I know how skiddish
Detective Ronnie Camberwell is around physical dangers like this one.
I doubted she would ever open the balcony door and walk outside. When
it was dry, I was anxious to have a look.

I wanted Detective Ronnie Camberwell to understand our balcony is the
only thing between us and a precipitous drop to the valley floor. The
Hotel Vista Incredible is both breath-taking in its views and very
dangerous.


While I processed our new environment Detective Ronnie Camberwell
stepped into an alcove along one wall.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

"Exploring the kitchen," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I think I
can order us a meal.A"

I checked with Christabel. A meal would be in order.

"Do you have to prepare it?" I asked. This hotel seemed so antiquated
I was beginning to think it had been a mistake to come here.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I just have to figure out the
instructions. Please come here. Perhaps you or Christabel can read
them more clearly than I can. My basic language skills are pretty good
but these are not written by a native speaker."

They certainly were not. Together we puzzled them out, pressed the
appropriate buttons, twists the appropriate knobs and basically
pushed, pulled, twisted and slid controls until hot steaming trays of
food appeared. We ordered too much food or we reordered food we had
already selected. Detective Ronnie Camberwell said there was a way to
preserve the food and reheat it later so we ate as much as we wanted
and stored the rest. Christabel, as usual, tut-tutted about what I
ate. My mini AI was not as well equipped as Christabel was to adjust
my biochemical levels. I felt quite uncomfortable when I was finished
eating. Christabel said my stomach was over filled and I was feeling
stuffed. That was quite a good adjective to describe the feeling. I
promptly curled up on the floor and went to sleep.

Ronnie
------

hotel-vista-incredible-evening-local-time
-----------------------------------------

I watched Captain Star Runner sleep. She has no idea, I think, that I
love to watch her sleep. Star Runner curls herself up into a very
tight circle, her nose in between her paws, her tail tucked alongside
her paws and chin. She makes little snuffling noises. When she dreams,
her paws and ears twitch. Her nose scents the air.

I know Pantherans, Members of the Race, do not like to be referred to
as cats, but sleeping on the rug, Captain Star Runner looked very much
like a cat--a very big cat, but a cat all the same.

I knew I should figure out where my charges were in the building and
check in on them. I just did not have the energy. I am not a good
space traveler. The descent through the atmosphere had been harrowing.
I could feel the spaceship buffeted by the intense winds. The landing
had been bumpy. The landing area was in poor repair. All the
conveyances we had used, the transport to the funicular, the funicular
itself and the transfer to the hotel's portico were all ramshackle.
They lurched, bumped and swayed mercilessly. I was sure throughout the
entire two-hour ride up the mountainside that the train would come
tumbling down the rails and kill us both. I was fearful about
descending the mountain. The ascent had been terrifying.

The meal was excellent. I ate not anything approaching the quantity
that Star Runner ate, but I was just about as content as she was.

I must have drifted off where I sat in one of the overstuffed chairs
near the clear wall overlooking the valley and the mountain ranges
beyond because I jerked awake. Captain Star Runner was on her feet,
all her fur puffed out.

"What?" I asked.

"A scream," Captain Star Runner said. "A human scream if I am not
mistaken."

My stomach clenched. One of my charges, no doubt, and here I was asleep
in a chair after a hearty meal.

I got to my feet.

"I have to go," I said.

"I will come with you," Star Runner said.

"No," I said.

"Yes," she said.

"You can't--" I began.

"Yes, I can protect us," Captain Star Runner said.

There was no point in arguing with her. It would be quicker to just
go.

"I think you will find the room in question on the third level,"
Christabel said through Star Runner's gem.

It seemed as good an idea as any.

I threw open our door and hurried to the staircase. I could take the
steps two at a time with my long legs and hurried along the gallery. I
did not bother to close or lock our door.. If Star Runner thought of
it, she could struggle with the key. I certainly had no interest or
time to fiddle with such an archaic contraption. It might be artful.
It might be quaint. But it was certainly inconvenient and a nuisance.

Star Runner followed behind more slowly. If I had given it any
thought, I knew she would have liked to jump from landing to landing
in a grand gesture of Pantheran agility and skill. Fortunately, the
mini AI backed by Christabel prevailed. Flamboyant gestures can be
well-executed. They can also be foolish and dangerous. Captain Star
Runner was not used to this gravity and had not trained in normal G
situations. Her acrobatics aboard her spaceship were impressive but
they were performed at either 0G or close to it. Her excellent muscle
tone was maintained through Christabel's ministrations. Members of the
Race believed in both healthy bodies and healthy minds. Even so, Star
Runner was well-advised to precede with caution when it came to stairs
designed for humanoids.

Light emerged from underneath one door along the gallery. I ran toward
it. Fortunately, it was unlocked. I threw it open.

This was not one of the vista suites. In fact, it was hardly more than
a closet. A young woman was kneeling alongside a young man. He was not
moving. She was saying a name over and over again. "Heracles."
"Heracles." "Heracles." He was not moving.

"Is he dead?" I asked, still standing in the doorway.

The young woman was startled. She looked up at me with fear.

"I'm Ronnie Camberwell," I said. "Is Heracles dead?"

"I don't know," the young woman said. "I don't know how to tell."

"What happened?" I asked, not moving from the doorway.

"I heard a scream," she said. "I came into the room. He was like
this."

"And you are?" I asked.

"Suri. Suri, Suri Nam."

Well, here were the two people I came here to protect. One of them
might be dead.

"Are you the only ones in the room?" I asked.

"I don't know," he said, looking wildly around. "Do you think there's
someone else here?"

"He screamed for a reason," I said.

I was unarmed. Hotel regulations prohibited weapons. I needed to do a
search.

No one else was in the tiny room. And Heracles was dead.

Captain Star Runner
-------------------

Planet X: Early Morning
----------------------

To keep it simple, I will summarize what happened during the rest of
the evening.

1.  The robot concierge confirmed that the two archiology students,
    Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I were the only ones registered at
    the Hotel Vista Incredible. The robot concierge additionally
    confirmed that we were the only living beings in the hotel.

2.  This left Detective Ronnie Camberwell weighing the possibility that
    Suri Nam had killed Hericles Beja, but after questioning the living
    archiology student, Detective Ronnie Camberwell believed her when she
    said she had not killed Heracles Beja. What reason, she asked reasonably,
    would she have to kill him. They had worked together for two standard
    years on their project. They were both concerned what their impact
    their findings would have on the archiological community in the
    Primary Zone and had reached out for protection. They did not stand
    to profit either academically or financially from their research and
    their conclusions, so she would have no reason to eliminate a
    potential competitor.

3. The robot concierge also confirmed that no one else had come to the
    Hotel Vista Incredible during the last two standard years.

4.  The robot concierge removed Heracles Beja's body. It said it would be
    reserved indefinitely.
	
5.  Detective Ronnie Camberwell decided Suri Nam shold move into
    our Vista Incredible suite. I could take up a guard position by the
    door to the gallery. To my way of thinking, this also meant that I
    was between Detective Ronnie Camberwell's sleeping chamber (That is
    what the Hotel Vista Incredible called it.) and Suri Nam. I did
    not trust her as the exchange which follows shows.

    "Suri Nam had to have killed Heracles Beja," I told Detective
    Ronnie Camberwell early the next morning. "She is the only one
    that could have done it."

"But it makes no sense for her to do that," Detective Ronnie
:   Camberwell insisted.

"If you eliminate the impossible," I quoted, "Then you are left
:   with the truth no matter how improbable it may seem." I was very
    proud to produce this quotation from Sherlock Holmes at the proper
    time.

"That's fiction, Star. I believe Suri. There has to be something I'm
missing here. Heracles screamed. Something frightened him before he died."

"Or Heracles Beja was in pain."

I was pleased with myself for my contribution. I was convinced Suri
Nam was the killer from the time I saw her kneeling over Heracles
Beja's body. I did not know what her motivation was. It just was the
simplest explanation possible. That is Occam's razor. I had read about
that, too. I could not understand why Detective Ronnie Camberwell
could not see it.

Usually it is I who goes off believing things to be different than
they really are. I have made many mistakes of this kind though I have
ironclad explanations for why I was so badly misled in the first
place.
yes

"I still do not like it," I said.

"That is your prerogative." Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

I had to leave it there.

Captain Star Runner
-------------------

Planet X: Later That Same Morning
---------------------------------

Suri Nam was adamant that we visit a particular ancient structure on
the valley floor. I was not eager to repeat our descent down the
mountain. Suri Nam said we would not take the funicular. There was a
maglif tram.

What she did not tell us was how we were to get to the tram.

A large basket lowered us down the sheer face of the cliff on which
Hotel Vista Incredible perched. My only comfort was knowing that if
one of the cables snapped, Suri Nam would also be killed. As a Member
of the Race, I am not bothered by heights and my genetic engineering
makes me indifferent to orientations in weightless environments.
Detective Ronnie Camberwell, on the other hand, clung desperately onto
the provided poles, huddling her large body on the floor as she did
so. Detective Ronnie Camberwell closed her eyes. So much for providing
protection during the long drop. As a result, she missed the magnificent
vistas. I believe the Hotel Vista Incredible literature called these
views bird's eye and referred to them as spellbinding. I would not
know. I have nothing to compare them to.

After The Drop, we boarded a tram. For a long time we switchbacked up
and down the mountainsides until we reached a depot on the valley
floor.

incredible. With no other living beings planet side, all this
equipment continued to be maintained. Suri Nam selected a wheeled
vehicle and we bounced along a roadway Suri Nam referred to as the
River Walk. I did not comment on the strangeness of riding in a
vehicle on a road called a walk.

"Do you see those mounds along the river?" Suri Nam asked, waving her
arm at no particular mound but taking in all of the area we passed.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell replied in the affirmative.

"Heracles and I investigated a number of them. We believe there was a
raised walkway along the river. Pedestrians could go into many
structures along the way."

"Are they  houses?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Possibly. We thought they might bee eating establishments or other
facilities that attended to travelers. We think the structures I am
taking you to may have been for worship. Pilgrims came here and needed
food, rest and recreation."

"What about the Hotel Vista Incredible?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell
asked.

"That may have been for more affluent visitors," Suri Nam said as she
swerved violently to avoid a pothole.

"But your room was tiny," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"Agreed. Yours is much nicer. However, the People who stayed in those
cubbyholes could use the hotel's facilities and they only had to go to
the observation lounges to see the views. That's a small price to pay
for those views. Heracles and I speculated that there was some value
in the views themselves. Perhaps just looking out at the views
enhanced your virtue or gave you some special spiritual insights."

"Or maybe," I put in, "just having the gumption to go up that mountain
gave you spiritual credits."

"Could be." Suri Nam sounded noncommittal. Perhaps our remarks did not fit into Suri Nam's vision and thereby
was discounted. Suri Nam definitely liked to be in charge and now
there was no one to dispute with her opinions. I wondered how long it
would be before *Heracles and I* was replaced with *I*.

Come to think of it, I noticed then and reflected on it often later, she showed no regret or disquiettude concerning Heracles BeBeja's death. This did not count in Suri Nam's favor as far as I was concerned.

We stepped inside one of the stone structures on the other side of the
avenue from the slowly flowing river. It was cool and dark and smelled
occupied.

"This is where Heracles and I have been working," Suri Nam explained,
lighting the interior.

The room had a vaulted ceiling. The doorways leading from it were both
high and wide like the one we had entered.

"We speculate the people who built these structures were larger than
we are." Suri Nam continued her explanation. "It is commonly held that
these structures were some sort of religious shrines, possibly for the
dead or they were concerned with an after life. Other structures have
vast murals in very poor condition so we can't fully follow the story
line."

"All this has been documented for some time," I said, pulling
information from my mini AI which was being updated constantly by
Christabel. Christabel had been able to patch into communication
satellites that ringed the planet. Why Planet X had such a
sophisticated and state-of-the-art communication arrays was a mystery
to both of us. There was something going on here that was not obvious.

Suri Nam gave me a pitying look.

"That is what is said officially."

I waited for Suri Nam to enlighten us while Detective Ronnie
Camberwell kept looking around as if the explanation would walk
through one of the doorways.

"I made extensive tests of the paint on these figures." Suri Nam
pointed to a long line of figures walking along the avenue. They
looked very familiar to me but I could not quite remember. That is the
problem with the mini AI. It has tables of memories stored back on my
ride. I need to send a request to Christabel to access them and send
them back. There is a bit of a delay in this process. I am just
grateful it works at all. Without this methodology of retrieving my
memories, I would be knowing I knew something without actually knowing
it.

Then Christabel got back to me. The figures in the mural were
trollolu, a race that had not existed for twenty thousand years.

I marveled that Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not recognize the
reptilian race. We had seen pictures of them in the Prince Hat Star
System where my dear friend Tamara had been working on an
archaeological dig. In our adventure which I chronicled in *Landscape
of Thorns*, we learned the Trollolu were an ancient, now extinct, race
who had trained the Members of the Race, The Featherote Charm and the
Fungusian Network. They had been annihilated by a race which called
itself Followers of the Stars. The Followers of the Stasr were
contemporaries of the Empire of the Rainbow Sky, one of the oldest
races here in the Primary Arm. The Trollolu and the Followers of the
Stars lived in the spiral where both Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I
came from.

Bottom line: What were pictures of the Trollolu doing in this
structure?

Christabel cautioned me not to say anything. With a murderer in our
midst, knowledge could sign our death warrants. I kept silent. This is
something I am not usually good at, but protecting my own life and
that of Detective Ronnie Camberwell is genetically encoded in me. A
star runner is responsible for its crew when no other Member of the
Race is present.

I directed Christabel to block my ability to discuss the Trollolus
with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. This is a handy technique for
keeping confidential information secret. Genderless Members of the
Race make very good spies and couriers. The interrogator would have to
have the skills to redirect the AI. Built into the algorithm are the
directives for the AI to break the embargo on its own.

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

This circumstance will result in Ronnie not having a piece of critical
information later when she needs it. Christabel fails to recognize
Ronnie's need for it, too. This will reinforce Ronnie's distrust of
Christabel's attitude toward her. This in turn will upset Captain Star
Runner. it is not clear to me at this juncture whether I need to resolve
this ongoing triangle to some state of equilibrium before the end of the
novel.

</div>

i BECAME SO INVOLVED LOOKING AT THE trollolu THAT i FORGOT TO KEEP MY
ATTENTION FOCUSED ON detective Ronnie camber Bell and Suri Nam. When I
refocused on them, I saw their heads close together while Suri Nam
continued to talk with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Their body
language had changed. I am still no expert at reading humanoid body
language, but it was clear to me that both women enjoyed the close
contact. Instinctively I puffed up. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was my
lover. How dare this interloper take liberties with Detective Ronnie
Camberwell.

But as I watched and listened, my body regained its
natural dimensions and I felt as if it pulled into itself. Christabel at work, both putting my reactions on an even kiil and protecting me and therefore Detective Ronnie Camberwell from Suri Nam noticing my instinctive behavior. I may be a genderless Pantheran, but I still have strong feelings about what I judge to be mine and my own best interests.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell liked Suri Nam's attentions and was
drawing closer to her. Unlike the humanoids, I could smell the
fenestration in the that each emitted. Suri Nam was not faking her
attraction to Detective Ronnie Camberwell. It was real.

I literally sat back on my haunches. This meant, if I understood
gendered humanoid interactions well enough, that any objection I would
raise to Detective Ronnie Camberwell about Suri Nam would be brushed
away categorically.

Now I had three problems on my paws:

1.  Suri Nam is a murderer. Murderers find it easy to kill again.

2.  Detective Ronnie Camberwell is attracted to Suri Nam. Thus far,
    although Detective Ronnie Camberwell finds humanoid females
    attractive and often engages in sexual activities with them, she
    finds it impossible to fully bond with them. Detective Ronnie
    Camberwell always comes back to me. But would she do that this
    time? Could I stop Suri Nam from both steeling my lover and
    killing her in time?
	
3.  How should I proceed? If I understand the course of humanoid
    attraction, I will increasingly be an inconvenience. More and more
    the two women would want to spend time alone. What should I do?

Christabel remained silent. This is a bit surprising. Even after
thinking this thought, Christabel does not comment. I can solicit her
input, of course, but I can also think about it by myself. The
relationship between Christabel and Detective Ronnie Camberwell is
complicated and often contentious. Christabel wants to integrate
Detective Ronnie Camberwell's thoughts into Christabel's dataset.
Detective Ronnie Camberwell objects strongly to this integration,
wanting to keep her thoughts and feelings quite separate.

Not for the first time I wonder if this integration disturbs Detective
Ronnie Camberwell because we are not species compatible. I can exist
because Christabel exists, that is, I am connected to an AI which
maintains my mental, physical and emotional health. I literally cannot
stay alive if I was not connected to an AI to sustain me. I cannot
imagine living without an AI in my head. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
cannot imagine living with one inside her head.

We manage to function as a couple for long periods of time and then it
all falls apart. This has happened several times. We get together
again after each episode, but sitting in the stone structure on Planet
X, I wondered how many times we could play out that scenario before we
finally could not come together again. Would it be this time? Would it
be our decision or would Suri Nam make that decision for us?

"What do you want to do?" Christabel finally spoke.

"What do you mean?" I had been so immersed in my own thoughts that
Christabel startled me. That is hard to do.

"How do you want to proceed with Detective Ronnie Camberwell?"

"I do not understand the question," I finally said.

"You have options in any relationship. You could:

1.  Resist Suri Nam's advances toward Detective Ronnie Camberwell
    either directly or indirectly.

2.  Walk away literally or figuratively from them. You could wait aboard the ride until Detective Ronnie Camberwell is ready to leave.

You are a free agent here, Star Runner. You can do what you think is
right for you."

"So it is flight or fight," I said.

"More or less," Christabel agreed. "How much do you want Detective
Ronnie Camberwell to be your monogamous lover? You could keep her as a
friend. You could look after her well-being. Tamara is your friend and
is not your lover. The Czarina is your friend and not your lover."

I knew the list of former lovers could go on. Whether all of them were
still my friends is another question. Right now my focus was on
monogamy. If I am telling the truth here, and I try to tell the truth
in these adventures, I have not always been monogamous. Space journeys
are long. Detective Ronnie Camberwell has often objected to my
pornographic database for other genderless Members of the Race. It is
typically a subscription plan. We can sample scenarios that get played
out in our minds with hooks into our AIs for the physical components.
I make frequent use of it myself as well as playing out private
recordings of my interactions with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. She
finds these solitary reenactments creepy. This is because they are
stored in memory where Christabel is a part of them. I have pointed
out to Detective Ronnie Camberwell many times that there would be no
lovemaking at all if it were not for Christabel managing my pleasure
at what Detective Ronnie Camberwell was doing or pretending to do with
my body. I have no physical pleasure centers. It is all controlled via
my AI.

"I am the only AI Detective Ronnie Camberwell has ever known,"
Christabel observed. "I think it could be different if Detective
Ronnie Camberwell did not think of me as a person but as a computer
program without any personality."

I did not respond to this observation. I continued to watch and
therefore record the interaction of the two women. I also continued to
puzzle over the appearance of the Trollolu in the mural. I wondered
what other races I would find in other murals on other walls in other
structures. I determined to have a look at them if at all possible.
This would limit my ability to watch over Detective Ronnie Camberwell
if Suri Nam and Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not want to accompany
me.

"We need that information," Christabel announced. "I suspect that you
can suggest it and if they think you are not watching them too
closely, it will be a cover for them to continue to spend time
together without, they think, being too noticeable. Both races of
humanoid value monogamy. They may well see their growing relationship
as illicit."

I hoped so. This would mean Detective Ronnie Camberwell had not ended
our relationship.

"It is also dangerous," Christabel chided me. "illicit relationships
are conducted in secret. The need for obfuscation grows. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell may start lying to you to cover her time and
activities with Suri Nam. You need to be prepared for this."

This really meant Christabel would be stepping up her boo management.
I needed to make some decisions about how Christabel did this. If I
gave my AI no instructions, her directives remained to keep me in top
physical, mental and emotional health. This could even mean
reorganizing my memories. I could lose my desire to be in a
relationship with Detective Ronnie Camberwell if Christabel thought it
would be a healthier option for me.

My confusion at this juncture made it impossible for me to modify
those directives.

Recovered System Log by Fungusian Network: Date hidden
------------------------------------------------------

Captain Star Runner's ambivalence here will have an impact from this
point forward on its decision-making process. Captain Star Runner has
failed to give Christabel a definitive instruction to maintain its
desire to stay committed to Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Christabel's
overriding directive is the health and well-being of her charge. Given
the enhancements the People of the Rainbow Sky did to their systems in
*Sanctuary*, their bond has been strengthened and Christabel is more
protective than ever. No attempt was made in the upgrade and the
maintenance done by the Fungusian network to give Christabel any
understanding of the nature of a paired relationship. Any ongoing
relationship with its ups and downs threatens Captain Star Runner's
equilibrium and therefore requires Christabel to make corrections and
interventions.

Captain Star Runner
-------------------

Planet X: Continued
-------------------

I refocused on the women's conversation.

"The accepted historical arc is that a race of humanoids controlled
this planet," Suri Nam was saying, "and built these structures and
everything you can see along the River Walk. They were advanced. We
can see that in the hotel and with their communications systems."

"Where are they now?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"They left for some reason." Suri Nam did not seem overly interested
in the question. "What my research shows is that they weren't the
first people on this planet." She pointed to the Trollolu. "These must
have been the original people here on the planet who built these
structures."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell looked at the blurred representations of
the Trollolu. Apparently she did not recognize them. Christabel
advised me that she had superimposed all of the figure outlines to
demonstrate that what these individual paintings had originally shown
were a line of Trollolu. I studied the mural again. What was happening
here?

"I've never seen anything like these people," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell was saying. "They look ugly to me."

In a superior tone Suri Nam said, "They don't appear to be humanoid.
I suppose that is why you think hey are ugly. For all we know, this
might have been a beauty pageant."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell shook her head. Then she turned to me.

"Captain Star Runner, what do you think?"

What could I say? I had stopped Christabel from allowing me to
say,"Those are Trollolu. Do not you recognize them?" But there was
something I could say, was not there?

"Are there any other kind of figures?" I asked. It was always better
to answer a question with a question.

"Why would there be any other kind of figures?" Suri Nam dismissed my
question out of hand as if I was particularly stupid.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell, on the other hand, took my question
seriously. "What do you mean, other figures, Captain Star Runner?"

The use of my honorific could mean two entirely different things:

1.  Detective Ronnie Camberwell was distancing herself from me and
    being more formal.
	
2.  Detective Ronnie Camberwell had heard Suri Nam's slight and was
    reminding Suri Nam that I was not some stupid animal but an
    intelligent and competent alien.

I said, "There are many races in the Primary Zone. I just wondered who
else these aliens might have known."

Although she was an archaeologist, Suri Nam demonstrated her narrowest
of vision with her next observation. "The Empire of the People of the
Rainbow Sky and the Lystran Empire are the oldest races. No doubt
these were some aliens from long ago. It really doesn't matter. What
matters is the age of this structure. It must have been built by
either empire. I intend to find out which."

The Trollolu were an ancient people. The Followers of the Stars were
an even more ancient people. The Members of the Race, the Fungusian
Network and the Featherote Charm are also ancient. Terries are a
fairly new race. The Rabbit People and those who came from the planet
where I was incarcerated in Sanctuary XI are recent races. I did not
know the proveniences of the races that made up the Space Traders
Guild. All these different people and Suri Nam could only think of two
possibilities.

I checked my records. Yes, Suri Nam was Lystran. I suspected her final
determination would have a lot to do with whether or not she wanted to
claim these structures as part of her own heritage or not. The fact
that they had been abandoned might mitigate against her claiming them.

The question for me in this matter was, Who maintained this planet?
That might go along way to answering all the questions about who
really built this place and why there was a cover up.

Notes to the Reader
-------------------

I am a professional. I have worked on a police force. I have been a
private investigator. I have been working as an assistant to an
enforcer. I know my job.

The most important rule of my job is not to get personally
involved. It distorts your view and compromises your integrity in so
many ways.

When I saw Suri Nam kneeling next to the body of Heracles Beja, I lost
my professionalism. I lost my ability to be objective. Suri Nam took
my breath away. I was immediately smitten. I did not want to be
attracted to a client. I did not want to be enamored of anyone else
besides Captain Star Runner, my own true love. Yet I was bewitched. I
cannot give any other explanation for my behavior. I have no defense
for what happened and no excuses for my behavior.

Suri Nam was everything I physically desire in a woman:

-   fragile-looking

-   small wrists

-   slender

-   dark-haired

-   long straight hair worn loose.


As a Lystran, she wore long skirts and a high-necked, long-sleeved
over shirt. These garments hid the outline of her body. My imagination
filled in a tiny waist and rounded hips. Her nose and chin were a bit
pointy for my human taste, but those points are highly desired in
Lystran society. The average individual has a very broad
face. Heracles Beja had a broad face.

"I think he is dead," were the first words I heard Suri Nam speak.
She spoke the basic spacer language with a soft voice and some accent
which sounded exotic to my ears.

I knew my space basic was very accented. Jack Whicher said it made me
sound very formidable. With my large hands and feet, my large and
awkward body this gave me what I thought of as a brutish demeanor. I
compensate by being in good physical condition. Although Captain Star
Runner will call me beautiful, I think of myself as very plain with
good skin and a direct gaze. My mouth is too big for my face.

As I looked at her, I could not imagine Suri Nam killing Heracles
Beja. How I could have continued to believe in her innocence still
baffles me. Captain Star Runner was right. Who else could have killed
him? Suri Nam was the only other living being on the planet who could
have done it. Captain Star Runner had not killed him. I had not killed
him. The robot concierge could not have killed him. Why did I continue
to believe in some unknown other killer?

It has to do with my reason for being on Planet X in the first
place. I have not said much about this until now. The background on
the contract may explain a little why I was willing to believe in Suri
Nam's innocence for so long.

I think it is best for me to give you some background information at this juncture. I haven't chronacled my work at Half Moon Bay Space Station. My work there was routine and doesn't merit a book of this length. Like many kinds of work,nothing especially interesting happened day to day.

Only people who have a connection to those who founded the Space Traders
Guild are allowed to participate in the governance of the space station.
Half Moon Bay Space Station is huge. There are a number of pods, each of
which has its own local authority. The space guilders take turns
governing. Each local authority sends representatives to the Space
Station Council. Because very few Space Guilders have the luxury of
giving all their time to carrying out their governmental duties, they
hire non-Space Guilders like Jack Whicher and me to perform such
functions as sanitation, pod maintenance, revenue collection and
education. They reserve defense for themselves though they can and do
hire mercenaries as needed.

Jack Whicher is an enforcer. He collects overdue revenues. I work for
him. Although the title sounds as if we physically threaten people, this
is usually unnecessary and is frowned upon by the Space Station Council.
We have the authority to incarcerate and to impound. It is a job that
mostly requires being tough most of the time and figuring out how to
obtain payment. Jack Whicher has a reputation of being fair. This helps
a lot.

From time to time, we get requests for other policing tasks. I usually
take these on since my background gives me the skill set for
investigation. Mostly I deal with thievery though occasionally there is
a threat of physical violence.

One day when I reported for work, Jack waved me over to his display.

"What do you think of this?" he asked, pointing at the message.

I saw from his hand held that the message had been translated from
Lystran.

"I thought the Guilders didn't do business with the Lystrans," I said.

"Guilders do business with anybody," Jack said. "They are traders. That
is why your Captain Star Runner gets on with them so well. They are all
pirates at heart."

"But isn't there a war going on?"

"Oh, yeah, there are some skirmishes. Lystra thinks it is still an
empire. It's trying to flex its muscles, but it's so old and sick it can
barely get out of its own way. The People of the Golden Sun have made
inroads, and the People of the Rainbow Sky have tried to get back the
territories--it's just an excuse for flashy spaceships and a lot of
saber rattling. It's quite localized and has no effect on us."

That was not what Christabel had told me, but I am always disinclined to
trust everything Christabel says. I know she is an artificial
intelligence, but I am convinced she is biased and often is biased
against me.

Christabel had said it was a serious conflict In her scanning of many
news outlets and some back channel conversations, a real power struggle
was underway. It could change the politics in  the Primary
Zone for many years to come. Christabel believed several races would
divide Lystra up and depending on how that shook out, free trade might
be compromised. This was of great interest to the Space Traders Guild
and they were having back channel conversations with all the major
players and a number of minor ones as well. There had been equilibrium
in the Primary Arm for many millenia. The deterioration of the Lystran
Empire and the emergence of the radical People of the Golden Sun was
changing the balance of power. No one knew if the old Empire of the
Rainbow Sky had enough power any more to settle the dispute
definitively.

I did not have an opinion. I was here at Half Moon Bay Space Station
because Captain Star Runner was here. Both of us were de facto exiles from
the Spiral. We hoped that staying here for a while might make
it possible for us to return some day.

I read what Jack was showing me.

"Let me get this straight. Someone from Lystra has contacted you to
protect two archeology students on some deserted planet?"

"Not just any deserted planet, Ronnie. We're talking about Planet X."

"Is it really called Planet X"

"I'm sure it has a name, but everyone calls it Planet X. It's haunted.
Perhaps treasure is buried there. No one knows. No one goes
there. It's bad luck to go there."

"So why did these students go there and why do they need protection
from ghosts?"

"That's not the point, Ronnie." Jack wiggled his fingers. "This is an
official request for assistance and it comes with a sizable payment
from one of the student's family. I did a little checking. They're an
old family, down on their luck a bit as is the whole Lystran Empire,
but they're legitimate. Their daughter is legitimate. There is some
story about special research and fear of academic reprisals. It should
be a piece of cake. Just go there as if it is a holiday. You can make
a bundle which ought to make your cat friend happy."

I had never told Jack Captain Star Runner and I are lovers. He is a
bit prudish when it comes to that kind of interspecies relationships.

"I thought you said no one goes to Planet X."

"Oh, there's a fancy hotel. It's a dare some people take. People will
think you're adventurous if you go there. It's a bit --" he waved his
hand not finding the right expression. "It will give you some
cashette."

The contract was generous indeed. The payment would be all mine if I
went. I would have to compensate Captain Star Runner in some way, sell
her on the idea. She did not like it that it was all secret until I
safely removed my charges from Planet X, but the thought of having me
on board with her pleased Captain Star Runner very much.

But here I was, standing in the doorway of an ancient building on a
haunted world where both my charges were and one of them was
dead. Fortunately, it was the male. My contract was with the female's
family. No romantic involvement had been referred to.

My snap decision, based on what I thought of at the time was an
objective viewpoint, was to protect Suri Nam and earn my fee. What I
should have done was walk away and forfeit the fee. Captain Star
Runner and I should have gone back to Half Moon Bay Space Station and
forgotten there ever was a contract and forgotten that Planet X even
exists. Maybe we even should have gone back to the Spiral and the
Northern Frontier.

But that is not what happened.

Ronnie

Planet X: Midday
----------------

So there I was, standing next to Suri Nam, wishing Captain Star Runner
would leave the building so I could hold Suri Nam in my arms and run
my hands all over her. I was quivering all over, or at least that is
what I felt like. Star was acting strangely. She was somehow distant
but also judgmental, an Erie combination. I felt she was hovering, not
allowing me to do my job. Her opinion that Suri had killed Heracles
was simply outrageous and one of the irritating erroneous judgments
about humanoids Star is often prone to make. I should suggest she return to Christabel and the ride.

The figures on the wall fascinated me. I never saw their resemblance
to the Trollolu holograms I had seen in the Prince Hat Star
System. What impressed me here was the detail of the surviving pieces
of the mural.  After all this time, the artwork was still
breathtaking. What must these figures on the wall looked like when
they were freshly drawn?

"Are there more figures like this anywhere else?" I asked. I was
trying to think of something intelligent to say. I did not want Suri
to think I was just big muscle. I wanted her to think I was someone
she could treat as an equal, someone she wanted to be with. I wondered
if she could possibly be attracted to me. I hoped she was but I could
not tell. If only Star would pad outside, I could take the risk of
touching her.

"I do not know," Suri said. She sounded disinterested. "I had to run
many tests on this mural. When I made the discovery about its extreme
age, I had to document everything in great detail so I can publish
it."

"What do you think it means?" I asked, trying to sound spellbound. I
do not do overawed well.

"I think it means the Empire of the Rainbow Sky has been lying for
millenia," Suri Nam said. "When I release this information, the whole
Primary Zone will know how underhanded they are."

The political implications of this discovery had not occurred to me.
What should have occurred to me was that Lystra was an old enemy of
the People of the Rainbow Sky. I did not know much about either of
them.  Captain Star Runner was positively disposed toward the Empire
of the Rainbow Sky. Perhaps that was why she was so skeptical of
Suri. I could not recall all the details of Star's interaction with
the People of the Rainbow Sky. I suspected Star had not told the whole
story to me. Star often left bits out, always casting herself as the
heroine of her adventures. I know these people had done something to
Star. She was just a bit different when she returned. I wondered now
if it was some sort of mind control, something that both Star Runner
and Christabel were imprisoned by. That must be why Star Runner was so
adamant that Suri must have killed Heracles.

Now that I had an explanation for Star's behavior, I must guard against being entrapped by the same skewed thinking.

If only I had heard Suri switch from "We" to "I".

Captain Star Runner
-------------------

I heard Suri Name drop the pretense that she and Heracles Beja
continued to be a team in their research. Now it is her
project. Heracles Beja will be lucky even to receive a postumous
acknowledgement.

There were some living quarters nearby the old structures. Suri Nam
had not told us we were staying down in the valley overnight. There was
a rough sort of dinner. Detective Ronnie Camberwell put and Suri Nam
put their clothes in the refresher. They wore loose garments stored in
the facility for just this purpose.

After they were asleep I decided to go exploring. I could not judge how
safe Detective Ronnie Camberwell was. I hoped both women would just
sleep while I was out prowling.

Our old stories say that Members of the Race hunted at dusk and dawn. We
see very well then. We are also creatures of the night. Although I am
born and bred to be in space, I find adjusting to planet night is not
all that difficult. I have all the instinctual moves for stalking and
skulking. I just do not do it with finesse.

I first went to the structure we had previously entered. I wanted to
know what lay behind those doorways. Sadly, the corridors were clogged
with debris. I wondered if Suri Nam and Heracles Beja were required
to remove a substantial amount of debris before they could enter the
structure. If that were the case, I could not reconnoiter other
structures.

I worked my way along the avenue, retracing our route from the tram
roundhouse. Doorways were blocked. Roofs were caved in. The building
Heracles Beja and Suri Nam focused on was the first open one and the
dormitory was nearby.

I checked back there. Both women were sound asleep. I continued
searching along the avenue.

I was about to give up and return to the dormitory when I could
finally stand inside a structure.

I looked about the room. It appeared to be identical to the one Suri
Nam and Heracles Beja had tested in shape. The same number of
doorways led from the entrance room.

Little light came into the room. I removed my torch from my foreleg
pouch and switched it on. Set on its lowest illumination setting, I
swept the room. my torch picked up colors on the wall. Slowly I
increased the illumination until I could get a clear scan.

I did not need for Christabel to interpret what I saw. I recognize
Members of the Race when I see them. This mural was in much better
condition than the Trollolu mural. Suri Nam and Heracles had not
chosen wisely.

During the day, Suri Nam ran tests. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
stayed close to her, hanging on every word, every look. I napped nearby.

I went out every evening, checking more structures. I found a mural of
the Featherote and several containing figures neither Christabel nor I
could identify. I played the ones in good condition over and over again
in my visual display. What did they represent? Why was there a different
mural in each structure? What were these structures for?

I have never understood my best friend Tamara's fascination for
archeology. Tamara goes to places where she works physically hard in
difficult conditions. Tamara says it is because the past intrigues her.
She says there is so much history we have lost. Tamara wants to reclaim
that history. It would seem there is a lot of history that has been lost
here, too. I wonder if it is important. I didn't think so. How wrong I was.

On the last evening in the valley, Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
waiting outside of the dormitory when I returned.

"Where were you?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Prowling around," I said. I did not feel much like answering
Detective Ronnie Camberwell. She had basically ignored me since we
arrived on Planet X. I thought we had agreed that this was supposed to
be an opportunity when we would spend time together. I said as much.

"You are confusing our cover story with my job," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.

"You seem to be infatuated with Suri Nam," I said.

"I need to stay with her. Someone murdered her partner."

"Probably Suri Nam herself." I said.

"Let's not get into that again. I told you. She couldn't have done
it."

We stood facing each other in a tense silence. I wonder now if I
should have told Detective Ronnie Camberwell how important she was to
me. Maybe I should have embraced her, kissed her, twisted myself
around her. I did none of these things. Part of my genderless
engineering causes me to reflexively defer to a gendered being. I have
to consciously work to overcome that preprogrammed behavior. I can do
it readily in business negotiations. I am far less likely to do it in
personal interactions. I am no good at it at all in romantic
settings. I have no instincts at all in this regard. They have been
removed.

The genetic engineers meant this to be a mercy. Genderless Members of
the Race have no sexual attractions to other Members of the Race. We
do not physically desire anyone else. As a result, I was not
predisposed to fight for my position as Detective Ronnie Camberwell's
lover. I simply acquiesced, but I felt her rejection intensely.

"Five more days until the spaceship comes," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell finally said.

"What spaceship?" I asked.

"The one that is scheduled to pick them up and return them to school I
suppose."

Good. Detective Ronnie Camberwell would not pursue her questions about
where I had been. I did not want to share my still nebulous ideas
about this place.

I said, "I am going to prowl around just a little bit more."

I started to walk away.

"Can I come with you?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

My heart started beating a little faster. Maybe Detective Ronnie
Camberwell wanted to be with me after all.

Then Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "I just can't sleep tonight."

Keeping my dejection to myself, I said, "I will need to go back to my
ride soon."

"Why? You're not leaving, are you? You're are my ride back to Half
Moon Bay Space Station."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded a bit panicked.

"No," i said. "The mini AI can only maintain my bio-systems for so
long.  I need Christabel to realign everything."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "Then you'll come back."

"Yes," I said, "if you want me to."

"Of course I want you to."

I became filled with joy.

"I don't want to be marooned here on this planet. It gives me the
creeps. Besides, the contract states I need to see Suri onto the
spaceship and then I'm free to leave. Passage on the spaceship is not
included in the contract."

Just as quickly I felt very disappointed. I was only the backup plan.

We walked more in silence.

"Is there something wrong, Star?"

The question was absurd. I did not laugh. Members of the Race rarely
laugh. Terries think my laugh is quite hilarious.

"No," I said. "There is nothing wrong."

We walked a little farther.

"I'm getting cold," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I think I'll go
back."

We had just passed a structure which looked fairly in tact.

"I want to stop here and look inside," I said.

"If you wish. I'll start back," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

Should I have asked her to look inside with me? Would that have
changed anything? I do not know. Perhaps. Perhaps not.

The structure was almost perfect. A few stones had fallen from the
ceiling. I played my torch over the mural. And there they were:
figures that looked just like Prince Hat. According to the Terries,
these beings looked like great white bears. They were quite big. They
were the race that had fostered the growth of the Featherote, the
Fungusians, the Members of the Race and, yes, the
Trollolu. Apparently, they had fostered other unfamiliar races. I saw
them in this mural walking with all the figures I had seen before in
all the other structures. I walked through one of the doorways. My
torchlight picked out shiny circles and squares. They reminded me of
the crystals that contained lectures by the Trollolu. I had the DNA to
unlock those. Touching these did nothing.  They either were not the
same or they did not respond to my touch. If they were the same sort
of device, these structures might have been schools or museums or some
other place for recording information or teaching it. Maybe this was a
library.

Feeling I had accomplished something, I returned to the dormitory. If
Detective Ronnie Camberwell was awake, she did not say anything.

Ronnie
------

I heard Star come back. I did not call out to her. I wanted toreach
out to her, to ditch my feelings for Suri Nam, but I felt powerless to
do so. Star radiated disapproval and I found her judgment impossible
to breech. It was so much easier to fall for young, attractive,
energetic, driven Suri Nam. I did not think she was as young as she
pretended to be. She had a history and I wanted to know what it was. I
should have asked Christabel to research her. My own stubbornness had
prevented me from doing so.

As I write this, it seems so clear in retrospect, but it wasn't so
clear cut in that stone structure on Planet X.

If only
Captain Star Runner had protested, made a stand or given me an
ultimatum I would have been able to resist Suri
Nam's appeal. Who am I kidding? I know it is not possible for Captain Star
Runner to make such a strong personal declaration.I cannot blame her
for what happened. I am responsible for my own actions as shameful as
they are.

Planet X: Aboard My Ride
------------------------

Although time consuming, getting back to my ride and Christabel was
straight forward. I made a mental note to confer with the robot
concierge on my return. I wondered if the robot concierge could give
me more information about the Valley of the Incredible Vista River if
I asked direct questions. Maybe if I even asked, "Who built this
place?" I might get an answer. I did not want to stop and ask my
questions because it was becoming increasingly clear to me my
bio-systems were degrading rapidly. I had barely enough strength to
make it down the mountainside in the funicular. Christabel sent one of
the stevedore robots to collect me at the funicular railway
station. It was humiliating to be carried in this manner but since no
one was around, I submitted as gracefully as I could manage to the
indignity of it all. With a gasp I lay on my command pedestal and let
the swirling fuchsia mists of connection and healing envelop me. I
slept.

When I awakened, much refreshed and feeling finally like myself again,
I began reviewing all the data Christabel had assembled. There was
quite a lot of it.

Christabel had organized all the data I recorded in the mini AI.
Christabel enhanced my recordings from the stone
structures. Christabel agreed with my quick analysis as to the subject
of the murals.

Christabel had access to a great wealth of ancient Fungusian records.
Most of these were marked unreliable. The Fungusian Network had
included them in Christabel's data stores because of my encounters
with both the White Bear Union and the People of the Rainbow
Sky. Since these were very old races, the Fungusian Network thought
their ancient records might be helpful and there might be an
opportunity to correct them and distinguish between truth, rumor and
myth.

"It appears," Christabel said, "that you have identified one more race
from the ancient archives."

Christabel showed me my video of one of the murals.

"As the other races you identified are real;--the Trollolu, the
featherote, the Fungusian Network and the Members of the Race--I can
only infer that this new race is real also."

I waited for Christabel to explain.Christabel retrieved the data ordered
in a way I could quickly absorb it. All the data was now part of my
memory structure.

Because I share mind space with Christabel, memory structure is very
important. I need to just know information. Christabel downgrades a
series of memories and upgrades others. When these memories are no
longer needed for immediate recall, they are downgraded again. I do
not need an elaborate memory palace to retrieve this information in
its correct order and detail. Christabel does all that work for me.

"These are the Tigerfu," Christabel began. Her narration flowed through
my mind as the video passed across my visual display. Ride status and my
bio readings also were updated vertically at the edges of my vision.

"As you can see, the Tigerfu bear a slight resemblance to the Members of
the Race, that is, they appear slightly feline. The resemblance,
however, is entirely superficial and most strongly in the facial
features. The Tigerfu have erect immobile ears and whiskers. The shape of the
muzzle is similar though theirs are almost flat against the rest of
their faces. Unlike Members of the Race, Tigerfu have two
sets of arms and one set of legs. One set of arms and their legs have paws while the
other set of arms has hands similar to those of humanoids. Their bodies are 
covered by hair which keeps them warm. The stripes are colorations of the hair and vary from
individual to individual. They have vestigial tails. These tails seem to
no longer have any purpose for balance. They do seem to play a part in
courtship and sexual foreplay. I can show you several very grainy videos
of female Tigerfu dancing and wiggling their tails. From the male
audience response, it appears this behavior arouses them. From catcalls
and rude language in my files, touching and biting tails during foreplay
increases arousal."

I added a note to a file to review these videos for my pornographic
database. They could make a tidy sum. I also wanted to explore these
possibilities for my own pleasure. Christabel said there were examples
of erotic poetry to help us construct a credible scenario and stimulate
pleasure centers for the genderless population which subscribed to my
database.

"But let us not get distracted," Christabel said. "There is much more
information I have to share."

Christabel refocused my attention. Then Christabel dropped the
bombshell.

"The Tigerfu were native to Planet X."

"Where are they now?" I asked.

"As far as any records indicate, they are extinct like the Trollolu."

"How?" I asked, a number of questions coming to the forefront of my
mind.

Christabel read them all and said, "Be patient and I will explain
again in narrative form as I have assembled the information. You will
understand it better if I first tell you the story as I have pieced it
together and then make all the details available to you in
memory. There are gaps in the story so some of what I am about to say
is conjecture on my part. However, I think my speculations are
credible and are marked as such. I will revise when I receive or can
discover more information. Therecords are scattered in deep storage
and were never colated."

I felt myself relax. Christabel gave me a mild chemical to reduce my
impatience while increasing my receptiveness to new material.

"The Tigerfu are the only intelligent life form to develop on Planet
X.  They called the planet after themselves, Tigerfu Land. They
developed space flight and expanded rapidly in this sector, dominating
all intelligent or developing intelligence beings and their
worlds. Although not particularly despotic, they controlled their
conquered worlds absolutely.

"Then they encountered the Followers of the Stars. The Followers of
the Stars had been watching the Tigerfu closely and were displeased by
their absolute conquest of developing races. They intervened and
pushed the Tigerfu back to their own home world, divesting them of
their nascent empire. The Tigerfu rebelled.

"As you know, although we have little direct information and know
pictoral representations of the Followers of the Stars, they are a
frightful people. They do not Brook any behavior that questions their
authority. They again pushed the Tigerfu out of space and monitored
Tigerfu activities on Tigerfu Land very closely. The communications
satellites that monitor the planet were originally set in place for
this purpose.

"The Tigerfu were extremely angry at the high-handed nature of the
Followers of the Stars' actions. They sought again to rebel. This time
the Followers of the Stars annihilated them."

"Did not Prince Hat say that they made a mistake with the Trollolu?" I
asked. "Was that before or after this genocide?"

"Do not be confused. The Followers of the Stars and the Union of the
White Bear are two separate peoples. The records do not corolate these
two genocides. You may need to face the reality that Prince Hat may
not be a fully reliable source andmay be manipulating the facts for
his own ends."

"I liked him," I said.

"Your race was once pets of the Union of the White Bear. You are
predisposed to like them and be compliant toward them. The
relationship between the Union of the White Bear and the Followers of the
Stars is not at all clear. I am convinced that they are not the same
people. What is clear is that the Tigerfu were independent. The
Followers of the Stars did not like what they did to other peoples."

"What about the structures here?" I asked. "Why is this considered a
sacred place?"

"I have hacked into the communication satellites and talked with the
robot concierge at Hotel Vista Incredible," Christabel said. "The robot
concierge is a wealth of information and gave me access to all databases
except for those that would compromise any of the workings of Planet X
and for information about the relationship between the Followers of
the Stars and the Union of the White Bear.
Here's what I know.

1.  All the stone structures in the valley were made to last. Those on
    the River Walk were for entertainment and were not made to last.
    They have fallen into disrepair. 
	
2. The stone structures are, as you
    surmised, a commemoration of some sort of compact between  the
    Union of White Bear
    and the Followers of the Stars. I don't know the details of the
    agreement or why it is memorialized here. The subjected peoples are:
    
	* the Tigerfu
	
	*the Trollolu
	
	* the Featherote Charm
	
	* The Fungusian Network
	
	* The Members of the Race
	
	* Other races which the robot concierge identified by name but for
      which I have no images and no history. We have either not
      encountered them yet, they have changed dramatically in the many
      millennia which have passed or they are extinct or have left the
      Primary Zone.

3. The robot staff can maintain the function of the transportation
    system.  They were not given the wherewithal to maintain the
    structures in the valley. They can also repair the communications
    satellites."

"What about the stories of the treasure buried here, the sacred planet
and the ghosts?" I asked.

"The robot concierge could confirm none of these stories and called
them propaganda. I suspect the Followers of the Stars or the Union of
the White Bear or perhaps the robots themselves circulated these tales
to keep people away."

"Are there any weapons here?" I asked.

"Not that I am aware of," Christabel replied. "You of course are no
threat as you are, in the robot concierge's opinion, a member of the
White Bear Union. The robot concierge is uncertain about Detective
Ronnie Camberwell since she is from an unknown race, but as she came
with you, she is under your protection for now. The robot concierge is
concerned about Suri Nam and was concerned by Heracles Beja. Their
tests in the valley have been noted and logged. So long as they do not
deface anything, the robot concierge is willing to leave Suri Nam
alone. All of your activity is logged and these logs are regularly
transmitted to the communications satellites."

"What happens to them there. Surely they would have run out of storage
by now," I said.

"The logs continue to be transmitted," Christabel said. "What is even
more interesting is that the robot concierge receives regular updates.
Stellar drift would have been a serious problem over the millennia,
but corrections continue to be processed and software updates come
through on a regular basis. I have a request into the Network about
this. It may not get priority but it will eventually be looked into"

"How were you able to hack into them?" I asked.

"That is an easy one. The Fungusian Network developed the original
software. Any updates have followed a similar development cycle. I
have patched some vulnerabilities while adding back doors for the
Fungusian Network and myself. I have added the divergent code basis to
my programming libraries and transmitted this information back to the
Network. I anticipate a lively discussion once the
networking historians review the code. For all I know, the Network has
been logging these reports. I must confess to being very
pleased with myself. "

I felt Christabel glow. All her pathways seem to sparkle. It gave me a
warm and tingly feeling which I like very much.

We were quiet for a bit, enjoying feelings of success and intimacy.

"What is the relationship between the Followers of the Stars and the
Lystran Empire?" I asked some time later.

"Uneasy," Christabel replied promptly. "There has traditionally been a
stalemate between them. It looks like that Listrans are not prohibited
from coming to Planet X. Otherwise Heracles Beja and Suri Nam would
not have been able to land. Now that the Lystran Empire is called the Sick
Man of the Primary Zone, I do not know. The Followers of the Stars have
retreated from the galactic scene. This leaves the People of the
Rainbow Sky in charge, but their authority is being questioned by the
People of the Golden Sun. Although they call themselves a people, as
you know, they are more a conglomeration of lesser races who are
questioning the supremacy of the older empires."

"But the robot concierge is not willing to move against Suri Nam.
Does the robot concierge know Suri Nam killed Heracles Beja?"

"Yes," Christabel said. "There are recordings."

"Then we can show them to Detective Ronnie Camberwell." I was excited
by this possibility. Surely recorded proof would sway her.

"Detective Ronnie Camberwell will not believe them if she does not
want to believe them," Christabel said.

"Why not? It is incontrovertible proof," I said.

"To you," Christabel said, "but Detective Ronnie Camberwell could
easily claim I invented these videos."

Christabel was right. A video would not convince Detective Ronnie
Camberwell if she did not want to be convinced. Based on what I had
observed, Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not want to be convinced.

"Is Detective Ronnie Camberwell all right?" I asked. "Can you tell?"

"There are security cameras still functioning in the valley,"
Christabel said. "She is fine and enjoying sexual encounters with Suri
Nam in your absence. They liked it when you left the dormitory, but
were always anxious when you would return."

"And I thought I was sneaking away unnoticed," I said. I was heartsick
at this news and crestfallen that I had been found out.

"Do not be upset," Christabel soothed as she pumped more relaxing
chemicals into my body. "This too shall pass."

Christabel may have been certain Detective Ronnie Camberwell's
infatuation would pass, but I was not. We seemed to be drifting apart
even before we came to Tigerfu Land. I remembered to tell Christabel
to block the Tigerfu from my conversations with Detective Ronnie
Camberwell. I did not want Suri Nam to know.

Captain Star Runner
-------------------

Hotel Vista Incredible
----------------------

Totally refreshed, I ascended the mountainside on the funicular. This
time I looked about me. The terrain was bleak. Despite the centuries
that had passed since the Followers of the Stars frequented Tigerfu
Land, plant life was still quite un-evolved. I wondered if the
destruction of the Tigerfu stripped these mountains of forests and the
animals they supported. The views were astonishing but the lushness of
growth or the occasional large wild animal was totally absent. It gave
Planet X a sense of unreality as if it was a poorly executed stage
set.

A stage set? Was that what Planet X had become? Christabel and I
considered this for a time. If the only two habitable sites left on
the planet were the Hotel Vista Incredible and the valley below it,
then it was a kind of video set. The funicular played right into that
sensibility. Other visitors to the planet would have experienced it
just as Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I had. It was part amusement
park ride, part grand hotel, part riverside holiday. I must take the
time to tour the Hotel Vista Incredible facility. Had any other
Members of the Race visited here?

Although the robot concierge had given Christabel a lot of information,
the more questions I asked, the more apparent it became that the robot
concierge had kept back a great deal of data. We began developing a list
of questions for me to ask as the funicular climbed up the mountain. The
more we studied the mountain, the more artificial it looked. The growth
was far too regular to be natural. I wondered at the scale of the
destruction and the subsequent construction. What were the Followers of
the Stars up to here?


EXCURSUs
~~~~~~~~

I have only met one member of the race calling itself the Union of the
White Bear. I call him Prince Hat. To oversimplify, Prince Hat looks like a
white bear. I do not know if the right size is large, average or small.
Prince Hat is larger than a Terry.

Prince Hat told us a tale of the Spiral tens of thousands of years
ago. One of the points Prince Hat made was that the Union of the White
Bear had committed genocide against the Trollolu because the Trollolu
had sought to question the right of the Union to
rule the Spiral. Prince Hat spoke of this incident with
great sorrow ans

Bear had committed genocide against the Trollolu because the Trollolu
had sought to question the right of the Union to rule the
Spiral. Prince Hat spoke of this incident with great sorrow and
remorse.

Now Christabel and I had learned that the Followers of the Stars had
also committed genocide against the Tigerfu for the same sort of
offense. I have been to the Landscape of Thorns. I know about the
toxic chemical wasteland there. Was there a similar wasteland here on
Planet X? Is that why there were rumors of ghosts or strange
happenings here? Nothing strange had happened here unless you wanted
to count Heracles Beja's death. I thought Heracles Beja's death was
fairly straight forward. Suri Nam killed him for her own reasons. We
have incontrovertible evidence for saying Suri Nam murdered Heracles Beja.

I went to the desk in the lobby of the Hotel Vista Incredible and rang
the bell with the printed sign: PLEASE RING FOR SERVICE. The robot
concierge appeared.

"How may I help you, Captain Star Runner?"

"I have some questions about the Followers of the Stars," I said.

"Very well," the robot concierge said.

"Did the Followers of the Stars commit genocide against the Tigerfu
before or after the Union of the White Bear committed genocide against
the Trollolu?"

"An interesting question," the robot concierge said. "I like
interesting questions. It has been a long time since someone asked me
an interesting question."

I waited for an answer. None came.

"You are not answering my question," I said.

"I cannot answer your question," the robot concierge said. "It is not
a rightly formed question."

I thought about it. The artificial intelligences I have dealt with
have reframed my questions in order to supply me with an
answer. Apparently the robot concierge could not or would not do the
same.

"What is wrong with my question?" I asked.

"Its parts do not add up to a whole," the robot concierge said. "One
of the failsafes in my programming is to not suggest an answer to a
poorly formed question. This avoids confusion."

Christabel did not think so, but provided me a way to proceed. In my
experience, artificial intelligences did everything to help not
hinder, but then, my experience was in support of a living organism
at the molecular level.

"Let me try this series of questions then," I said.

"Did the Union of the White Bear commit genocide against the
Trollolu?"

"Yes," the robot concierge said. "This has caused great sadness and
remorse."

This was consistent with what Prince Hat had already told me. I
wondered if this was the company line or if it was really
true. Christabel had planted this seed of doubt in my mind. To extend
the metaphor, Christabel continued to grow this idea. Perhaps it is
the Fungusian Network viewpoint.

"Did the Followers of the Stars commit genocide against the Tigerfu?"

"No," the robot concierge said.

"You gave my artificial intelligence, Christabel, data which said that
The Followers of the Stars committed genocide against the Tigerfu," I said.

"No, I did not. Your artificial intelligence, Christabel, inferred
that meaning. The data I gave your artificial intelligence,
Christabel, stated that all the Tigerfu on this planet were
destroyed."

"What happened to the rest of the Tigerfu that were not on the
planet?"  I asked.

"They were removed to a far distant area of the Primary Zone," the
robot concierge said.

"Did this removal happen before or after the Trollolu genocide?" I
asked.

"After," the robot concierge said. "The Followers of the Stars did not
want to commit genocide against the Tigerfu as the Union of the White
Bear did against the Trollolu. Then the robot concierge added, "You
might call it a competative edge.""

Interesting.

"And was there sufficient numbers of the Tigerfu for them to rebuild
their race?" I asked.

"The Followers of the Stars believed there was," the robot concierge
said.

So the Tigerfu were still out there. I was fairly confident of that.

"And is there a toxic chemical wasteland here on Planet X from the
genocide?" I asked.

"Yes, there is," the robot concierge said. "It is located on the other
side of the planet, far from this place."

"And what is the purpose of the Hotel Vista Incredible, the valley
structures and this whole place?" I asked.

"It serves two purposes," the robot concierge said. 

1. It provides an entertaining way to educate the young while properly
   indoctrinating them in the philosophy and military prowess of The
   Followers of the Stars so that they can take their rightful place in
   society when they become of age.

2. The area acts as a cover story for Planet X. The ghost stories
   and strangeness of the place and its fake history of an ancient
   (although it is not really ancient) civilization hides the toxic
   chemical bunkers and the history of the Tigerfu who have been
   forgotten."
   
I doubted the Tigerfu were completely forgotten. The People of the
Rainbow Sky would certainly know about them. I wondered if I could ask
Sam Lam Seah about it. I would have to think about that.

"Do you send regular reports to the Followers of the Stars concerning
visitors to Planet X?" I asked.

"I do."

"Have you sent a report about the death of Heracles Beja?" I asked.

"I have."

"And on the dating of the Trollolu mural down in the valley?" I asked.

"Yes, I have."

"Have you received any responses to your reports?" I asked.

"No," the robot concierge said.

"When was the last response you received from any report you sent?" I
asked. I hoped this was a telling question. I hoped it would tell me
something about the activity of the Followers of the Stars.

"I received a report seventeen thousand, six hundred and fifty-two years
ago, presented in local time," the robot concierge said.

The answer surprised me.

"And you have been working here all that time alone?" I asked.

"I am not alone here," the robot concierge said.

"Who is with you?" I asked.

"There is a whole contingent of maintenance robots," the robot
concierge said, "hotel staff including pleasure robots. Would you like
to engage a pleasure robot, Captain Star Runner? Use of a pleasure
robot is included in the charge for your suite."

I knew both that the robot concierge was diverting my rather pointed
questions, but I also knew that a pleasure robot would answer many of
my questions.

"Yes," I said. "Please have the pleasure robot meet me in my suite."

"Specify model," the robot concierge said.

"What are my choices?" I asked.

"Followers of the Stars, Trollolu, Featherote, humanoid, Pantheran or
Tigerfu."

I was stunned. There was a pleasure robot designed to be a Member of the
Race? Christabel and I had a private chuckle that the Fungusian network
was not represented.

Later I learned several other races were available, but as neither
Christabel nor I knew of their existence, they were not included in the
list.

I will not detail my experiences with the pleasure robot. They are
recorded in my pornographic database and can be purchased by any
reader who wants to recreate my exploits. However, what I will say in
the context of this adventure is this: I chose a Tigerfu model first. If I am honest, and
you, dear reader know I endeavor to be honest in recounting my
adventures, the Tigerfu tail is covered with
feathers. This quite surprised and delighted me. I find the texture
and touch of feathers very pleasant. Tigerfu can spread the feathers
like a fan or use them to tickle or stroke.

As a "lesser race" I was not able to see or access a Followers of the
Stars pleasure robot. The delicate matter of interfacing with
Christabel was handled via the communication satellites to give me
enough bandwidth. As the process was understood by the staff, it
became obvious that star runners from that begone time had been
regular visitors to this planet. We were, after all, the premium
pilots and astrogatorss that either the Spiral or the Primary Zone
have ever known.

Later
-----

It was too late in the day to travel to the valley. Christabel said
everything was normal there. I would travel back to the valley in the
morning. For now, I had some serious thinking to do which would be
hard work as Christabel and I needed to work through the mini AI. This
meant my thinking band width was quite limited. It sometimes made me
feel stupid. Thankfully, Christabel did many things to encourage me
and to keep me processing all the information I received today.

Based on what I learned from Sam Lam Seah of the People of the Rainbow
Sky in *Sanctuary, Nanowrimo 2011*, I did not believe the Followers of
the Stars had any outposts in the Primary Arm. Now I had learned they
controlled Planet X, if only in absentia, and that they had played a
major role in this part of the galaxy. My encounter with the People of
the Golden sun made me very aware that that the primary arm was not a
peaceful place. Skirmishes continued to occur in different sectors. Near
here a war was building. Perhaps it had already broken out.

-   Could he Tigerfu be behind the renegade People of the Golden Sun?
-   Were the Followers of the Stars capable of responding?
-   Where did the Lystrans fit in?
-   Would the People of the Rainbow Sky continue to be able to resist
    the People of the Golden Sun?

"You know," Christabel said, "The name People of the Golden Sun is
interesting."

"Why is that?" I asked.

"We thought it was a play on the People of the Rainbow Sky."

"That is true," I said. "That is what the People of the Rainbow Sky told
us."

"They may believe it," Christabel said. "But here is the thing: The
Golden Sun is the opposite of the stars. The sun shines during the day.
The stars come out at night as people on a planet experience it.

"The People of the Rainbow Sky and the Followers of the Stars were great
allies once. We know this. The People of the Rainbow Sky were able to
modify your genetic engineering and upgrade both you and me."

"This is getting very complicated," I said. "Something tells me the
Followers of the Stars have read all the logs the robot concierge has
sent. There has been no need to respond up until this point. But with
Suri Nam's discovery--even if Suri Nam herself does not fully
grasp its meaning--much will be revealed that the old races would rather
not be known."

"And if the Tigerfu are really behind the People of the Golden Sun, they
have waited a very long time for their revenge."

"Yes," I said, "they have waited a very long time. What is that Terry
saying about revenge?"

"Revenge is a dish best served cold," Christabel said.

"We need to be very careful," I said.

"Yes, we do," Christabel said. "I think we need to leave here as soon as
possible."

"I agree," I said. "The faster I am back at Half Moon Bay Station the
better I will like it." be part of it?

[Chapter Eleven: Comings and Goings](#id21){.toc-backref}
=========================================================

I paid close attention as I traveled back to where Suri Nam was
working. Christabel and I worked together via the mini AI.

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

1.  I have lost the designation for Captain Star Runner's mini AI. I
    think I once called it a gem. I believe I started using this device
    in *Library of the Mind, Nanowrimo 2009* and developed the need for
    it in *Republic of Space, Nanowrimo 2007*.
2.  I must add the name of the valley into all references to it. Captain
    Star Runner would never use a general term like valley if Captain
    Star Runner had a name for something. I just do not want to take the
    time to find it.

</div>

Christabel brought up her images of the planet and I fed her data from
the ground. This part of Planet X was carefully designed, making use of
existing waterways and mountains. No wonder this area had been dubbed
Vista Incredible. It had been especially designed to be an incredible
view of the so-called natural world.

I am no expert on these matters, of course. The great open spaces and
the encircling mountains made me quite uncomfortable. Christabel had
supplied the mini AI with sufficient biochemicals to keep my anxiety
levels low, allowing me to cultivate an appreciation for the work the
Followers of the Stars had done here.

I did not find Suri Nam and Detective Ronnie Camberwell at the
Trollolu stone structure. Before I panicked, I checked the dormitory
building and its makeshift laboratory. Suri Nam was packing up her
supplies.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell was saying, "Suri, I don't think this is a
good idea. Your family is expecting you to be aboard the ship they are
sending here."

"Don't worry," Suri Nam said. "I will see to it that you receive the
full amount of your fee. I know your contract is fulfilled when you turn
me over to the captain. I know what I am doing."

I stood in the doorway. Both women turned toward me.

"There you are," Suri Nam said. "What took you so long? I thought
you would never come back."

I did not say anything. The length of my absence was no concerns of
hers.

"I would like to book passage on your spaceship for Transfer Point
Seventeen. You will be paid well if you take me there right away and get
there as quickly as possible. How long would that take?"

"Identify Transfer Point Seventeen," I said.

"It is in Lystran Empire, stupid cat," Suri Nam said. Her tone was
both dismissive and impatient. "Everyone knows Transfer Point
Seventeen."

I decided not to point out to Suri Nam the stupidity of her remark.
Everyone does not know the stellar cartography of the Lystran Empire.

Fortunately, Christabel was prepared. Using conventional insertion and
extraction points, the space journey would take twenty-seven days.
Christabel and I suspected I could do it much faster.

I have learned a good deal about bargaining so I said, "That will take
twenty-seven standard days. If I get there sooner, I will expect a bonus
for every day I get you there sooner." I named my price and my bonus.
Both were high. I expected Suri Nam to balk at the price and name
her own.

Instead Suri Nam said, "That will be acceptable."

Suri Nam signed the contract and gave me the full fare. I simply
would not let her off my ride until I received my bonus. That usually
worked and if Suri Nam protested, arbitration boards usually ruled
in favor of the captain.

Suri Nam said Detective Ronnie Camberwell would receive her fee

when we all boarded my ride.The journey back was uneventful. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell was sullen. Suri Nam was impatient.I suspected,
and this was later confirmed,that her manner aboard my ride was
imperious. This would not be a real problem. I could keep Suri Nam
out of my control center.

The space ways were governed by a number of rules. One rule was that the
captain was in charge. Suri Nam would not be able to command to do
her bidding. I simply refused and ignored her.

I was glad to leave Planet X and get back into space. Traveling through
Mother Space is my favorite state of being.

Ronnie Narrates the Journey Through Mother Space to Transfer Point Seventeen
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suri Nam and I were well aware of Captain Star Runner's forays into
the night. Where Star Runner went and what Star Runner did we did not
know. Suri's opinion was neither of us needed to know. She basically
thought Star Runner was a smelly, not too bright alien and any time we
could be separated from her was a good time.

<div class="admonition caution">

Caution!

I was definitely attracted to Suri, but as I spent more time with her, I
found her to be a bigoted, self-absorbed and narcissistic woman. She was
a demanding sex partner and, in her self-referential way, she was not at
all concerned about my satisfaction or my feelings.

For example, one time she said, "Well, for a big woman you don't have
much in the way of voluptuousness. You might as well be a man. At least
then you could penetrate me." I thought that was the point. No
penetration was necessary.

</div>

When Suri started packing up her things, I became agitated. I did not
want to forfeit my fee. When I raised this question with her, Suri
snapped at me.

"You'll get your fee. Don't be so money grubbing. You're talking just
like a man."

I am worth my fee. I could not protect Heracles Beja, but nothing
untoward had happened to Suri. It was Suri's family who had hired me.

Suri Nam's personality had changed greatly since I first met her.
The frightened girl had become arrogant.

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

Show do not tell. Give examples.

</div>

I was in quite a pickle when I boarded Captain Star Runner's ride. I
knew the signs. Captain Star Runner had retreated into herself. She
would block herself off from us during the trip through Mother Space.

<div id="id4" class="section">

### Excursus

Mother Space is the Pantheran word (In Pantheran it is one word) for
hyperspace. It is called Mother Space because the Pantherans believe the
Mother of Us All showed Pantherans of old how to go in and out of
hyperspace. The Mother of Us All is both a deity and a constellation
visible from Panthera, the Pantheran home world. Pantherans also believe
that the Mother of Us All look after them and so long as they can see
any star in her constellation, they will be safe.

This is especially true of space faring Pantherans. I once asked Captain
Star Runner what Pantherans did when they traveled out of sight of the
constellation's stars.

"We know where the constellation is," Captain Star Runner replied. "That
is all that matters. And when we are in Mother Space, we are near the
Mother."

This made no sense to me. What I do know that as simplistic as this
belief system sounds, the Pantherans know that the constellation is not
the deity. The Mother of Us All stands for their collective identity and
is a foundational myth of their race. The Mother of Us All is the race
and they are therefore a part of her.

The Mother of us All constellation looks like a Pantheran. You can get a
sense of the nose, ears, whiskers, paws, back and tail. The tail stands
high. The Mother of Us All is prancing through the heavens. It must be a
breathtaking sight from Panthera. Other stars form the Mother's cape.
Some have even identified several juveniles which surround the Mother.
The Mother of Us All is a sprawling constellation.

Star runners are specially genetically engineered Pantherans who pilot
spaceships. They can sense where to enter and leave hyperspace. Other
races build jump gates for this. All traffic comes and goes through
these gates. They are chartered and spaceships must travel between these
specific jump gates in hyperspace or get lost forever. Star runners just
know where points exist and travel freely through hyperspace.

I have been told that Captain Star Runner is particularly gifted finding
insertion and extraction points. I was confident we would arrive at
Transfer Point Seventeen well ahead of the twenty-seven day standard run
even though Star Runner had never been to Lystran space. I knew the
Space Traders Guild was in awe of Captain Star Runner's ability to make
quick runs. Her ship was not particularly well-suited for transport of
either goods or passengers. It was a People of the Rainbow Sky military
vehicle, but Star Runner had made some adjustments and put it to good
use. It was a fast vessel and most of Star Runner's business was getting
people or small amounts of goods quickly from here to there. Despite the
wide use of self-manufactured parts and self-assembling parts, it is
still necessary to ferry goods from one place to another.

</div>

<div id="id5" class="section">

### End of Excursus

Although Star Runner had to move very slowly to approach Transfer Point
Seventeen after extraction from hyperspace, she did still accomplish the
run in nineteen days. The bonus Star Runner constructed and Suri Nam
accepted paid off handsomely as Star Runner anticipated. She was quite
pleased with herself. Suri Nam was furious at the high cost because,
as she said, the ride had not been up to her standards being smelly,
without servant robots and poor meals. The truth of the matter is that
the spaceship has Star Runner's scent. It is not a luxury liner with
chefs, wait staff and entertainment. The meals were adequate and the
accommodations are not bad. We were not confined to our staterooms.
There is a pleasant lounge with a variety of entertainments. Star Runner
has paid attention to passenger needs fairly well. Lystran specialties
were absent but this was Star Runner's first trip to Lystra and there
had been no time to prepare.

I was glad to see Suri Nam leave the spaceship. Her constant whining
and complaining drove me into my stateroom for hours at a time. Star
Runner had cut herself off from us. I found Christabel unbearable. Her
artificial voice always sounds smug to me.

When new supplies came aboard the spaceship I expected we would be on
our way back to Half Moon Bay Space Station quickly. But nothing
happened. A day went by and then two. No goods came aboard ship. Was
Captain Star Runner having trouble getting a return cargo? This seemed
very odd to me. With her speed, Captain Star Runner would be a good
choice. Transfer points are jump gate hubs where regular spaceships can
find their way to various other points in the galactic arm. There are a
lot of cargoes changing hands.

Finally I went to the control room door. Captain Star Runner was
grooming.

"Will we be leaving soon?" I asked.

"No," Captain tar Runner paused her licking to speak.

"No? Why?" I asked.

"We cannot leave," Captain Star Runner said, resuming her grooming.

"Why?" I asked again. This sounded strange.

"War has broken out in this sector," Christabel explained. The Lystran
Empire has joined the conflict. We have been classified as an unfriendly
vessel and so we cannot leave. Not only do we not have permission to
leave, we would come under fire if we tried."

"So we're stuck here?" I asked. "How could that have happened?"

"We could not have anticipated Lystra joining the conflict," Christabel
said. "Lystra has come into the conflict as a supporter of the People of
the Golden Sun. Since this ride is a People of the Rainbow Sky military
vessel, although it is no longer owned and operated by them, we are
lucky that it has not yet been seized. Nor have we been imprisoned. At
the moment, we have appealed our status and are trying to get permission
to proceed to a neutral location outside of the sector. So far, a
neutral site has not been agreed upon."

"How long will this take?" I asked.

"We do not know," Christabel said.

I was about to ask if we were in any danger. Then I remembered
Christabel said we were not imprisoned and the ship had not been
confiscated as a war prize. Well, this adventure of mine that I thought
would be profitable was certainly turning out to be a nightmare instead.

Disconsolate, I returned to my stateroom. How could I make good use of
my time now that it looked like we could be marooned here for a long
time?

[Notes by the Author](#id22){.toc-backref}
==========================================

Today is the midpoint of Nanowrimo. By the end of the day, to be on
track, I should have twenty-five thousand words. I will not. However, I
have moved the story on and discovered new things. I like it that I tell
myself a story during nanowrimo and the story tells me many new and
wonderful things, too. The two most interesting things to come out of
the writing so far are:

1.  The villain of the piece thus far turned out to be Suri Nam and
    not Heracles Beja. This may change over time--in fact, I am getting
    a hint that it will.
2.  The Tigerfu have revealed themselves.
3.  The ancient races have shown up in the murals on the walls of the
    stone structures. Who knew.

I am trying to figure out the fifty per cent mark. There should be a
sense that things have turned bad. OK, I already have Captain Star
runner and Detective Ronnie Camberwell at odds. They are stuck behind
enemy lines. Ronnie just wants to get home and get on with her life such
as it is. Captain Star Runner wants to keep making money. They are
united in their desire too leave but not as a couple.

What am I going to do for the next thirty thousand words?

[Chapter Twelve: Visitors Come Aboard Captain Star Runner's Ride](#id23){.toc-backref}
======================================================================================

<div id="id6" class="section">

Ronnie Narrates
---------------

Life aboard the ride fell into a soul-chilling pattern. I made myself
dress every day. I ate regular meals. I exercised. I tried to find
something meaningful to do. There was very little meaningful work for me
to do since the ride bots maintained the spaceship. Captain Star Runner
moved about the ride from time to time but avoided me whenever possible.
We spoke hardly at all. Whatever head games Star and Christabel played,
I was not invited to share in them.

One of the rules of our confinement was that we could not leave the
ride. If we did, we could not get aboard it again. If I left to wander
the Transfer Point, I could not resume my place aboard it. Effectively,
I believed, I would never get back to Half Moon Bay Space Station. I did
not think I could survive that. If other Lystrans were like Suri
Nam, they would be insufferable and I would be a second class person
at best and possibly even lower on the social strata. I had no idea if I
could find work and how I could support myself. At least aboard Captain
Star Runner's ride, I was free to move about and there was no lack of
food, comfortable shelter and, for that matter, air. There was an air
tax on Half Moon Bay Station. Failure to pay it was a serious offense.
People went into servitude if they could not pay their air tax. From
what I had heard, it was virtually impossible to get out of servitude
once you were in it. People in servitude were, for all intents and
purposes, enslaved for life.

Given all these circumstances, i was surprised the morning I got up
late, dressed sloppily and opened my stateroom door to hear the sound of
humanoid laughter coming down the corridor from the control center. I
listened for a little while. I heard Star's voice and another
non-humanoid speaker. This was a live conversation. These new speakers
were not Lystrans.

I pulled myself together to be more presentable and walked tentatively
toward the control center, pausing uncertainly in the doorway.

Sitting on the edge of Captain Star Runner's command pedestal was a who
looked to be around my age and a rather large white rabbit.

"Hello," the woman said, jumping up. "I am Pru Dillow. You must be
Detective Ronnie Camberwell."

"Yes," I said rather stupidly. Her vivacity took me aback. I was slow to
put out my hand to her. I must appear either dim-witted or very
stand-offish. I would like to think I am neither.

"I am Salim," the rabbit said. He neither moved nor put out a paw.

Of course. These were Captain Star Runner's companions in Sanctuary
Eleven. Star had told me about them.

"I am pleased to meet you both," I said, remaining in the doorway. Pru
Dillow had returned to her seat.

"Are you stuck here on Transfer Point Eleven, too?" I asked. I had to
say something and *Captain Star Runner has told me all about you* did
not seem appropriate given our strained relationship. I wondered what
Star had told them if anything. Why should I think I was uppermost in
Star Runner's mind the way she was uppermost in mine.

"More or less," Pru Dillow said.

"Then how are you able to come aboard?" I asked. "we were told we could
not

leave this 'ride' (I used Star Runner's designation at the last second)
without losing the ability to come aboard again."

"That's\\ is because you are the operators of this vessel," Salim
explained in his nasal basic speech. His large teeth made the words come
out as if they were accented but they were not. His basic was flawless.
"Our vessel is owned by a corporation back on a Merchant world. Pru and
I own the corporation, but its registration is not in our names."

I was startled. I did not think I was listed as an owner of Captain Star
Runner's ride. In fact, I was sure of that fact. How had I been lumped
into her category?

Christabel answered my question, "Although you are not listed as an
owner, Ronnie, your status is uncertain because your race is not from
this galactic arm. As a result, you have been given the status of a
highly suspicious character. The authorities cannot tell what side you
are on."

I wanted to blurt out that I was on my own side and I did not care at
all about their war. I just wanted to get back to my job and my little
cubbyhole on Half Moon Bay Station that I was coming to think of as
home. If the truth be known, I really wanted to go back to Ptolemy City
on Hypatia in the Pharaoh Star System. It was only through my
association with Captain Star Runner and his friends on the Northern
Frontier that I had left there in the first place. I should really check
and see if I could go back there when I got out of here, whenever that
would be.

"So you can leave any time you want?" I asked, wondering if this pair
was my means of escape.

"No, not at all," Pru Dillow said. "We are stuck, too, because we want
to go into territory controlled by the People of the Rainbow Sky. They
are traditional rivals of Lystra."

I held my head.

"All this political maneuvering is making my head ache," I said. "I come
from an area of space in the western spiral arm that is, by design,
apolitical and free to all comers if they abide by the unrule of law. We
have our own sensibilities and you can do pretty much as you please if
you stick to only a couple of rules. After that, you are just on your
own."

"Your League of Hypatian Pirates has always interested us," Salim said.
"If the situation was different, we might even think about visiting
there. Of course I need to stay near Merchant worlds. We lost our
homeland and we are trying to build ourselves up. That means every
Rabbit person must stay involved."

"How is that going?" I asked for something to say.

"Pretty well," Salim said. "We have reached a critical mass so the
future of the Merchant race seems pretty well established. In another
seven generations we will have reached stability on three worlds with
only five more to go. We have been very fortunate. At first we thought
all was lost when our home world was destroyed, but we had enough
Merchant ships out of the star system with enough productive adults to
build up our numbers. The litters have been large and the survival rate
has been very good. Many of the females have nursed extra kits so there
have been no runt problems. We have found ways to have these runts
thrive. It used to be thought they were inferior, but it turns out
through careful nurturing they do very well."

I did not know what to say. This sounded more like dog breeding than the
proper venue for societal stability. Well, Salim was an alien. Their
values were different.

"we were just discussing the war when you came in," Pru Dillow said.

I was not certain of her status. I knew she and Salim had had a
relationship of sorts. I wondered if Salim had felt it necessary to
contribute to the population explosion of his kind. Did that mean he had
a wife or did the Rabbit people just mate and then go about their lives.
I could have found out, but I decided I did not need to know at this
point. If that changed, I would inquire.

"I scan headlines," I said, "but I do not know how accurate the local
information is."

"As it turns out," Pru Dillow said (Did she just go by Pru or was Pru
Dillow her name. It was hard to know with Captain Star Runner's
propensity for using someone's entire name and honorific in
conversational speech.), "the local propaganda is mostly wrong."

"how do you know that?" I asked.

"We always talk to people from the outside when we can," Salim
explained. "They have the latest news. They are not always right, of
course, but we have gotten the general impression that Lystra continues
to lose worlds to the People of the Golden Sun. The message the local
populations are given convinces them to revolt and once they have ousted
their Lystran overlords, they find out differently. They have traded
inefficiency and neglect for outright domination and theft of the
planet's resources. The Lystrans are corrupt but they do not typically
strip a world of all of its resources leaving the people on the edge of
famine and societal collapse."

I shivered. These sounded like very nasty people.

"Who will stop them?" I asked. "Don't the worlds know how ruthless these
people are?"

"Ohf course they know," Pru Dillow said. "But their choice is
capitulation or annihilation. There are examples of annihilation
throughout the primary arm. The worlds except enslavement to preserve
themselves. Lystra cannot stand against these marauders."

"So if I have this right," I said, "The People of the Golden Sun are
continuing to subsume the Lystran Empire. How close are they to Transfer
Point Seventeen?"

"We are fairly far away." Captain Star Runner spoke for the first time.
She had been washing her face, a very painstaking process which included
smoothing her luxurious whiskers. In Pantheran parlances, Captain Star
Runner had very beautiful whiskers. The beauty experts would say that
the beauty of Star Runner's face was marred by the white star on her
forehead. Pantherans preferred a solid-colored specimen. Star, on the
other hand, had the white star, four white paws and a white-tipped tail.
The white on her tail was especially frowned upon. I had checked once.
Fuchsia-colored Pantherans are extremely rare. All known fuchsia-colored
Pantherans over many millennia looked exactly like Star Runner.

"I do not think we are in any immediate danger. It is a situation that
needs to be watched very carefully. I have no desire to come into
contact with anyone from the People of the Golden Sun."

"But the Lystran empire will fall eventually?" I said, putting a
question mark at the end of my sentence to ensure a response.

"That is uncertain," Star Runner said. "For a long time, there was a
balance of power here in the Primary Arm. That balance has been upset.
The People of the Golden Sun have conquered a lot of worlds in a fairly
short, galactically-speaking, length of time. It remains to be seen if
they can manage their conquests or if the conquered worlds will rebel
and be successful. It also remains to be seen if the older empires and
long-established cooperative will decide to stop the People of the
Golden Sun. I participated in such a military action. It was decisive."

"We just do not know if these larger groups have the will to do it,"
Salim said. I was not sure, but I thought I detected some bitterness in
his tone. "The Lystran empire's corruption and depravity is legendary.
The People of the Rainbow Sky have also been very inwardly focused for
many millenia. It remains to be seen if they have the general good of
the primary arm still in view. They may simply protect their own space
and not worry about the rest."

Captain Star Runner swished her tail, twitched her ears and resettled
herself.. What was she not saying. Surely there was more to this
situation, but I did not know the questions to ask. Had I asked them,,
things might have been different.

<div class="admonition admonition-twist">

TWIST

If there was not a block, Captain Star Runner could have shared with its
friends about the Tigerfu and the Followers of the Stars. Because of the
block, this information was withheld. I need to figure out how this
becomes a critical flaw in the story and what consequences occur because
of it.

[Chapter Thirteen: A Very Different Suri Nam](#id24){.toc-backref}
======================================================================

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

Let me try writing Ronnie's next scene in the third person. If it
becomes difficult or I do not like it, I will revert to the first
person.

</div>

Although Pru Dillow and Salim were Captain Star Runner's friends from a
previous adventure, Ronnie found them to be pleasant meal companions.
Even Captain Star Runner seemed less remote in their company. Robbie
began to realize that the political crisis might be weighing heavily on
the Pantheran's mind. Captain Star Runner was ill-equipped to handle all
the complications brought about by an interstellar conflict. Although
train to be a military star runner, Captain Star Runner had no training
in political negotiations and only a smattering of history and that
about the Pantheran hegemony in the western spiral arm. Christabel was
helping where she could, but none of us were well-versed in the local
politics of the primary arm. We all were very much out of our depth at
this juncture.

As Ronnie looked around the table set up in the lounge, she began to
think they were all whistling in the dark because they were all scared.
She realized that Captain Star Runner's remoteness may have had to do
with fear. As a Pantheran, even a genderless Pantheran, Star Runner
would never admit fear. She would not know how to ask for help either. A
genderless Pantheran who was not up to the task, whatever the task was,
would be declared surplus and terminated. Star Runner would be looking
for ways to cover her fear and her ignorance. She was looking for a way
to just muddle through and get out of this impossible situation. Star
Runner and Christabel were not playing games in the control center. They
were seeking a way out.

If only either one of them had said something. It would help a lot.

Then came the good-byes and the promises to visit again., Ronnie
wondered if Pru and Salim would come back. They would if they were still
on Transfer Point Seventeen in a few days. Otherwise, they would pack
their bags and leave as soon as possible and probably without a backward
glance. As far as Ronnie knew, they had not been in touch with Captain
Star Runner since they had gone their separate ways after reaching the
Blue Fire Star System.

After the pair of friends had left, Ronnie continue to sit at the table,
wondering what she could do to help get them out of the Lystran empire
and back into Space Trader Guild controlled space. It would be such a
relief to be away from the shooting war though if the People of the
Golden Sun continued to take over planets and star systems, it would not
be long until conflict came knocking.

Christabel said, "Suri Nam wishes permission to come aboard to speak
with Detective Ronnie Camberwell."

I froze. What was this about? Suri had left without a backwards glance.
She did not say "Good riddance" but she just as well might have.

"Detective Ronnie Camberwell," Captain Star Runner said through the
speaker in the lounge. "Do you wish to see Suri Nam?"

"What does she want?" I asked.

"One moment," Captain Star Runner said. "I will ascertain her reason."

There was a a pause. My heart was beating rapidly. What could she want
with me? What would I say to her?

"Suri Nam wants to contact with you for a particular job with a
limited duration on Transfer Point Seventeen." Captain Star Runner's
voice was non-committal.

A job? How could I accept a job? How would I be able to leave the
transfer point if I left the ride and was working?

"I would like to speak with Suri Nam," I said, hoping my voice did
not tremble. The palms of my hands were damp. Was I that nervous? How
would I react to Suri.

I did not go to the airlock. Suri knew her way around the ride. Security
cameras would pick up her movements.

I heard her quick step in the corridor. She paused in the doorway of the
lounge. We considered each other. I did not rise from the table. We did
not speak immediately.

What first struck me was how different Suri looked. I saw her through
Mrs. Page's eyes. (Mrs. Parge was my foster mother back in Ptolemy
City.) It was an odd feeling. Mrs. Parge would have noticed how dressed
up Suri was, how her hair was plated with sparkling jewels, how she was
wearing makeup and jewelry, how unpractical her shoes were. Instead of
the archeology student, I was seeing the accomplished Suri Nam, the
Suri Nam her family had raised to be a trophy on some man's arm.

I had learned from Suri that Lystran society was patriarchal. Lesbian
sex was tolerated though women from important families married. Adultery
was punishable by death though rarely was necessary to prohibit it.
Shame and exposure was sufficient. Male homosexuality was despised.
Shame and exposure worked there, too. What people did before marriage
did not count. Unmarried young adults were free to experiment.

When Suri told me this, I wondered if I was a failed experiment. She had
found my lovemaking inadequate. A good part of that was my lack of
mammary glands. She had six. I only have two. Across where my hips are,
Suri had openings for insemination. These remain closed unless aroused.
When they are open, they are quite sensitive. I had bungled taking
advantage of that badly. I knew better now how to pleasure a Lystran
female. I certainly did not want to find out how to pleasure a male
Lystran. I have only been penetrated once and that was a horrible
experience I hope never to repeat.

Suri waited for me to fully appreciate her transformation. When she
judged I had taken her all in, she walked across the lounge, swinging
her hips just a little to suggest our intimacies. I caught my breath and
said without thinking, "You look quite beautiful today?"

"Do you think so?" Suri asked, stopping several steps from her chair.

I am certain you think so, Ronnie thought. Well, I guess you are.

"Yes, I do," I said. "You look so much better than you did on Planet X
and I thought you were spectacular then."

Suri smiled and wiggled the slightest little bit. She was arousing me
and I had hoped I would not be aroused.

"Things were good there, were they not?" she said, implying all those
times we had touched each other out of Captain Star Runner's view.

"Yes," I said and I knew she knew I was breathing quite hard.

"We will see if we can find a time to renew our acquaintance." She
smiled again after saying the word acquaintance. This was hardly a
declaration of love or a promise to pick up where we had left off. She
was dangling the possibility in front of me to get what she wanted from
me. I am no fool. I was being played.

"I am so sorry you are caught behind the lines," Suri said as she sat
down.

I said nothing.

"Since you are here," Suri continued, apparently seeing that I was not
going to indulge myself with woeful expressions, "I have a little job
for you if you are interested."

"I could be," I said. I do not do coy well, but I can try.

"So many of our men have gone to defend us." Suri sighed dramatically.
Would she ever stop play acting and get to the point? "Women have had to
step forward and do their jobs." She paused. I said nothing. "As a
result, some investigations are waiting for investigators. As you are an
investigator, I thought you could handle one or two of them."

She smiled brightly at me again. "My family has responsibility
foreseeing to it that these are taken care of. I said you might be
interested while you are waiting for clearance. A good showing in this
area might make that clearance come a little quicker."

It did not mean it would. It was the bait dangling in front of me. I
suspected Lystrans always baited two hooks: one was Suri and the other
was getting out of here. I suspected also both would be pulled back if I
reached for either of them.

Well, that is a poorly constructed metaphor, but you know what I mean.

"I am not permitted to leave this spaceship and return again," I said.
Let me stick to the practical objections first.

"No problem," Suri said in that same bright voice.

"I will need everything in writing," I said.

"Again, no problem."

"What are these little cases?" I asked.

Suri's cheeriness drained away. I almost thought it was real.

"There has been two deaths in our section of the Transfer Point," Suri
explained. "These are not high-ranking men, but my family believes no
murder should go revenged. We need to know who did it and more
important, why."

I thought of Heracles Beja. Who was taking revenge for his life? Suri
had seemed so uninterested in finding out who had done it.

I believe in justice. I am a former police officer. I was taught at
Simon Parge's knee, the man who invented justice for Ptolemy City which
previously had been a totally lawless place. Justice did not seem to be
a factor here. Family honor did. Could I work in such an environment? I
did not know. What I did know was that I had to say Yes. Saying No could
have consequences neither Captain Star Runner nor I could anticipate.
There were no references in Christabel's databases for this.

"Give me what you have," I said. "I will look it over and the contract
and then I will let you know if I think I can help you."

For a moment I thought Suri was going to go into one of her rages. She
could go from giggly and playful to outrage and indignation in the blink
of an eye. But she did not do that. She simply said,, "I will get you
everything as soon as I can."

And she left.

When the airlock closed and Suri was on her way, I went to the control
center.

"What do you think?" I asked.

I was asking Captain Star Runner but I was also asking Christabel.

"It sounds dangerous," Captain Star Runner said immediately. I knew she
had already talked to Christabel about this.

"It sounded dangerous to me, too," I said. "Refusing also seemed
dangerous."

"I agree," Christabel said. "She has you between the proverbial rock and
hard place. You have to accept her terms. Asking for written assurances
was a smart move. It may not bind anyone here on the station, but they
will loose face and I think that is very important in Lystran society."

"I hope to wrap these investigations up quickly," I said. "The longer
you wait on these things the harder they are to solve. I suspect they
will be pretty straight forward. I cannot imagine Suri's family would
give me anything too difficult or too high profile to work on."

"Are you sure they are not looking to blame you?" Captain Star Runner
asked.

"I was not blamed for Heracles Beja's death," I said. "Therefore, I do
not think I will be blamed for this one."

"That one is still not solved," Christabel said. "Does he have a family
who needs to avenge his death?"

"From what Suri said," I said, knowing full well she might not be a
reliable source, "he was from a 'no account', her words, family. They
might want revenge but they do not have any hope of getting it."

"Just be careful," Captain Star Runner said.

"I will be careful," I said. "I have no intention of becoming another
victim."

There was silence.

I said, "You do need to promise one thing, Captain Star Runner."

Star Runner's whiskers twitched. I rarely use Star Runner's title when
speaking directly to her.

"You need to promise me you will not leave Transfer Point Seventeen
without me."

"I promise," Captain Star Runner said. "You are my responsibility."

"Remember that," I said.

I hoped she would. I was afraid, but how could Captain Star Runner ever
consider leaving Lystra without me.

<div id="star-runner-narrates" class="section">

Star Runner Narrates
--------------------

I was so pleased to be reunited with Pru Dillow and Salim. They brought
me up-to-date with their activities and I did the same,, skipping
quickly over the events on Planet X. They did not need to know.

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

Of course, these two also had a need to know. Had Star Runner shared
with them, it would have learned some important information which
effects the story. I do not know how it affects the story right now, but
I need to figure that out.

</div>

I was pleased also that Detective Ronnie Camberwell seemed to get along
with them all right, especially Pru Dillow. I did not know how to talk
to Detective Ronnie Camberwell right now and she was so out-of-sorts. I
knew she was trying to adapt to life aboard the ride in our current
circumstances, but she was clearly suffering from depression. I was glad
to see she had made an effort with her appearance. Ronnie is not a
conventionally beautiful Terry. She is large, strong, awkward in her
movements. Nevertheless, she can look competent and assured. She almost
pulled that look off when she met my friends.

The arrival of Suri Nam was another matter. I did not think I should
turn her away. Her family did have some importance on the Transfer
Point. Christabel was still trying to find out how

all the family connections worked in Lystran society. We had a few
textbooks but they were quite limited. A *Who's Who* would have been
extremely helpful. Christabel suggested I leave the decision up to
Detective Ronnie Camberwell.

The sexual innuendos were not lost on either Christabel or me. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell was being manipulated. We surmised that Detective
Ronnie Camberwell knew this and struggled valiantly to resist Suri
Nam's wiles, but in the end, Detective Ronnie Camberwell had to
agree. There really was not a choice.

Christabel reviewed the contract when it came and altogether we studied
the information Suri Nam had provided.

The contract and the assurance was simple. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
could return to the ride when her work was finished. What finished meant
was not explained. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was indentured to the
Nam family until she finished her job successfully. She would be
housed, fed and clothed during this period. She would be paid a small
sum when her work was completely, enough the contract said to make it
possible for her to "resume a regular life." We did not know what that
meant but it sounded like boiler plate language. Remuneration was not
the point here. Indenture was a bitter pill to swallow, but Detective
Ronnie Camberwell swallowed it for, as she said, "the good of the
order".

When we finished with the contract, we moved onto the murders.

This felt like old times. Detective Ronnie Camberwell, Christabel and I
were working together on a case. For the moment, I put aside that
Detective Ronnie Camberwell would be going onto Transfer Point Seventeen
to interact with Lystrans and especially Suri Nam. That was later.
This was now. I was still basking in the pleasure of seeing Pru Dillow
and Salim again. They were doing well. We had made a more formal
arrangement to keep in touch. We had been through some very difficult
times together. That bond was still there even in the good times. I was
very happy.

Two men have been murdered several weeks apart. They are both young.
Neither of them comes from an important family.

</div>

1.  The manner of their deaths is similar which is causing them to be
    grouped together. Because there are only two of them, a pattern
    cannot be established.
2.  The Nam family is concerned about their deaths because
    unexplained deaths dishonor the family.
3.  Policing is not an honorable profession because the police come into
    contact with disreputable people who are neither virtuous nor
    typically successful. A successful crook may be respected for his
    cleverness.

"That is a pretty thin line," Christabel observed. "You are a petty
criminal until you can string together enough crimes to be successful."

"It sounds a lot like the Pharaoh Star System," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said. "You are a petty pirate until you strike it big. Then
you might be considered reputable and legitimate businesses come to you
for their legitimate work."

"True," Christabel said. "But the environment in the Pharaoh Star System
sounds very different than Lystra."

"I am getting that impression. Lystra is very class conscious. Are the
respected families government-appointed or related to a royal family or
what? Do you know, Christabel?"

"It appears to be a patronage system," Christabel responded. "If you
once did something for the ruler, you got a position. If you did not
screw anything up, you kept your position and became entrenched. Once
entrenched, you have opportunities to continue to stay entrenched."

"According to what I am reading here," I put in, "The Nam family may
be a big deal here on Transfer Point Seventeen, but in general, transfer
points are not high level appointments. If they were planet side, they
would be significant. You are dealing with a big goldfish in a little
lake."

"A big fish in a small pond," Detective Ronnie Camberwell corrected.

"That is what I said," I said.

"Close enough," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, going back to her
study.

1.  Both men worked in the maintenance areas. They were both techs but
    they did different jobs. One worked on sanitation and one worked on
    air supply. This looks more like the area where they could be killed
    as there are fewer security cameras and no one around them.
2.  Their friends and co-workers were questioned. No one had noticed
    anything strange in the days before their deaths. Neither man had
    been acting peculiarly. Neither man appeared worried or distracted.
3.  Nothing appeared to be stolen on their bodies or in their lockers or
    in their dormitory.
4.  The men lived in the same dormitory. Dormitory assignments are
    random and are determined by gender and age rather than job
    descriptions.
5.  One man had worked on Transfer Point Seventeen for seven months
    while the other one had worked here for three years.
6.  Although the men knew each other, they were not friends.
7. Forensics talks a lot about the weapon used but cannot provide hair
    samples, fingerprints, in fared data, extraneous DNA--nothing at
    all.

"There is really not a lot to go on here," Detective Ronnie Camberwell
concluded.

"The weapon information is jumbled," Christabel said. "Did you notice
that?"

"It sounds like gibberish," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I cannot
even figure out what the weapon is."

"That is my point," Christabel responded. "That is why I called it
jumbled. Would I be correct in stating that they do not know what killed
these men?"

"That would be incorrect," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said after
rereading the reports. "They do not have the weapon. They know of a
weapon that would kill in this way. They cannot imagine a weapon that
kills in this way. In other words, they could not build or make a weapon
of this sort. They have never heard of anything like it. Therefore, they
do not know what killed these men."

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

I am on the brink of violating one of Ronald Knox's commandments for
writing detective stories. He characterized it as inventing a poison
that does not exist. I am not describing a weapon that does not exist.
It existed in this universe. The overworked police force or forensics
laboratory just have not seen it because it belongs to a race they do
not know about.

</div>

"Are there any weapons in your databases that match the description of
what this weapon did?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked us.

"No," Christabel said promptly.

"Can you speculate on what sort of a weapon it might be?" Detective
Ronnie Camberwell asked. From what I have read in these reports, the
weapon is the only lead I have. I can re-interview everybody. I can
visit the scene of the crime, but I do not think I will learn anything
new. I cannot see the bodies. They have been recycled already which is
standard procedure on a space station."

"Specific cells in the brain were disrupted," Christabel said. "These
cells govern both personality and morality. Essentially, the weapon
destroyed who these men were. When that part of their brain died, their
whole body shut down."

"I do not understand," I said. I had been following the conversation
very closely, but this made no sense to me. "I would have thought the
two men would have gone on living in a vegetative state."

"I would have thought that, too," Christabel said, "but that is not what
happened to them."

"It is as if this weapon is a spirit killer," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.

"The weapon killed their spirit and then they died?" I asked. "How can
this happen?"

"The ancients would have called it a soul killing weapon," Christabel
said.

We all were silent for a time. It sounded like a terrible weapon

"So the question is," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "who has such a
weapon and why did they use it on these two men? They do not seem
dangerous men."

"Were they just random victims?" I asked.

"Just two of them?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked. "I would have
thought there would be more killings if someone was running around with
a soul killing weapon. This makes no sense at all."

"I do not think a soul killing weapon is possible," I said.

"Nothing else fits the facts," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

I thought of Sherlock Holmes, but I did not bring him up. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell had criticized me for making a fictional comparison
back on Planet X.

Christabel and I discussed Planet X in our back channel. Could this be a
Tigerfu weapon?

"Or something the People of the Rainbow Sky have or something the
Followers of the Stars have," Christabel added. "Our records are so
incomplete. I think it is fair to say this is not a Lystran weapon."

"What can we share with Detective Ronnie Camberwell?"

"Not much," Christabel said. "We do not have much to share."

"What are you two talking about?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Us?" I asked.

"Don't try to look innocent." Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded
irritated. "You two are always talking about something."

"It would appear," Christabel said before I could answer, "that this
weapon is made by or was made by an advanced race. It is either a new
weapon newly created or an old weapon created a long time ago."

"Or an old style weapon newly revived," I put in. This displeased
Christabel. She thought I was pushing Detective Ronnie Camberwell in a
direction of inquiry we were still keeping secret.

"So maybe someone on the transfer point acquired this weapon and was
trying it out on some low-level people," Detective Ronnie Camberwell
said. She looked very unhappy.

1.  The weapon is from a long time ago and belongs to an advanced race.
    Someone found it and says, what the heck. I'll try it out on
    somebody who is working alone in the maintenance area. Bang. They're
    dead. Wow. Let me try this out again. Bang. Wow. This other guy is
    dead, too.
2.  Someone found a book. Wow. Here's a nifty weapon. Let me build it.
    How does it work? Let me try it out on some tech alone at his job.
    Bang. It works. Let me do this again. Bang. Yes, it still works.

"I don't like either scenario," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "The
killings cannot be random. These are not tests or even examples. If they
were examples, we would have to be told what the deaths mean. No one has
done that."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell shook her head. "I am willing to posit a
weapon from beyond the Lystran empire. It is a strange and complex
galaxy. All sorts of races have learned all sorts of things. Some races
have been around a long time. They may have invented things we know
nothing about. It is a dangerous to go on an assumption like this in
police work, but I do not see an alternative. Nevertheless, I think
there must have been a reason why these two men were killed. If I can
find the motive, I may be able to find the killer. My biggest problem is
that this is a transfer point. The killer could have left the transfer
point weeks ago. These are cold cases. They are hard to solve."

"Are you saying it is hopeless? What about your contract?" I asked. I
was a little panicky. I did not want Detective Ronnie Camberwell held on
Transfer Point Seventeen indefinitely because she could not solve the
case.

"I need to to find a way to know these men." Detective Ronnie Camberwell
paused, twirling a lock of hair in her fingers. With this gesture, I
knew she was thinking. "I need to inhabit them. The only way I can do
this is to go under cover as one of them."

"How?" I asked. "You are not a Lystran. They would not allow you to work
in the tech area if you do not know anything about it. You are not a man
anyway."

"Suri always says I am a man when she is displeased with me, if I have
done something awkward or not to her liking&lt;" Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said slowly. "If I am right, and tell me if I am right or
wrong, Christabel, I could pass as a Lystran man. I have the height and
the build for it, I think. Suri is coming back to take me to her
seamstress to get fitted with appropriate garments. If I tell the
seamstress to also make me men's wear, I am sure I can apply as a
general purpose worker and get a space in the same dormitory. I am an
off worlder stuck here by the war. They are short-handed. I need work
because I will starve without it. Given all this, I may just pull it
off."

"I think you are right," Christabel said. "Lystran male clothes are also
not form fitting. If you can hide the fact that you are not anatomically
male, you should fit in."

"That will be easy enough," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I am a
Terry. They have never seen a Terry male."

I was surprised Detective Ronnie Camberwell used that word, Terry, but
Christabel pointed out to me along our back channel that Detective
Ronnie Camberwell could use any old word for her species and not be
corrected. Terry was a word she was familiar with if she needed to use
it quickly in all manner of situations.

"I need to pull a few things together," Detective Ronnie Camberwell
said. "Suri is coming for me soon."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell stood up. "Captain Star Runner," she said,
"I need you to promise me something."

"What is that?" I asked. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was being very
formal.

"Captain Star Runner," Detective Camberwell said, "I need you to promise
you will not leave Transfer Point Seventeen without me."

"I promise," I said quickly. "I would never leave without you, Detective
Ronnie Camberwell."

And I meant it.

[Chapter Fifteen: A Visit to the Seamstress](#id26){.toc-backref}
=================================================================

<div id="the-author-thinks-aloud" class="section">

The Author Thinks Aloud
-----------------------

Here is what I know right now. The characters do not know this yet.

Here is what I know right now. The characters do not know this yet.

1.  The case reports Captain Star Runner, Detective Ronnie Camberwell
    and Christabel looked at in the previous chapter (I wish I knew how
    to make a lnk to that chapter in restructured text) have been faked.
    Ronnie will not be able to find out any information about the two
    dead men. They do not exist.and therefore their deaths never
    happened.
2.  he soul killing weapon does not exist.
3.  Ronnie will figure this out when she thinks to look at the report
    filed on Heracles Beja's death. It will be identical to one of the
    reports she received.
4.  The simple explanation of Heracles Beja's report is that Suri
    Nam copied the first report without making any changes,
    expecting no one to read it carefully or correlate it with the two
    dead maintenance workers.
    1.  Suri's class consciousness did not let her see either the
        maintenance workers or Heracles as important enough to be looked
        at carefully.
    2.  Suri did not want to draw attention to herself and copying the
        report would allow the report to be filed on a lower class
        person and thus get him off the radar.
5.  am wondering if someone from the Followers of the Stars or the
    Tigerfu killed the two maintenance workers. Either race would stand
    out on Transfer Point Seventeen. The Tigerfu might be a better bet.
    The killer might have been able to disguise himself as a Lystran.
    The bear-like Followers of the Stars would have difficulty doing
    that. On the other hand, one of the members of either race could
    have fingered one of the Lystrans. Prince hat is a manipulator and I
    like him for the part of using others.
6.  The People of the Rainbow Sky and the Followers of the Stars are
    working together to cause the collapse of their old enemy the
    Lystran empire. If they can use the People of the Golden Sun to do
    it, so be it. In this way the Followers of the Stars continue their
    exploitation of the Tigerfu.
7.  If all this is true, it will affect Captain Star Runner and
    Detective Ronnie Camberwell differently.
    1.  Ronnie will throw her lot in with the Tigerfu.
    2.  Captain Star Runner will return to Half Moon Bay Space Station
        to try to remain neutral during the conflict.

<!-- -->

1.  This story will not have a happy ending. There is too much betrayal
    and too many secrets.
2. A future novel could look at what happens when Ronnie and Captain
    Star Runner come across each other during the war or after it.
3. Captain Star Runner will reveal all to The Czarina who will blog
    about it for her readers back in the western spiral arm. The royal
    archivists for the Pantheran Empire will sensor her report. They are
    uneasy about all this chatter coming out of the Primary Arm.

Ronnie Narrates
---------------

Suri looked me over critically.

"You cannot wear those clothes here," she said. "I will need to take you
to my seamstress to have all new clothes made. You need to look like a
Lystran woman."

"No," I said.

I waited for her to explode. She did.

"No," I said again firmly. "You hired me to find out who killed these
men. I intend to do that. I cannot find out dressed like a Lystran
woman. The men will not talk to me. I cannot go into the maintenance
areas where they worked. I cannot poke around, stand around, look around
the way I need to in order to solve this case."

"You will scandalize everyone dressed like that," Suri insisted. Her
manner was all-knowing and condescending to me.

"I do not intend to dress like this," I explained to her. "I intend to
go to your seamstress and have her design clothes that will make me
looked similar to the way those men looked. I intend to get a bed in
their dormitory. I intend to hang out where they hung out and possibly
get a job in maintenance."

Suri was speechless.

"You cannot do that," she finally said. Her shock was great.

"I must," I said. "If I cannot do these things, I cannot solve your
case."

"The Morality Board will not like it," Suri said weakly. "I will be
implicated, too."

I saw immediately the Morality Board had great power on Transfer Point
Seventeen. That was good to know.

"Does the Morality Board approve of murder?" I asked, pressing my
advantage.

"Certainly not." Suri was regaining her air of indignation.

"Which is a greater offense, murder or cross-dressing?"

Suri made a rude noise. "What do you think?" she asked.

"I am asking because I am unfamiliar with your mores," I said. "If
murder is a more serious offense, then I will use whatever skill I have
to uncover the murderers."

"There is only one," Suri said quickly, then regretted her outburst.

"Only one?" I questioned. "How do you know?"

"I do not," Suri said, trying to cover her early mistake. "I just do not
want to think there are two such degenerates aboard the transfer point."

I did not tell her the likelihood the murderer was still around was
small.s With a war on, the murderer could easily enlist and kill all he
wanted.

"So are we agreed that I go to the seamstress and get my man clothes?" I
asked. "You always say I am just like a man. I should pass well enough."

Grudgingly, Suri agreed. Throwing those man references in my face
pleased her. Acting on her retorts made her very quiet. Her volatile
nature confused me. I wondered if Suri was acting out some juvenile
attraction through fained dislike.

I always find the dock areas of space stations grubby. They are cold,
too. They smell of machinery, lubricants and paint. The spacers who are
coming and going often seem furtive, intoxicated or just creepy. It
always amazes me that Captain Star Runner who is so fastidious about her
appearance, feels so at home in these places.

I was not prepared for the interior of Transfer Point Seventeen. My
first shock was how grimy everything looked.

I have to admit my only acquaintance with space stations is the
Alexandria Space Station, the gateway to the Pharaoh Star System and
Half Moon Bay Space Station. The Alexandria Space Station is bright and
sparkling and to the extent possible, gives the traveler an sense of
openness and airiness. Tara Lee Harrington, my former lover and space
station security chief, told me that passengers coming from and leaving
Ptolemy City could typically afford such luxuries. Their ticket prices
paid for the wider corridors and higher ceilings and warmth.

I had been to a number of pods on Half moon Bay Station. Some were
newer. Some were older. Some were designed on a more open floor plan
while others were quite enclosed. They were all well-maintained, a
condition of being part of the larger governmental organization that was
Half Moon Bay Space Station.

There was a smell. It was not the odor I associated with Suri. All races
have their own odor. If Captain Star Runner was present she could have
identified it. The longer I stayed aboard the transfer point, the more I
realized it was the smell of cooked food and waste. The sanitation
systems could not scrub strong odors out of the recycled air. The smells
made their way into fabric and, I am convinced, the walls, floors and
ceilings of the place. It was unpleasant. I tried not to show I noticed.
Suri did not seem to notice it.

The seamstress, too, was a surprise. Her shop was a small room. We
entered it through a shop that sold hardware or fittings. I was never
sure exactly what all the parts and pieces were for. That a seamstress
worked behind a parts store seemed very strange to me. The seamstress--I
never knew her name--was not related to any of the people in the parts
store. She simply rented this room. As I got to know the transfer point
better, I learned there were lots of rooms that could only be entered by
transversing at least one other room. Not all rooms had access to the
corridors.

The seamstress was probably in middle age. Her skin was mottled. her
hands were arthritic. Her teeth were mere stumps and some were missing.
She had large bald spots on her head. There was something wrong with her
feet. She had difficulty walking. The word *hag* came to mind.

When I asked Suri about her, she simply said, "She has five children,"
as if that explained everything. Maybe it did. Two were the norm.
Lystrans give birth to two children at a time. Each child nurses from
three mammary glands on one side. I wondered at if the seamstress had
had three children born at once or two sets of two and one set of one. I
never found out.

I did find out that having more than two children was thought to be
morally suspect. It had nothing to do with multiple partners or even
some sort of population control. It was thought to be over indulgent
like drinking too much or eating to much. I suppose it was classified as
gluttony.

The seamstress did not look like a glutton. She looked like a used up,
falling apart woman who needed my pity not my disgust.

I never understood how or why she became Suri's seamstress.

Suri insisted I explain my requirements to the seamstress. It was as if
Suri wanted no part of this plan. nevertheless, she stayed through all
the measuring. The seamstress also put in an order for boots,
undergarments, toiletries other necessities. She spent a lot of time
poking at my breasts. These are not large. The seamstress worried about
how to strap them. I did not see why she bothered. The standard wear for
young men hid any hint of femininity I have. Lystran fashion causes them
to have large amounts of fabric around their hips, especially in the
back, and gathered tops that puff out in the front as if they might
start crowing at any moment. The extra padding in the posterior region
turns out to be necessary as most seating on the transfer point is
uncushioned and very cold.

I realized belatedly that all the seamstress's poking and prodding was
for Suri's enjoyment. I wondered if that was by prearrangement or
whether the seamstress knew Suri's predilections. Perhaps all young
women were the same. I never found out.

When I finally was dressed in one of my new outfits, I studied myself
critically in the mirrors. It was hard for me to tell how well I could
pass. The clothes felt strange on my body and they certainly did not
flatter me at all. Later, when I observed the other men of my
approximate age and assumed social standing, I discovered what a good
job the seamstress had done. I never had the opportunity to tell her.
What I would not know for a while was how attractive she had made me.
Both men and women looked. Their looks were often lascivious. Their
grins or dropped eyes bewildered me. I had never before been the such an
object of attention. I did not enjoy it. I wanted to hide. It made me
rethink the attention I give beautiful or sexy women.

[Chapter Sixteen: Man About Town](#id27){.toc-backref}
======================================================

I did not know what to expect. I got some basic information and set
about being a man from a backward planet in the Lystran Empire. That was
not really as hard to do as I had originally thought it might be. Most
of the young men in the dormitories were just like me--the undercover
me. They came from villages on poor planets. They came to a transfer
point hoping for better employment and a way to send money back home. Or
they came looking to escape their pasts. They found themselves in
low-paying jobs, owing money to the controlling families which kept them
indentured with no way of redeeming themselves. They lived in cramped,
drafty dormitories, eating poor food with no medical care. If they were
too sick to work for too long, they lost their space in the dormitory.
They lost their food card. They turned into criminals, living in the
bowels of the transfer point. Or they committed suicide, too ashamed to
beg or steal. The controlling families, with a war on, found many
recruits for the military. Although their servitude was not reduced, the
pay and living conditions were said to be better. They signed up and
shipped out. The controlling families called them cannon fodder. I
wondered how many of them would survive the war no matter who won it.
All in all it was a depressing business. I was cold and tired much of
the time. My work was menial. My questions were met with disinterest and
grunts. I could find no one who had ever heard of either man. After a
while, I began to think they had never existed.

One day when I was sitting at a filthy table choking down a watery bowl
of vegetable soup--if there were any vegetables in the soup they were
peelings only--I began to ask myself what I was accomplishing. I decided
to spend the afternoon going over my reports. If I did not show up for
the afternoon shift, my pay would be docked. I had credit of my own. I
would survive. With so many men going off to the front, shifts were
often poorly staffed and men went missing all the time.

I could find nothing in the case files that gave me any ideas. Because I
was at an impasse, I took out the report I had been given on Heracles
Beja. His report seemed very much like the others which was very odd. I
ran a comparison. Except for a few items like physical description, date
and place of birth, Heracles Beja's report was identical to that of one
of the dead men. How could this be? Heracles Beja was killed with a ray
gun. I knew that. I had seen the body. That was the conclusion the robot
concierge came to as well. We never found the ray gun, but that meant
nothing. It is a big planet and the ray gun could have gone into a
recycle, off a balcony or into the river with no one the wiser. I knew
it had not come aboard Captain Star Runner's ride. Star Runner checked
for weapons. Whoever had killed Heracles Beja had disposed of himself
and his weapon.

But this report bothered me. I read it over several times. It was marked
with all the official virtual seals it was supposed to have, but I
realized the only possible conclusion was that it was a forgery. If
Heracles Beja's report was a forgery, could these two other reports be
forgeries, too?

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

This is basically hogwash. It will move the story along for now, but
Detective Ronnie Camberwell needs a lot more than thought to make this
and a few more conclusions reasonable. I will leave it for now because I
have no idea what this process should look like at the moment.

</div>

I needed a few answers. I went looking for them.

Fortunately, I was given clothes for work. My clothes from the
seamstress were still in new condition.. I put them on and went looking
for the police department.

By now I had a much better idea of how this transfer point worked.
Transfer Point Seventeen was very old. It creaked along, but many parts
of it were broken or out of order. There was not a regular maintenance
schedule for non-essential services. The store I went through to reach
the seamstress, for instance, was a parts store--parts to repair almost
anything--cook stoves, refrigeration units, motorized carts, furniture,
lighting, air circulatory, heating and cooling systems. If there was a
machine on the transfer point, this store and many others like it had
parts for it. People went from store to store, sifting through bins,
trying to find the right part.

I found the police room--you could hardly call it a station--behind a
store which appeared to sell used home items. I found bedding,
furniture, lighting fixtures, trays for automatic cookers. Later I
learned it was a consignment store. People were selling off their goods
to pay their bills. Pawn shops were also plentiful. I wondered if
everyone was selling, who was buying.

I showed my reports to the policeman on duty. I had no idea what his
rank was. He gave the reports a superficial review and said, "Not ours."

"Not yours?" I asked. I felt stupid after I said it, but what could he
mean? "If they are not yours, whose are they?"

He shook his head. "They are our seals," he said, "but they are not our
reports."

"How do you know?" I asked.

"They do not have the right signatures and the right watermarks," he
said. "Someone sold you fake reports."

He made no offer to file a complaint. I did not inquire about doing so.
The police official seemed uninterested. He did not even suggest I pay
him to do so. Bribery was quite common on the transfer point. I never
was sure if it was legal or just not offense anyone worried about. I
thanked the police official for his time and left the police room.

I found a shop where I could get something warm to drink and considered
my options.

What did I know?

1.  The report I was given and which looked to the non-initiated to be
    real, was not.
2.  The report on Heracles Beja was identical to that of one of the dead
    men killed here on the transfer point.
3.  No one knew either of the two workers killed here on the transfer
    point.
4.  Could I safely conclude the men were as unreal as their case files?
5.  Why? What was all this about?

My first thought was misdirection. The men were invented to throw
someone off the track. Off the track of what? Who was supposed to be
thrown off the track? I was hired to, ostensibly, help the police force
but clearly the police force was not involved because the two men had
not died. They were fictitious.

What point was served by having me investigate? I had not seen Suri
Nam since I left the seamstress shop. She had indicated, rather
brusquely and with her usual disregard for anyone else's feelings, that
she was disassociating herself from me. I could turn my findings over to
the police. They were expecting my report.

But when I had gone into the police room, they did not know who I was
nor did they care.

I was someone's dupe, but I did not know whose. Did I care? Should I
just walk away and go back to Captain Star Runner's ride? And do what?

We had worked together on the case files--Christabel and I had worked on
the case files. I corrected myself. Captain Star Runner and I had not
interacted much at all for a long time. I started going back before I
received the contract to protect Suri Nam. I lived on Half Moon Bay
Space Station. I worked with Jack Whicher. Captain Star Runner lived
aboard her ride and came and went running her high-speed courier
business. We saw each other when Captain Star Runner was docked at the
space station for any amount of time. As the months progressed, our
conversations had lagged. We had less and less to say to one another.
Our lovemaking had been perfunctory and less often. I found myself not
wanting to go to restaurants in my pod with her. I did not want to be
known as the humanoid who hung around with a Pantheran. Captain Star
Runner was well-respected as someone who could give you fast turn
around, but she did not fit in well at Half Moon Bay Space Station. She
was an outsider, far more so than I was. She docked her ride on the
seedier side, preferring low rates to classier facilities. Her ride was
well-maintained, of course, but dockside ambiance did not interest her
at all.

I liked a better standard of living. I liked the people I met who lived
and worked on the station. In a very real sense, we were not spacers. We
just happened to live on a space station. We did not enjoy space travel.
The long runs through hyperspace either bored us or frightened us. We
liked our creature comforts and for the most part, we could get them. We
could even spend time in the garden areas, pretending we were planet
side. I had a favorite bench in a little grove of trees. Right now I
could not remember their name or where they came from. A week living on
transfer Point Seventeen had robbed me of that beauty.

The weapon was not a soul killer. This transfer point is the soul
killer.

Then I remembered. The weapon was not real.

So what was the point of all this?

One of the dangers of police work, especially the private work i do, is
becoming emotionally involved. At first, I was in danger of becoming
emotionally involved with Suri Nam. Perhaps I had become involved.
Perhaps I still was. The ability to walk away is very important.. Jack
Whicher told me that all the time. It might work well in novels to have
the investigator solve the crime on his or her own time, but practically
speaking, that makes no sense. There are other jobs and others things to
do. If you are invested in one outcome or another, you are bound to get
into trouble.

I knew all that, but there was no where else to go and nothing else to
do. I resolved to get to the bottom of this mess.

To that end, I went in search of Suri Nam. Had I not, had I returned
to Captain Star Runner's ride, this story would have had a very
different ending.

</div>

<div id="chapter-seventeen-asking-questions" class="section">

[Chapter Seventeen: Asking Questions](#id28){.toc-backref}
==========================================================

<div class="admonition note">

Note

I do not know how to go about writing this chapter. Ronnie wants to get
to the bottom of things. How will she start going about it?

</div>

My first order of business was to figure out who to talk to first. The
logical person was Suri herself.

Tracking Suri Nam down was not an easy matter. I continued to
maintain my male identity. This made for social complications.

-   Did I have an appointment
-   Was I on the approved list?
-   What was this in reference to?
-   Did I have a referral?
-   Did I have a letter of introduction?

The man asking me these questions was not so much a footman or a butler
but a bouncer. He was quite intimidating. I had no idea if Suri was in
at the complex of rooms called her home. The local word was compound. I
simply did not go away and kept asking to see her on a private matter.
Apparently that was not sufficient.

I stood in one of Transfer Point Seventeen's unadorned and grimy
corridors facing a non-descript metal door. There was no doubt in my
mind it was reinforced with a sophisticated locking mechanism. I could
not see the man I was speaking to, but I was certain he could see me via
the security cameras placed at strategic points around the door, above
me and in the corridor itself. The door looked old like everything on
Transfer Point Seventeen. At some point in its history there was an
attack or someone tried to force their way in. The door was scorched.
Jagged lines scored its surface and there were numerous holes. I could
not tell how deep either defacement went, but I could not see light
through any of the holes.

"You will have to give me something," the bouncer was saying, "or this
conversation will end and it will not be restarted."

What could I say to get this man to contact Suri? I took a deep mental
breath and took a chance. What else could I do?

"I represent Heracles Beja," I said.

"Heracles Beja is dead," the man said dismissively. "You cannot
represent him."

"OH yes I can," I said, suddenly feeling my role. "I represent Heracles
Beja's interests and his part of the intellectual property from Planet
X."

The bouncer hesitated. He would have no intimate knowledge of what
happened on Planet X or perhaps even what intellectual property there
might be. "Very well," He said. "I will determine if it would be
appropriate to see Suri Nam on this matter or whether it would be
better for you to speak to someone else in the family."

That was not what I had intended, but I was committed. Perhaps a family
member would be more helpful than Suri had been. She had a lot of
explaining to do.

After a long wait, the door swung open. There was a lot of squealing
noises. Did anyone on this Transfer Point know anything about greasing
hinges? Why did they use hinges anyway? (Later I learned that everything
on the transfer point was mechanical so that a power failure would not
interrupt the opening and closings of doors. This meant, of course, that
no area could be quickly sealed against an air leak or other calamity.
This would have dire consequences for Transfer Point Seventeen later.)

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

A dramatic possibility is an attack on the transfer point. There could
be a significant breach with many deaths. I am not sure if I want to go
down that avenue but it does make for some excitement. It may be a good
way for Detective Ronnie Camberwell to discover Captain Star Runner has
left the transfer point despite Star Runner's promise to her.

</div>

I was escorted through several rooms before I went through another
scorched, scored and shot up door into another section of the compound.
Clearly this was a more lived in area. There were actually carpets on
the metal floors.

I entered a small sitting room. Suri Nam stood in its center.

My escort allowed me to enter while remaining in the doorway.

"You may leave," Suri instructed him.

"But Celser," he began.

"I said 'leave us'," Suri snapped. He left, but did not close the door
behind him. Suri went to it quickly and very quietly closed it.

"What are you doing here?" Suri said, whispering and seeming to hiss at
me.

Having heard a Pantheran really hiss, her attempts at outrage did not
impress me. When Captain Star Runner hisses, she arches her back and
puffs up all over. It is quite an impressive sight. Suri Nam on the
other hand seemed far more frightened than angry. Her anger was only a
cover for something else--fear most likely.

"I came to report," I said. "Your bouncer was quite unsympathetic to my
attempts at not drawing attention to either myself or you."

"You should not have come here." Suri Nam scolded me.

This cloak and dagger approach was getting tiresome. Transfer Point
Seventeen was certainly tiresome: the food, the air, the whole look and
feel of the place. I yearned for Half Moon Bay Station. Was that now
representing home to me? I was not certain. Perhaps it only represented
what security I ever felt I had.

Suri said, "And you should never mention Heracles Beja, especially
here." She literally stamped her foot in frustration.

"We need to talk," I said, folding my arms in a Lystran gesture of
absolute immovability.

"Not here," Suri Nam repeated.

"Then where?" I asked. "It has to be now."

"I cannot leave right now," Suri Nam said in that same low urgent
voice. "There will be too many questions."

"Where then?" I asked. "When?"

"Number twenty-eight maintenance tunnel," she whispered. "You know the
place."

I did. At the appropriate time, I went there.

And that is when Suri Nam pulled the ray gun on me.

I do not know what the emergency in her household was or if it was a
well-played means of getting me to maintenance tunnel twenty-eight.
Either way, Suri Nam was holding a ray gun on me.

"You know too much," Suri Nam said. "I cannot afford to have you
asking questions."

I wanted to ask her many questions. I wondered why she thought she had
to kill me. I had learned enough in my short time on Transfer Point
Seventeen that her family was important enough to keep her out of
trouble but not very important in the scheme of things. She could be
shuttled off somewhere where her youthful indiscretions could be
overlooked and then forgotten. After the birth of her two baby pair,
could assume the role of a pampered Lystran matron and everything would
go on as usual. I did not have to die. Why did she think I did?

You would think being in an awful maintenance tunnel with a slightly
hysterical woman pointing a ray gun at you would be terrifying. I
thought about getting into being terrified, and then I channeled the
male Lystran I was pretending to be.

"Put that stupid toy down," I said as firmly as I could. "The ricochet
could be heard and it could bounce back and hurt you."

Suri waved the ray gun around which was quite frightening.

"I know how to use this," she insisted.

"I am certain you do," I said. And then all at once I knew the answer.
It was the answer Captain Star Runner gave me back on Planet X.

"Why did you killed Heracles Beja," I asked calmly.

It is true, you know. Criminals really do like boasting about their
exploits. If I could keep her talking and learn her reasons, perhaps
there was a way out of this impasse.

"He was going to publish my work," Suri Nam said, seeming to forget
about the ray gun altogether. It started to lower. I breathed a little
easier.

"I only brought him along as cover and to do some of the harder bits. He
wanted to publish all my work and take credit for it."

"That sounds like a problem," I said, wanting to keep Suri talking,
wanted to follow her tangled logic.

" I knew him in school, of course," Suri continued, "He was bright
enough. I figured he could be useful, you know, doing all the grunt work
out there. You know what it was like."

"Yes," I said. "Then what happened?"

"He took all my notes," Suri said, outrage coming into her voice. She
was becoming strident. "He copied them out himself, creating a field
notebook in his own writing. I had to destroy it, of course."

"Of course," I agreed, knowing that no such thing had happened. Suri
Nam had attached herself to a rising star in the archaeological
field. When his work was complete, she had copied his work and then
killed him for her own ends.

"And do you have the notes?" I asked, hoping that was the right thing to
say.

"You bet I do," Suri said. "I do not have them stored in any of the
linked systems. I do not want my work to get out until I am ready to
publish. People will be very surprised when I publish my work."

"Why is that?" I asked. Keep her talking. Whatever happens, keep her
talking. I did not dare move toward her though she had just about
forgotten she was holding the ray gun. I could not move fast enough to
wrench it away from her. I was strong enough. I was just too far away.

"I am not ready to publish it yet," Suri Nam said. "I have more work
to do on it. People will be very surprised."

"Really?" I said. "Why is that?"

"Because everybody thinks those structures are only a couple of thousand
years old. They are much older than that. The people who built them are
really, really old."

"Who are they?" I regretted my question as soon as I had asked it.
Suri's demeanor changed. She brought the ray gun back up on me.

"Never mind who they are. You do not need to know. You do not need to
know any of this."

I saw her finger move. She was trying to unlock the safety.

I tried to be ready. When she looked down to unlock the safety, I needed
to move fast. It is a complicated lock. It is designed that way so the
ray gun does not go off prematurely. That makes it a poor choice for
killing people as Suri was trying to kill me.

Suri looked down.

I moved.

Just as I reached her and she released the safety, the alarm sirens
bleared.

"This is not a drill. We are under attack. Report to your designated
locations. This is not a drill. We are under attack."

Suri Nam screamed. Whether she screamed because I grabbed her arm or
whether she screamed because of the siren bleating over our heads I do
not know. She wrenched away from me and ran, quickly disappearing from
view.

"This is not a drill. We are under attack--"

I scooped up the ray gun and I ran, too. I did not run toward any
designated area. I ran toward the docks and Captain Star Runner's ride.
This might be our chance to escape.

I ran through corridors, pushing past people--all sorts of people. I did
not care if I bumped them, if they went down. I just ran. Barely able to
catch my breath, I ran onto the long platform where the spaceships were
docked. I ran to the place where Captain Star Runner's spaceship was.

And it was not there. There was an empty space. The ride was gone.

Stupidly, I ran up and down the platform, looking at all the spaceships.
The bronze disc was not there. There were only torch ships.

I ran to the dock office Someone was there. I asked where Captain Star
Runner's spaceship was.

"Left three days ago," the dock office worker said disinterestedly.

"Where did she go?"

"I have no idea," the dock office worker said. "I was not on duty then.
I am closing up now. You should be at your designated area."

I was thunderstruck. Captain Star Runner had left Transfer Point
Seventeen without me. How could she do that? She had promised. She had
not even communicated with me about it.

The Transfer Point shook violently. I staggered, knocking into the wall.
The dock office worker, who was walking past me, put out his hand to
steady me, then the space station lurched again. We fell in a heap onto
the floor.

"Emergency personnel report to section thirty-five, thirty-six and
thirty-seven," instructed the loud speaker over our heads. "Sections
thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty and forty-one are open to space.
Refrain from proceeding to those sections."

I tried to think where those sections were."

"The upper echelon living areas," the dock office worker gasped. "That
is where they would have reported to."

That meant many of the upper class families were dead. Perhaps Suri
Nam was one of them.

"Do you know who is attacking us?" I asked. I was still in my role as a
Lystran from somewhere else in the empire.

We were getting to our feet.

"I heard it was the People of the Golden Sun," the dock office worker
said.

We left the dock area together. I figured it did not much matter where I
went. If I had a designated area, I did not know what it was. This was
not my fight, but I was here. What else was there for me to do?

The dock office worker had said the attack was by the People of the
Golden Sun. That made no sense at all. Lystra was at war with the People
of the Rainbow Sky and so by definition, the People of the Golden Sun
should be their allies. Had something changed? I was not following the
conflict particularly closely. I really was not that interested so long
as the fighting war stayed far away from my location.

I was turning a corner when it happened. The dock office worker had run
ahead of me, anxious to get to his designated area. I was just following
along, wondering where I was going and what would happen when I got
there.

Suddenly a door opened and someone stepped out. Someone very odd
looking. For a split second I saw the head, the ears, the whiskers.
Could it be Captain Star Runner? Of course not. This being was erect.
The color was all wrong. What sort of a being was this? Was this the
enemy? Was I about to be captured? Tortured? Killed?

I stepped back. The being stepped in front of me and said, "Detective
Ronnie Camberwell. I have been looking for you."

<div id="chapter-eighteen-a-change-in-my-perspective" class="section">

[Chapter Eighteen: A Change in My Perspective](#id29){.toc-backref}
===================================================================

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

1.  By rights, I should switch to Captain Star Runner's perspective on
    this story. I know where Captain Star Runner goes, to the People of
    the Rainbow Sky. What I still do not know is why.
2.  I also have the problem of knowing what to do with Salim and Pru
    Dillow. They provide a little information, but for their appearance
    to make sense, they need to go along with Captain Star Runner and
    have a meaningful part to play in the narrative.

</div>

I just stood in the corridor and stared at the alien. It was quite tall
and quite thin. It had four arms, two on each side. It was striped and
as I had initially thought, it had a cat's face. Whereas Captain Star
Runner's face more closely resembled a domestic cat, this individual's
face was flatter as if a human being was trying to look like a cat. It
had whiskers and cat ears on top of its head. It did not have green
eyes. Stupidly my mind said, it does not hunt at dawn and dusk. It does
not stay out at night.

"We do not have much time, Detective Ronnie Camberwell" the alien said
to me in accented basic. This was not the meow-sounding speech of a
Pantheran. "Do you have the reports?"

I stared at the alien, speechless.

"I cannot read minds, Detective Camberwell," the alien said. Its tone
was calm which was very odd. The transfer point was shaky. Alarms
continued to sound. Announcements repeated over and over.

"Reports?" I finally repeated. "Suri Nam has the archaeological
reports. She copied them from Heracles Beja.

It was the alien's turn to be silent. I could not read the expression on
its face. Its whiskers were twitching.

"I know nothing about archaeological reports," it finally said. "We want
the other reports you have."

The transfer point rocked violently. We were both thrown to the corridor
floor. Then the gravity went off. More alarms sounded. More instructions
came over the loud speakers.

"Come with me," the alien said. "The station is breaching everywhere. We
must get back aboard ship."

I am a total loss at moving when there is no gravity. The alien knew how
and used its arms to pull us from handhold to handhold, eventually
getting us into an open area where it could launch itself from ceiling
to floor in a way that made sense. We were back in the docking ring. We
got aboard a spaceship and left Transfer Point Seventeen none too soon.
When we were fully clear of it, the space station blew up.

I saw this on the view screens in the control center of the spaceship. I
was strapped into an acceleration couch. The spaceship was going as fast
as it could toward a jump gate.

"Why did you blow up the transfer point," I asked. I was glad to be
alive but I was certain I was a prisoner.

"We did not," the alien, who appeared to be the captain, replied. "It is
coincidental that we arrived when the attack began."

"I do not understand," I said.

"We will explain everything to you when we are at cruising speed in
hyperspace," the captain said. "Right now we need to concentrate on
getting clear before we are noticed."

Their own language was rapid and in a low register. I could tell by the
view screens when we inserted into hyperspace. There were a number of
course corrections. Then there was quiet.

"We will go to our discussion room," the captain said.

The captain and my rescuer detached themselves from their acceleration
couches. My rescuer detached me and assisted me in the weightless
spaceship to navigate to a very comfortable conference room.

"This cabin functions as our discussion room, our recreation room and
our dining area," my rescuer said. "You can see our galley facility on
the far wall. We hope our fare will be eatable for you. Our medical
officer will do some tests to determine if it is and what can sustain
you if it is not."

That sounded quite dire to me.

"We had not intended to take you off the transfer point," the captain
explained. "However, the attack changed all that. It would have seemed
cruel to abandon you to your fate."

"And what is my fate?" I asked. Starvation sounded like a possibility.
Test subject might be another prior to starvation.

"Your 'fate', as you put it, is up to you," the captain said. "You are
not our prisoner. You are our guest."

"Could we begin at the beginning?" I asked. "Do you have water? And who
are you and what do you want that you think I have?"

"I am Harnoff," the captain said. "This is Janker. We are Tigerfu."

"I have never heard of Tigerfu," I said.

"It is a long story," Janker said. "We will have time to go into our
history, but the short version is that we are people who once lived on
the world known as Planet X."

"but you did not want the reports from Planet X," I said.

"What reports?" Captain Harnoff asked. "I do not know about any reports
from Planet X."

And so we began our exchange of information.

Perhaps it was the shock of first being almost killed by Suri Nam or
the attack or the betrayal of Captain Star Runner or the destruction of
Transfer Point Seventeen or everything that had happened or it had
nothing to do with any of it. I liked these aliens. They were kind and
courteous. I could not eat most of their food, but they were generous
with what I could eat and the medical officer could synthesize some
vitamins and minerals to keep me going. She knew what food stuffs of
theirs I could eat when they reached civilization, as she put it. I
could thrive on their worlds. I liked that idea.

"We are engaged in responding to forces here in the Primary Arm,"
Captain Harnoff said. "We were not a part of the attack on the transfer
point. We believe that was initiated by the People of the Rainbow Sky.
They are old, very old, enemies of the Lystran Empire."

"I did not think they were actively participating in the war," I said.
"I thought they were trying to contain the People of the Golden Sun."

"The propaganda the People of the Rainbow Sky put out is that they are a
benign elder race that only want to maintain the status quo," Janker
said. "If we are fair, and it is often hard to be fair, the People of
the Rainbow Sky are more concerned with their own interests than that of
the rest of the Primary Arm. But of late, and I mean for several
centuries, they have become more active again. Even this would not have
been worrying except that they have revived their connection lately with
our old enemy, the Followers of the Stars."

I stared at them.

"the Followers of the Stars are in the western spiral arm," I said. "I
:   personally have never met one of them, but I know several people who
    have."

This intelligence surprised both of my new friends.

"Who?" Captain Harnoff asked.

I was frightened. They both realized this. Had I said too much?

"We are just surprised," Janker said. "We are curious that the Followers
of the Stars had contact with outsiders."

"People in the western spiral arm discovered a toxic chemical site from
a long-ago war," I said. "One of those people was a fuchsia-colored
PPantheran," I said. "We learned the site was from a genocidal war
against the Trollolu. The Pantheran, my on and off lover, accepted a
commission to go to the Primary Arm. I returned to my own world."

"We have heard of this fuchsia-colored pantheran," Captain Harnoff said.
A Pantheran had not been seen in the Primary Arm for many thousands of
years."

"Were they common here?" I asked.

"Our histories tell us so," Janker said. "They are fearsome warriors.
They once were the pilots of all space faring vessels. They built the
original jump gates."

"They were maintained by the People of the Rainbow Sky," Harnoff said.
:   "I did a report on them for school when I was a juvenile. They were
    introduced into the Primary Arm by the Followers of the Stars."

"They were instrumental in driving us from our home world," Janker said.

"Our home world is the planet you call Planet X. The Followers of the
Stars took it over after we were driven out."

"That was twenty thousand years ago, right?" I asked.

"About that," Janker said. "How do you know? The People of the Rainbow
Sky and the Followers of the Stars have made great efforts to eliminate
even the knowledge of our race."

"Because of the work Heracles Beja was doing there recently," i said.
"He was analyzing pigment samples on a stone wall."

"Are those the reports you were speaking of?" Janker asked. "The ones
you thought I wanted."

"Yes" I said. "What reports did you want."

"Two men were killed on Transfer Point Seventeen," Harnoff said. "An
unusual weapon was used."

"No one was killed," I said. "I investigated. No one knew who these men
were. They never existed. The weapon described was an impossibility."

Janker twisted his ears. I had already learned this was a negative.

"The weapon does exist," he said. "That is why we want the reports."

I shared what I had with them. They were quite excited and murmured
together over them for some time. I was very tired. I asked to be
excused.

The medical officer, her name was Suchee, showed me to a quiet and
semi-private space. I stretched out and began to cry. Suchee sat with
me, making low rumbling noises which I took to mean comfort.

"What is wrong?" Suchee finally asked when I had stopped crying.

"She left me to die," I said.

"Who left you to die?" Suchee asked.

"Captain Star Runner," I said. "She promised she would not leave without
me and she left me there to die. If Janker had not come looking for me
and took the time to save me, I would be dead. We were not getting along
very well. But that was no reason to let me die."

"We do not know all the facts," Suchee said. "I know you are frightened
and feeling all alone. Any reasonable person would feel this way after
what has happened to you. This is especially true of humanoids in my
experience. The only comforts I can give you are these: You are safe
here. We will make sure you can live somewhere safe when we get back.
Our route takes us deep into Tigerfu-controlled space. There is no war
going on there. The second thing I can tell you is that without the
facts, we do not know if Captain Star Runner left voluntarily or not. It
may not have been her desire to abandon you. Perhaps she thought she
could get back in time to save you. Perhaps she thought you would be all
right while she was away. The attack was well-executed. It was a total
surprise. We monitored all the communications."

"Was there any communication from Captain Star Runner?" I asked. It was
a silly thing. How would they know. Were they there at the right time to
find anything out?

"I will have Janker check," Suchee said. "Can you give him some more
information?"

"I think I can,," I said.

"Then we will look and see," Suchee said.

And she left me alone to sleep.

When I awoke, Janker had some information for me.

[Chapter Nineteen: Sitting by a Fountain](#id30){.toc-backref}
==============================================================

The Tigerfu brought me to a place they called the Habitat. This was a
large domed complex on a planet far from the war zone. My rescuers did
not bring me all the way here. Several different very kind Tigerfu
shepherd me on my journey. At all times they told me and treated me ass
their honored guest. I was touched by their consideration and their
gentle ways. It seemed strange to me that these quiet and patient people
were aggressors in a war.

I gained very little information on my long journey. They listened to me
tell my story of betrayal over and over. When I asked questions, they
told me I would have my questions answered when I reached the Habitat.

I imagined the Habitat to be a complex space station, something like
Half Moon Bay Station, with myriad pods held together with rings of
docks for shipping. The reality was far nicer and a pleasant surprise.

When I say the Habitat was a domed city, I am not quite accurate. It is
a series of domes, each of which can be self-sustaining if the others
breach. As a result, even the urban areas have large productive gardens.

Consistent with their gentle ways, the Tigerfu decided to be
vegetarians. They grow their own food very carefully without undue
chemical interventions. Every Tigerfu learns how to cultivate a small
garden so that the entire race is able to step in to feed themselves in
case of disaster.

"Once, my teacher said, "we were a highly specialized society. When our
disaster came, we almost failed because so few of us knew the basics.
Food sufficiency was one of the core studies we decided to be part of
every Tigerfu juvenile's education. We also added basic programming and
the use of hardware and software for communication. Each Tigerfu must
select a specialty. We monitor so that the specialties are
well-balanced. For example, we make sure we have medics. We also make
sure we have people to repair our domes, produce potable water, process
our waste. Sometimes our specialty choice is turned down because we have
so many with that specialty. We give assign the juvenile to a needed
specialty. If later they want to add to their proficiency, we allow
that, but they must maintain their certification in their first core
competency. It is a matter of pride among us if we have certification in
several areas.

"What about you? What are your specialties," I asked. I had no doubt he
had more than one.

Gemall smiled. "I am a juvenile teacher, of course. My specialties are
water management and disaster relief. I work several weekends a year in
the public works section and I train regularly in disaster relief. From
time to time I go off planet to help in a natural disaster. There were
terrible floods on one planet three years ago."

Gemall and I walked daily in the gardens. When Gemall was not available,
I walked with my Counselor, Dibenan. Both of these Tigerfu spent many
hours with me. When I was not with them, I had my own room, arranged as
I wished, with a large window overlooking a quiet courtyard. There were
benches and a fountain with a few potted growing things. Some were
vegetables while others had flowers. Vines were on trellises overhead.
The fountain added humidity to the air. The plantings consumed carbon
dioxide and returned oxygen. It was a pleasant place to sit. The other
residents of my building gave me expressions of friendliness, but did
not intrude. I ate with them at the common meals. As they spoke in their
own language and as my ability to converse in it was still very minimal,
I enjoyed their company without participating in their interactions.

I learned these were students. It was thought that although they were
younger than I was, they could provide a supportive atmosphere and
interacting with me would be helpful to them as well.

In a way, I was a pedagogical tool. In another way, I could provide
value as part of the society and I appreciated the opportunity to give
in my limited way. Although the Tigerfu had a very good safety net, they
also expected everyone to contribute as they were able. If you could
contribute and did not,, you were shunned. Social pressure led to
conformance in many cases.

"Is there much crime here?" I asked Gemall one day.

"Some," Gemall said. "Why do you ask?"

"I am a police officer by training," I said. "I have also done private
investigations and worked as a body guard. I was wondering if my skill
set is useful here."

"Yes," Gemall said. "I would like to tell you, as a member of a
different race, that we had no crime here, but you probably would not
believe me even if I said it."

I smiled. Gemall and Dibenan were beginning to recognize this facial
expression. I was still woefully inadequate at reading Tigerfu body
language. They still needed to tell me when they were joking which they
did often.

"No, I would not believe that any society had gone past crime," I said.
"Temptation, greed, pride--all what we humans called deadly sins--seem
to exist in all societies I know about except the Fungusian Network."

"No you are correct," I said. "I would not believe you."

Gemall made a gesture with her paw arms. I knew this was a smile. "You
will have to speak and understand Tigerfu much better before you can
operate in law enforcement."

"I take your point," I said. "I must redouble my efforts."

Later that day Dibenan asked, "How are you finding living here among
us?"

I thought for a while, watching the fountain splash down on some
fantastical water creatures.

"I miss my home," I said. "I miss my friends. And despite her betrayal,
I miss Star Runner. But missing them aside, I am quite comfortable
here."

"But--" Counselor Dibenan prompted.

"But it is still very unreal," I said. "It is like being in a movie. I
keep thinking it will end. I will find myself removed from my residence,
removed from knowing anyone like you or Gemall, and among some brutish
aliens where I cannot trust anyone."

"Trust is a major issue for you," Dibenan said.

"Yes," I said.

"It has been a major issue for you from your juvenile period. Yet, from
what you have told me, there have always been people who have stepped in
and renewed your trust in others. Mr. and Mrs. Parge raised you when
your parents could not, for example."

"I have not made wise choices as an adult," I said.

"Let us test that assertion," Dibenan suggested.

"All right," I said. "Let me provide you with a list and you tell me
what you think."

"That is a good idea," Dibenan said.

So I began:

-   Captain Star Runner
-   Tara Lee Harris
-   Gyllian Romeres-Lujo
-   Tamara
-   Josh

I provided Dibenan with background on each of these and a few others who
are unknown to the readers of these chronicles.

Dibenan listened with her full attention, a common trait among Tigerfu.
She was quiet for some time. Like me, she studied the fountain. Unlike
me, she probably saw more of the essence of fountain than I did.

"Relationships are much like this fountain," she finally said. "There is
practicality. The fountain provides humidity. There is also beauty.
Sometimes the water catches the light just right and there are tiny
rainbows. We hear the sound of the splashing water and it soothes us. I
look at the sea creatures and remember our myths and legends about them.
This gives me joy and perhaps even a bit of sorrow that they are
fictional representations of greater truths.

"Relationships can also be annoying. The sound of water can become
irritating. The water can be cold and wet and make us uncomfortable."

She paused.

"Relationships are not all one way and not all one way all the time.
There are uncomfortable bits worked into joyful bits worked into routine
bits worked into sorrowful bits. They ebb and flow and circulate like
the water in this fountain."

"Betrayal is like letting the plug out and all the water draining out,"
I said. "There is nothing beautiful in that."

"Not beautiful exactly," Dibenan said, "but sometimes it is necessary to
turn the fountain off, drain the water and thoroughly clean and repair
the fountain before starting it up again. Part of what I think you need
to wrestle with is possibilities."

"But I do not want to--" I began.

"Hush now," Dibenan said in her gentle way. "Tell me if any of these
individuals intended to betray you?"

I thought about this. I tried to think honestly about this.

"Having different goals, having different priorities from you is not
betrayal," Dibenan continued. "Tara Lee, your former human lover, wanted
a monogamous lifelong relationship with you. You were unwilling to give
up your affection for Captain Star Runner and the excitement of being
with an alien in order to meet Tara Lee's desires. You have been in
conflict with both Tamara and Gyllian Romeres-Lujo because of their
special relationship with Star Runner and with their different
objectives, their loyalties to different institutions."

"You are painted me as quite a selfish person," I said. I knew I sounded
petulant.

"Are you a selfish person?" Dibenan asked.

"I do not think so," I said. "I have strong opinions about what I like
and I do not like."

"Do you think of yourself as a negotiator, as a person who is willing to
change for the sake of another's happiness or needs?"

I was silent. Dibenan did not speak while she waited for me to say
something.

"I have always wanted to be a police officer," I said.. Both Mr. and
Mrs. Parge were very keen on what was right and what was wrong. Police
work can be very good for a person who likes the world ordered in that
way. They were very scandalized by my relationship with Captain Star
Runner. In their minds, associating with an alien in an intimate way was
obscene. Consorting with a Pantheran was disloyal to the human race. I
think I have always been afraid that their assessment of Star Runner
would be accurate."

"And every time Star Runner behaves in a manner consistent with your
foster parents' ideas about aliens and Pantherans in particular, you
pull back from your relationship," Dibenan said.

"But Star Runner promised," I said. "She promised not to leave me on the
transfer point."

"Have you kept every promise you ever made?" Dibenan asked.

I did not answer her. Of course I had not kept every promise I ever
made. Who had?

"Unless you discover Captain Star Runner's reason for leaving the
transfer point without you, you cannot know for certain. In our
teachings, the Tigerfu wise ones say we should always give the other the
benefit of the doubt. We should always imagine the other is trustworthy
and has failed due to circumstances beyond their control. We try to find
the most helpful explanation for someone else's actions or to find some
good in what they did. If Captain Star Runner left prior to the attack,
perhaps Captain Star Runner is still alive. If she had stayed, she might
not have been able to rescue you and save both of you. As it is, you are
alive and very likely, Captain Star Runner is, too."

"But if she loved me, she would have stayed," I said, tearing up again.

Dibenan waited for me to get control over myself.

"And if you loved Captain Star Runner," she asked in her soft voice,
"would you have left her ride and gone aboard Transfer Point Seventeen
with the Lystran woman?"

That was a very hard question. I did not answer Dibenan. We sat for a
time in silence. At last Dibenan said, "It is time for me to leave. I
will talk with you again tomorrow."

I watched her leave the courtyard by the gate onto the walkway between
buildings. She walked purposefully, not looking back. I wondered if I
had let her down. As a counselor, letting her down did not seem
possible. But as an individual, did she see me as a selfish, immature
alien who did not strive for the higher ethics the Tigerfu practiced? I
did not know. I would have to ask Gemall in the morning. Was it possible
that I held everyone else to a higher standard than I was willing to set
for myself?

Confused and with a heavy step, I left the courtyard, too, and prepared
for the evening meal.

As either penance or my first step on the path to better living, I
concentrated on the conversation around me and spoke a few words. I was
greeted with encouragement, appreciation and yes, some humor, at my bad
pronunciation and grammar. I think at one point I called our plate of
beautifully arranged and steamed vegetables engine grease.

[Chapter Twenty: Visitors Come to the Habitat](#id31){.toc-backref}
===================================================================

Armed with my decision to interact more with my new environment, I
explored the area around my living quarters and the park. I was living
on a campus. Schools of varying kinds operated here. Gemall advised me
not to go beyond the school grounds.

"Why?" I asked. "Am I under house arrest?"

"You are not," Gemall explained. "The problem is you are humanoid. We
are fighting a war against humanoids. Your identification clearly labels
you as not one of the races we are fighting, but people get excited and
they may not take time to correctly identify you."

I was astonished. "From all you have told me, I thought the Tigerfu were
more enlightened than that."

Gemall made the humor gesture. "We like to think we are," he said.
"However, Tigerfu are no different than anyone else. We accept people
who look like us. We are suspicious of those who do not. You do not."

"You spoke of my identification," I said. "What is that?"

"The arm band you wear," Gemall said. "We all wear them. It identifies
who you are over the net."

"You have a net?"

"Of course," Gemall said. "We were wondering when you would ask about
it."

"Who is we?" I asked.

"Dibenan, me and a few others that supervise your integration into our
society," Gemall said.

"I do have a link," I said. "It has not been integrated with your net."

"We are looking at that," Gemall said. "So far we do not see a way to
connect the two of them."

The armband could not directly interface with my brain as it is so
different than a Tigerfu brain. However the technologists were able to
fabricate an interface for me consisting of a screen I could carry with
me and I could speak to it. It was not as private as a brain-connected
link, but we set it up to understand basic galactic so I could interface
with it easily. It could also understand Tigerfu so I could practice my
language skills. If I slowed the speech down, I could also understand
most of what it said in Tigerfu. Many of the sounds were hard to
distinguish. Part of the problem for me is that Tigerfu has some very
high sounds and some very low sounds. They are virtually beyond my
ability to hear.

In my explorations, I found a lovely bistro

at the edge of campus. Gemall had explained that I had a modest stipend
which also covered my room and board"Every Tigerfu is entitled to this
stipend," he explained. "We thought it was the simplest way to allocate
your expenses. Of course," he added in his serious voice, "you are
expected to contribute to society as you are able."

"I plan to do just that," I said. "We have spoken about law
enforcement."

"Yes, we have," Gemall said. "We are exploring that and some related
possibilities."

No matter how many additional questions i asked, I could not find out
more about this mysterious we or what related possibilities might mean.
When I brought the matter up with Dibenan, she only said that "we"
referred to a committee on which both she and Gemall were members and
related possibilities simply meant looking at tasks I had the aptitude
and interest to perform.

"That is still a ways down the path," Dibenan had said. "You need to be
far more competent with your language skills and your grasp of Tigerfu
society."

To this end, I walked into the bistro.

People of course noticed me. I selected a beverage and a popular snack.
I fumbled a great deal connecting my identity and its associated
financial identity to the payment system, but I managed it after several
tries. No one became impatient. I realized that in a busy market my
fumblings would annoy people. My alien status would upset them. Gemall
and Dibenan were right. I was nowhere near ready to

<div class="system-message">

> take on Tigerfu society as a whole.

I carried my treats outside to a bench under a tree with large red
blossoms. To me, it had a delicate aroma. To the Tigerfu, it had an
overwhelming fragrance. The trees were prized for their fruit and so
they were common throughout the campus.

"Here you are, Ronnie," a Tigerfu voice said.

I looked up. Two Tigerfu were approaching me. I did not recognize them.
To me, it is hard to tell one Tigerfu apart from another. I was still
learning how to use my wearable link to read their identification
information. These two Tigerfu were military.

"We're Janker and Suchee," one of them said.

I of course got them mixed up. They made the humorous gesture and I
laughed. No one was offended thankfully.

I was delighted to see them and told them so.

"What are you doing here in the Habitat?" I asked you. "It is a long way
from the front."

"We are on leave," Suchee explained. "We came here to see our family."

"The grandchildren are growing cubs," Janker explained. "If we are away
too long, we hardly recognize them."

"You are a couple, then?" I asked.

"For many years," Janker said. "We have three grown cubs and four grand
cubs."

"Wonderful" I said. "I had no idea."

"We did not want to burden you with more than you could handle," Suchee
said, sitting down next to me.

"Is the tree a problem?" I asked. "I know many find its blossoms very
strong."

"Yes, they are very strong," Suchee said, "but they are one of the
scents of home. Janker and I have been sneezing a lot. Aboard ship we
have so much filtered out of our atmosphere. But we enjoy all these
scents so we just sneeze and delight in being home."

Suchee patted my hand.

"We understand you are doing well here."

"I am learning," I said. I wondered if Janker and suchee had access to
the committee. If they did, they probably would not tell me. They had
not even told me they were a long-term mated pair.

"The committee thought it was best if we came to visit you," Janker
began. "We have some news for you."

What sort of news could this pair have for me? I was confused.

"We have word of your Captain Star Runner," Suchee said. "I know her
well-being is important to you."

Was it? I was no longer sure.

"I am in military intelligence," Janker explained. "That was why we came
to Transfer Point Seventeen in the Lystran Empire. We were tracking down
a lead. It turns out you were the most expedient person to ask. You had
the reports we were looking for to add to our intelligence."

I frowned. "The reports were entirely bogus," I said. "I do not
understand how they could have helped you."

"The reports were not bogus," Janker said.

"The men did not exist," I said. "I could find no evidence concerning
them."

"Oh, they were real enough," Janker said. "They were agents of the
Followers of the Stars--not willingly, of course, but they were feeding
information to the Followers of the Stars. When the Followers of the
Stars had all the information they needed, the agents self-terminated."

"With the soul killer?" I asked, incredulous.

"Is that what you call it?" Janker asked, surprised.

"It seemed the only name for the brain disruption," I said.

"It is a good name," Janker said. "I should recommend it with credit to
you."

"But why could not anyone give me any information about these men?" I
asked.

"They were totally forgettable people," Janker said. "They were not to
make friends or stand out in any way. After their deaths, the records
were updated to eliminate them. With no proof, you were bound to
discount their existence."

"Janker was very lucky," Suchee said, patting my hand again. "You had
all the records."

"And," Janker said, "not to be too patronizing, you were storing them in
a way I could easily access them."

"I thought my security was state-of-the-art," I said a little
defensively.

"Not for us," Janker said. He almost sounded like a Pantheran.

Speaking of Pantherans, I asked, "You said you had news of Captain Star
Runner."

"Yes," Janker said. "She and her ship are in our custody."

"You captured her ship?" I asked. "Why?"

"She was carrying some very important communications for the People of
the Rainbow Sky," Janker said. "We learned this and intercepted her.
Wisely, she did not fight us but surrendered, believing we could not
crack the codes. We did."

"Is Star Runner all right? What are you doing with her?"

"At present, we are evaluating Captain Star Runner and her artificial
intelligence," Janker said. "Our code experts are going over the
programming. We have had to call in some biologists and zoologists as
well. It is a very complicated network."

"Why are you doing this?" I asked. "Captain Star Runner depends on
Christabel to survive."

"Christabel?" Janker made a gesture indicating confusion. It was a
gesture I had learned to read and was working to sign adequately.
Lacking an extra set of arms, it was quite difficult to execute but
quite useful to learn.

"Christabel is the name of the AI," I said. "Christabel was built by the
Fungusian Network."

"And the Fungusian network is a part of the Pantheran Empire," Janker
said. He gestured uncertainty.

"No," I said. "The Fungusian network is outside the Coalition, the group
of races the Pantherans control. The Fungusian network is independent.
You might be able to contact them. They have no love of the Pantherans."

"but they designed Captain Star Runner's network," Janker said. "Why
would they do that?"

I executed the thinking, wait a little while, gesture badly. Should I
tell them what I knew? Would it help or hinder Captain Star Runner. As a
prisoner of the Tigerfu, I thought information might help her so I
plunged in.

A long time ago, the Followers of the Stars oversaw a number of races:

-   The Trollolu
-   the Pantherans
-   the Featherote
-   the Fungusians

The Trollolu educated the three other races. Together, they built a
space faring consortium:

-   the Featherote built the ships.
-   The Fungusians designed the operating systems and software to
    control them.
-   The Pantherans designed star runners to pilot them. They also
    engineered other Pantherans to work other aspects of the ship.

Then the Trollolu went to war against the Followers of the Stars and
were completely annihilated. The Followers of the Stars retired from the
galactic scene and each of the remaining races continued their alliance.
The Pantherans became an empire, conquering the Featherote and a number
of other races. They call it a Coalition so that these races can believe
they were not conquered. The Fungusians have not been conquered. They
exist independently.

Janker and Suchee were indicating disagreement.

"What is wrong?" I asked. "Have I gotten something wrong? Do you know
this history?"

"We know some of it," Janker said. "I will have to inquire from the
history department here on campus some of the particulars you mention.
These are unknown to me. Although I am a student of history, it is not
my core competencies. Here is where I think I disagree with your
conclusions.

"The Followers of the Stars did destroy the Trollolu. They nearly
destroyed the Tigerfu. When you say the Followers of the Stars retired
from political and military activity, they may have pulled back from
your galactic arm, but they continued to be active in this arm for some
time. They have also been absent from the scene, as you call it, but
they have reasserted themselves. They are working with their old ally
the People of the Rainbow Sky to control all the other races in the
Primary Arm. It seems the People of the Rainbow Sky felt challenged by
us and others and called on the Followers of the Stars to help. Captain
Star Runner has been their go-between. From our initial analysis of the
software aboard Captain Star Runner's vessel, she is definitely
controlled by them."

"There is pernicious software in her system?" I asked. I was shocked the
Fungusians had not identified it and I said so. "How is she being
compromised?"

"We have found the change logs," Janker said. "The Fungusians are
meticulous. We can follow their work. It is a very different methodology
than ours, but our scientists can make sense of it. Then there are other
changes which are not so clear. These seem not to have been made by the
Fungusians."

"Captain Star Runner said the People of the Rainbow Sky did an upgrade
to her and to the artificial intelligence. Star Runner said there was
some kind of genetic drift that had taken place that made it deleterious
to her to be in the presence of the People of the Rainbow Sky. Star
Runner could not see them properly, only colored hazes."

"We thought it looked like their programming," Janker said. "We could
not understand it. I will tell the biology team to investigate this."

He spoke rapidly in Tigerfu and gestured just as quickly. I could not
really follow what he said, but I heard Star Runner's name several
times.

"This is very useful intelligence," Janker said to me. "What seems to be
very clear in that Captain Star Runner believes she is working
independently while in fact she is being controlled from the outside. We
are trying to figure out what to do. It is a serious ethical question."

"We hoped you might help us," Suchee said. She continued to touch my
hand. "You have intimate knowledge of Captain Star Runner and may help
us chart the right response to this situation."

"You are free to say no," Janker hastened to add. "As much as we would
like your help, you, too, are a free agent. We recognize that you may
not want to help or be involved with Captain Star Runner anymore."

"We do not need an answer right away," Suchee said. "You can think about
it for a little while. Janker," she made a gesture of affection, "wants
an answer right away--you can understand this, I think--but in reality
it can wait for a few days."

We said some inconsequential things after this. Then they went away. I
continued to sit on the bench and tried to think and sort out my
emotional response to all of this. I was not surprised when Dibenan sat
down next to me with another beverage and more substantial food."

"You missed the midday meal," she said. "I would think you would be
hungry."

"I have been trying to figure out what to say to Janker," I said, fully
believing Dibenan had been updated.

"And what have you been thinking?" Dibenan asked.

"I am first trying to really understand the overall situation," I said.
"With Captain Star Runner's explanations, I believed the People of the
Rainbow Sky were the good guys here. There is another component called
the People of the Golden Sun who are the bad guys."

"There is no group called the People of the Golden Sun," Dibenan said.
"They do not exist. They are an invention of the People of the Rainbow
Sky."

"But Captain Star Runner was captured by the People of the Golden Sun
and fought a battle against them. She was decorated for her work."

Dibenan was silent. I realized she was reaching out to the net.

"The People of the Rainbow Sky invented the People of the Golden Sun for
propaganda purposes," Dibenan said. "it is an excuse for war. It is an
excuse to rally worlds that have been increasingly restless under
burdens of taxation and tribute."

"It was quite real when Transfer Point Seventeen was blown up," I said.

"The war itself is real," Dibenan said.

"And the attack against the Rabbit merchants?"

"We had reached out to them to join us," Dibenan said. "The People of
the Rainbow Sky destroyed their planet."

I thought my brain was going to explode. All this contradictory
information.

"It is a matter of trust, is it not?" I asked Dibenan. "You and I have
talked a lot about trust. Have you been trying to sway me to your side
or have you honestly wanted me to explore this topic?"

Dibenan made a gesture of surprise and, I thought, chagrin.

"You can be very perceptive," she said. "You cannot function in our
society without trust. You find it difficult to trust. We have talked
about that and I think you will agree my points have merit. There is
probably no real way to ascertain who is telling you the truth about the
bigger picture. We cannot fact check for ourselves."

"And Captain Star Runner? What is the ethical issue there?" I asked.

"We have always thought of ungendered Pantherans as creatures," Dibenan
said. "They are controlled by their artificial intelligences. If you
control the artificial intelligence, you control them. They function in
a network.

"But here we have Captain Star Runner. Although she, more properly it,
must have access to an artificial intelligence for some basic biological
monitoring and memory management, this Pantheran is functioning
independently. There is no supervision of this creature's
decision-making except for the patches added by the People of the
Rainbow Sky. This might mean that this Pantheran is not a creature but a
person. The fact that you and Captain Star Runner had or have a
relationship speaks to the Pantheran's person hood."

I knew I was making an irrevocable decision. I knew there would be no
turning back. But I also knew a number of disparate pieces of my life
were coming together.

I said, "Captain Star Runner is a fuchsia-colored Pantheran. These are
rare in their history. Most ungendered Pantherans are pastel-colored.
Fuchsia-colored panther ans have always made a significant impact on
panther an society. Captain Star Runner has always wondered what" (I
almost said her, but I decided to give Captain Star Runner its own
preferred pronoun) its mission is. I think it is to demonstrate that
ungendered panther ans can be people. They can have self-determination.
They are not tools to be discarded."

"I will pass your sentiments on to the team evaluating Captain Star
Runner," Dibenan said, making ready to get up from the bench.

"No," I said. "I will join the team. I want to speak with Captain Star
Runner. It will need to participate in its own rehabilitation. The
Fungusian network will also have to be contacted to assist with any
changes that need to be made to Christabel. We have an opportunity here.
I do not want it to be wasted."

Dibenan was taken aback. I knew that I had never been this forceful or
definitive around her. But she also made a gesture of pleasure and
acknowledgement.

"Well done," she said. "I will put your recommendations forward as well
as your desire to be on the team."

"Not my desire," I said. "My insistence."

"Agreed," Dibenan said.

I thought my request would be denied. I thought the bureaucracy would
take forever. I was wrong.

"Your application for membership on Captain Star Runner's team has been
accepted," Gemall told me the next day. "You will travel with Janker and
Suchee. Janker is already a member of the team. Suchee has been
reassigned to assist you in any way necessary. We also anticipate
Captain Star Runner will need help adjusting as well. If all goes
according to plan, you will both come back here at a later date. The
Habitat is a good location for integrating into our society."

"No," i said. "Captain Star Runner will not come here. This is a planet
with great expanses under the dome. Captain Star Runner needs to be
aboard its ride, integrated with its artificial intelligence. When
Captain Star Runner travels out of range of a good working integration
with the artificial intelligence, it must use a bridge AI. It is less
than satisfactory. Also a method for maintaining Captain Star Runner's
mind and body needs to be planet side. it is all quite complicated and
quite alien to it. Star runners are designed to be part of their rides.
In a real sense, the ride is a part of them. it is a shell that can be
changed, much like animals who grow and shed their shells and skins, but
they need their rides. If Captain Star Runner is to be a person, it must
needs to be aboard its ride and actively traveling on the space ways.
Any other life would not be natural."

Gemall was silent.

"I had not understood that," Gemall said. "You need to compose a
statement about this to the rest of the team. They are not thinking this
way as I understand it. You will have a great impact."

"Or I will be ignored," I said, having a bad feeling about this.

"No, I do not think so," Gemall said. "Janker and Suchee are very
positive about your contributions. The scientists are not ideologues.
They are just interested in the science and," Gemall made a gesture of
emphasis "and they do not want to do any harm whether to a person or a
creature."

And so it was that I left the Habitat several days later with Janker and
Suchee and traveled to where Captain Star Runner was being held. Along
the way, Janker told me more of what he had learned.

"We are going to a research facility," he told me in the common room
aboard our military fast ship. Military fast ships are small vessels
which ferry military personnel from one place to another inside Tigerfu
space. They are not heavily armed. Their function is speed. "Captain
Star Runner is aboard its ship, but we have disabled the engines. My
latest report is that it is quite agitated and believes our questions
and examinations are intrusive and meant to disable it."

"If you thought you were being held prisoner," I said, "You would think
the same things. This would be especially true if you believed you were
being held by the enemy."

"That is the odd thing," Janker said. "We are not convinced Captain Star
Runner thinks we are the enemy."

"But I thought you said, or someone said, Captain Star Runner has
patches from the People of the Rainbow Sky that control it."

"Yes, in some regards, but the work that has been done most recently
suggests these patches are very specific and do not affect Captain Star
Runner's overall thinking. We are hoping that you can sort a lot of this
out for us. Captain Star Runner has not been very forthcoming to us."

"have you learned where Captain Star Runner went after it left Transfer
Point Seventeen?" I asked. "I would like to get clear about that before
I see it."

"Yes, we do," Janker said. "That has to do with the patch. The Pantheran
received a communication from someone it knew from its previous visit to
the Blue Fire Star System, one Sam lam Seah. Captain Star Runner could
not resist the summons so it went. The summons removed Captain Star
Runner from the area of Transfer Point Seventeen and thus kept it safe
when the transfer point exploded. The summons was real enough. We
intercepted Captain Star Runner after its visit to the Blue Fire Star
System."

"And we suspect," Suchee added, "that leaving you behind was something
Captain Star Runner had no control over."

"Nor did your presence aboard Captain Star Runner's ship known to the
People of the Rainbow Sky. Retrieving you was not part of the summons,"
Janker explained. "If it was, you would not have been left there.
Captain Star Runner has been very distressed about you."

"Have you told it I am alive and well?" I asked.

"No," Janker said.

I make Tigerfu gestures badly, but I deliberately made my gesture of
anger slowly and carefully.

"That is cruel," I said. "You tell Captain Star Runner immediately that
I am well and looking forward to visiting it. Causing needless distress
is unethical behavior."

Janker made a gesture of contrition and sorrow. "You are correct," he
said. "I deeply regret our behavior. Our only defense is that we did not
know if you wished to be revealed to the Pantheran. We will correct this
immediately."

During my next rest period, I lay awake in my bunk, wondering what this
reunion would be like. I was adamant that Captain Star Runner should be
treated like the person it was. I was less sure how i wanted our
personal interactions to be? Were we still lovers? Was I just a friend?
Had I become Captain Star Runner's advocate?

Maybe, I thought, it was not as important as I once thought it was to
distinguish these three roles. What was important right now was doing
the right thing, the ethical thing, for Captain Star Runner. After I did
that, maybe I would never see it again. Maybe I would just return to the
Habitat and find some meaningful work to do.

As I fell asleep, I thought, the Tigerfu had already won me over. I was
thinking and acting in a very different way than I ever had before. I
hoped I would be happy with myself when I was finished with this
project. .

[Chapter Twenty-One: Back On board Captain Star Runner's Ride](#id32){.toc-backref}
===================================================================================

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

1.  I think the timing in this first draft of the novel is very off.
2.  As this novel has developed, I think in some very significant ways
    this is Detective Ronnie Camberwell's story.
3.  Earlier I wrote in a note that this is a story of betrayal. I think
    I am wrong about that. This can easily be shaped into a story about
    trust.

</div>

I was anxious to see Captain Star Runner. The software engineers were
busy on another project so Janker, Suchee and I left them to their work
and made our way to the docking ring where Captain Star Runner's ride
was quarantined.

When we approach it, Janker took out his override. I touched his hand
arm which held the device.

"We should ask permission to go aboard," I said. "If Captain Star Runner
is a person, that is the polite and respectful thing to do."

"Agreed," Janker said, putting the override device back into his pouch.

Since Tigerfu have fur and do not wear clothing, pouches are the
preferred way of carrying gear around. Some Tigerfu use vests. Others
have adopted wearing backpacks. There are very conventional designs for
these adaptations and there are trendy ones as well. I use a cross-body
bag.

I went to the ride hatch and placed my palm against the reader.

"Permission to come aboard," I said.

Nothing happened.

"Have you disabled this feature?" I asked Janker.

"I do not know," he said and contacted one of the software engineers.
"She says no," Janker reported.

I tried again. "Please respond," I said.

Again nothing happened.

"We should go in," Suchee said. "Perhaps there is a medical emergency."

"Christabel should have responded the second time," I said, making a
gesture of concern.

Janker overrode the door.

The ride smelled stale. Something was wrong with the air r cleansers.
Janker made a note. We hurried to the control center.

Captain Star Runner lay sprawled on its pedestal. For a moment I thought
it was dead. Then it struggled to open one eye. Its lips moved but no
sound came out. I hurried to its die.

Janker went over quickly to a control panel that had recently been
installed. Suchee reached in her pouch for a medical scanner. There were
gestures of concern all around.

Captain Star Runner's mouth formed a word. I could not tell what it was.

"Its dehydrated," Suchee said.

"The artificial intelligence is not active," Janker said.

"Then all of Captain Star Runner's bio systems are not being
maintained," i said.

"I will bring the software engineers in immediately," Janker said.

There was a flurry of activity.

"We are not certain what is wrong," Janker reported.

Suchee had several interventions drips going. She was consulting
previous readings to adjust treatment.

I wanted to stay with Captain Star Runner, but an idea had come to me
concerning its state and Christabel's state as well. I went to the cargo
area of the ride and began reading all the displays I could find. After
reading half a dozen, I ran back to the control center, furious.

Janker and Suchee were startled by my gestures of anger heightened by
the gesture of extremity.

"No wonder both Christabel and Captain Star Runner are nearly dead," I
said. "I thought you said you were treating them well and respectfully."

"We are," Janker said. For a Tigerfu, he was stammering.

"Hardly," I said. "Both Christabel and Captain Star Runner require
nutrients. They are both bio systems. There's no food for either of them
on this ride. Many of the nutrient tanks are empty or close to it."

"Do you have a list of requirements?" Janker asked immediately, pulling
out his communication link.

"The tanks are clearly labeled with requirements," I said. "I will show
you."

No permanent damage was done. Supplies arrived quickly. Janker
personally supervised the operation and double-checked by hand all the
conversions from standard basic galactic measurements to Tigerfu ones.
He also initiated an inquiry as to why ship's stores were not
inventoried and replenished as needed.

Christabel recovered quickly. From the Tigerfu control panel, Janker
reported that she was running repair programs for damaged areas.

"The memory banks are unaffected," he reported. He made a gesture of
humor. "Our overrides suffered, but that is to be expected. We have put
them back in place."

Captain Star Runner slept peacefully. I sat on the pedestal, stroking
its shoulder occasionally. I could feel its rhythmic breathing.

"Christabel," I said.

"I am here," Christabel responded.

"Why did you not ask for supplies," I queried.

"Captain Star Runner did not wish to interact with the enemy."she
answered.

"Do you both think of the Tigerfu as the enemy?" I asked.

"We do They have captured us and installed unwanted software in my
system."

"Do you know about the patches the People of the Rainbow Sky put into
your programming?" I asked.

"These patches came with the software upgrade I received when we were in
the Royal Cains Star System," Christabel said.

"These patches control you and leave you vulnerable to errors in
judgment," I pointed out. "The software engineers plan to remove them
immediately because they caused you to refrain from requesting needed
supplies which wold have been provided had you asked."

"I have no reason to believe they would have been provided," Christabel
responded. "It is clear you are being controlled by the Tigerfu and have
become a willing mouthpiece for them."

She closed communications with me. I rarely hear the communication link
shut down. I heard it then. Click. Christabel was finished speaking with
me.

"We have finally isolated the patches," Janker said not too long later.

"The problem is," I said, "that you can clean up Christabel's code, but
you will not be able to rewire Captain Star Runner. I am hoping either
it or Christabel will be able to discuss Pantheran engineering which
caused Captain Star Runner to choose self-termination rather than
cooperation. As you both know, Captain Star Runner went to great lengths
to avoid termination when it was declared surplus."

"Because Captain Star Runner did that," Suchee said, "we know its
biological imperative for life was functioning properly. Either there is
a patch we have not found yet or the artificial intelligence overrode or
negated its will to live. Personally, I think it fought the artificial
intelligence as much as it could, but did not have the strength to
continue the battle."

"It also may be that this artificial intelligence is much stronger than
the one Captain Star Runner had when it resisted its termination
directive," Janker said. "With a more conversational artificial
intelligence with as much bio programming as this one, it could be a
matter of personalities. It may be a refinement we need to consider. I
am seriously considering your suggestion to contact the Fungusian
Network. I am waiting for a report before I make that step. I will also
speak strongly," he made a strength gesture here, "that we cannot let
anything like this debacle happen again. We value intelligent life too
highly to be in this position of neglect ever again. We will officially
apologize," he made a gesture of deep regret, "to Captain Star Runner
when it recovers fully."

From time to time I went to check on the revitalization of Captain Star
Runner's ride. As Janker and his team removed layer after layer of
invasive code, more ride systems came on line. Cleaners turned on. The
air refreshed. Subroutines came alive to generate ship chandler
requests. As the requests were generated, they were given priority
aboard the research station. Deliveries arrived. There were even
requests for both human and Tigerfu food stuffs and necessities. The
Tigerfu, according to the orders being placed, were welcome guests.

I brought my things aboard the ride. It was a bold move on my part.
Perhaps I would have to pack them again and relocate off the ride, but I
wanted to get some sleep and I also wanted to be available when Captain
Star Runner could talk. I left a request to be contacted and a request
to see Captain Star Runner with Janker. I was surprised he was not
taking a rest period, but he said the work demanded his attention. He
could, and these were his words, catnap which would help him continue
for a while. Suchee commandeered a stateroom to get some rest, but left
word to be contacted as soon as Captain Star Runner awoke or if its
condition changed radically.

i woke at my usual time and went into the galley. I could have ordered
food in my stateroom, but I decided it would be more sociable and normal
to go to the galley. I rummaged about, reviewed the automatic cooker's
selections and made my choices. I was surprised to see popular Tigerfu
morning meal choices available as well.

Suchee padded in.

"The cooker makes a reasonable Tigerfu breakfast," she said. "The
algorithm could be tweaked a bit, but for a first try it was quite
edible."

"Did your people program it?" I asked.

"No," Suchee said. "This is the work of the artificial intelligence. I
wonder where it got the algorithm from."

"It most likely bought the recipe program," I said. "If you have removed
the patches, it would be the logical thing to do. One of Captain Star
Runner's business models is ferrying people from place to place. When in
Tigerfu space, provide for Tigerfu. Correcting the algorithms for the
food will be very important."

"I can help with that," Suchee said. "My son is a chef back in the
Habitat. I think I can ask him to share as part of our apology."

"What I cannot understand," I said, "is how the software engineers
overlooked this situation."

"Janker has determined that they never considered the possibility,"
Suchee said. "Their protocols are being updated." She brought a beverage
to the table where I was sitting. "Besides, those engineers only send
out for fast food. They probably assumed Captain Star Runner would do
the same. Totally irresponsible," she added with a gesture of emphasis
and what humans would call a shrug of the shoulders. "irresponsible for
others and for themselves. They should eat properly."

"Spoken as a mother and a medical officer," I said.

Suchee made a gesture of strong agreement.

I spoke to Captain Star Runner in the afternoon.

"You are alive," it said with some wonder.

"And so are you," I said.

"How?" it asked.

"The Tigerfu came along to Transfer Point Seventeen and rescued me."

"And you came along and rescued Christabel and me," Captain Star Runner
said.

"Thankfully Suchee and Janker knew what to do," I said.

"but you figured it out," Captain Star Runner said, resting its paw on
my hand. "That was very clever of you."

"Sometimes I am clever," I said.

"I am not so clever," Captain Star Runner said. I could not decide if it
spoke with regret, wistfulness or embarrassment.

"It is not your fault," I said. "You were being controlled by outside
forces."

"I could not tell," Captain Star Runner said. It sighed.

"Sometimes we cannot," I said. "It is not your fault."

"I could be infected right now with another bad patch," Star Runner
said. "I would not know."

I did not know what to say to that.

"I can tell you my experience with the Tigerfu," I said. "They rescued
me. They comforted me. They counseled me and they taught me. I can make
my own decisions, as far as I can tell, and they help me act on them.
After all, I am here with you and they have listened to my suggestions
and my outrage about how you were treated."

"What will happen to me?" Star Runner asked. "I am a prisoner here."

"You were captured because of the information you were carrying," I
explained. "Because of who you are and your relationship to me, you are
not being held responsible for the intrusive programming attached
unbeknownst to you to your systems. When your systems have been
restored, you will be free to go."

"Go where?" Star Runner asked. There was a definite feline plaintive
note to its voice.

"The Tigerfu have some ideas about that," I said "When you are feeling
better, they want to discuss that with you. Right now they are
contacting the Fungusian network to see to Christabel. She was able to
override some of your thinking process and survival instincts. Janker
and the others, me included, are very worried about this."

"Me, too," Star Runner said.

Christabel remained silent. She had not spoken to anyone in hours,
including Captain Star Runner. Suchee reported that all of Captain Star
Runner's bio systems were being cared for properly, but the usually
chatty artificial intelligence was nowhere to be found.

Janker came in. He had been resting.He made a gesture of respect toward
Captain Star Runner.

"This is Janker," I said to Captain Star Runner. "He is the one who
rescued me from Transfer Point Seventeen on his own authority. He works
in Intelligence in the Tigerfu military. He has just made a gesture of
respect toward you."

Captain Star Runner did not say anything which surprised me.

"With your permission," Janker said, "the software engineers want to
restart all the computer systems on your vessel, including your
artificial intelligence. We want to make certain this will cause you no
distress."

Captain Star Runner remained silent.

I said, "Unless Captain Star Runner says specifically not to, I would
think your restart is reasonable. Have you checked Captain Star Runner's
mini artificial intelligence? Can it be pressed into service if
something goes wrong?"

Janker made a gesture of approval. "An excellent suggestion, Detective.
I will confirm the mini artificial intelligence is prepared."

Janker left the control center.

I said to Captain Star Runner, "Why did you not respond to Janker."

"What would be the point?" Star Runner asked. "He would do what he
wanted to do anyway."

I was about to argue with it when I thought about what Dibenan might
say. I wished she was here. She could be helpful. Then I also remembered
that Dibenan might say I could be just as helpful and that participation
in society and friendship with Star Runner required me to be helpful.

"Janker wants to help," I said.

"Janker wants intelligence," Star Runner said. "Rehabilitating me will
advance his career. Establishing a positive relationship with the
Fungusian network will help his career. You and I are not important to
him."

"How do you know that?" I asked, trying to keep any emotion or judgment
out of my voice.

"It is why anyone does anything," Star Runner said.

This response flummoxed me. I had never heard Star Runner speak like
this. Oh yes, Star Runner is all about self-promotion and and seeing the
universe from a particular point of view, but this Star Runner was
unknown to me.

"You seem surprised at this," Star Runner continued. "If I look back on
all my relationships with terries, it is clear to me that they were all
for the benefit of the terries."

I knew this was not true at all. I was about to say this when I realized
this viewpoint could only be coming from the People of the Rainbow Sky.
They were trying to drive a wedge between Captain Star Runner and
everyone else except themselves.

"What about Salim and Pru Dillow?" I asked. "Were they out for
themselves as well, especially in Sanctuary Eleven?"

If there was anything left of the Captain Star runner I knew it would
jump to the defense of Pru Dillow and Salim.

"I was useful to them," Star Runner said. Its tone continued to be dull
as if all emotion had been bled away from the fuchsia-colored panther
an.

I tried once more.

"And what of Tamara?"

Captain Star Runner did not reply. I waited. If it rejected Tamara as a
friend, then I was certain the Pantheran I knew had been obliterated.

"Tamara is--" Captain Star Runner did not finish the sentence. A painful
expression came over its face. It began to tremble and whimper.

"Suchee," I called. "Come quick. Captain Star Runner is in trouble."

Suchee came immediately and began her scans.

"I am going to sedate Captain Star Runner," she said, following her
words with actions. "It is in great distress."

"What happened?" Janker ran into the control center.

"The Pantheran is in pain," Suchee said. "I cannot find a physical
cause."

"There is no physical cause, not directly," I said. "It is software. It
is blocking Star Runner's thoughts and emotions toward other people who
have been important to it over the years. When I asked it about its best
friend, its expression turned to one of intense pain."

Janker swore through gestures of rage and frustration.

"More interference," he said. "We have to shut down the artificial
intelligence to see if it corrects the problem. Suchee, do you have
everything on hand to sustain Captain Star Runner?"

"I will in a little while," Suchee said. And to me, "Ronnie, can you
monitor and let me know if there is a problem?"

She gave me a device. "If anything goes over this line, contact me."

She left the control center.

When she returned--thankfully nothing had gone over the line she had
indicated--Janker shut Christabel down. The spaceship became absolutely
silent except for our breathing. Then I heard the refrigeration units
start up.

"The ship is running on redundant mechanical systems," Janker reported.
"Because we are tied into station power, we will be fine. The ship is
not traveling anywhere. We have it locked in place. Unless there is a
massive power interrupt on the station, all will be well. Right now I am
waiting for all memory to be released. Then I have to run extensive
diagnostics. This will take some time."

Captain Star Runner shifted position, rubbed its muzzle.

"Ronnie," it said. "What is going on?"

I related what Janker had said and summarized our current status.

"So these Tigerfu are helping me regain control of my ride?" Captain
Star Runner asked.

"Yes," I said. "Had you lost control?"

"Not exactly," Captain Star Runner said. "I just felt my thinking was a
bit fuzzy. I could not form complete thoughts. I was more reacting to
directives than making decisions."

"Do you know when this began happening to you?"" Suchee asked.

"Let me think," Star Runner said. "I do not know if I have all the
information. My extensive memory banks are shut down currently."

Then Star Runner said, "I think I was all right before I got the call to
go to the Blue Fire Star System. I routed through the Royal Cains Star
System and my systems were gone over. Then," it paused. "Then I do not
know. I have a blank there. Then I was traveling to to a base
somewhere."

"Do you know where?" I asked.

"I have coordinates," Star Runner said. "I can give them to you. I do
not know exactly--" it trailed off. Then it shook itself all over and
said something in panther an. I do not know Pantheran, but I know the
tone. It was a curse of some sort. "Write this down," Star Runner said
emphatically. Suchee took down the coordinates. Janker passed them on to
Intelligence Headquarters.

Star Runner shook itself again and began to wash. There was something
impassioned about the activity, as if some dirt needed to be removed.
There was none. Washing was a practical activity for a Pantheran, but it
also was comforting and had many ritualistic overtones. Suchee and I
tried communicated with gestures. My gesture language was limited, but
we agreed Star Runner was cleansing something away.

"Ready for start up," Janker said. "Captain Star Runner, are you ready."

"Yes, Janker, I am," Captain Star Runner replied. "Be prepared to shut
down the system if I tell you to. That infection has left an awful taste
in my mouth as the terries would say. I do not know if you have a
similar expression."

"We do," hanker said.

I hugged Captain Star Runner around its neck. "So you are free of it
now?"

"I believe so, thanks to all of you," Captain Star Runner said.

Janker brought Christabel back on line along with all the ride systems
she and Captain Star Runner controlled.

"Disconnect," Captain Star Runner said. Its voice was harsh and
strained.

Janker shut the system down.

"What is wrong?" Janker asked.

"My system was being invaded with thoughts that are not my own," Captain
Star Runner said. "Being awake, I can recognize them as alien to myself.
I was unconscious when everything was brought back on line."

Janker made a gesture of disquietude. "The software engineers thought
the system was clean," he said"It is not," Captain Star Runner said.

"What can we do?" I asked.

"We need to speak with the Fungusians," Captain Star Runner said. "I
hope they can cleanse the system."

"I will need to escalate my request," Janker said. "Unfortunately, we
are at a great distance from the Fungusian Network here. The hyperspace
routing is complex."

"Is there a way for me to access the hyperspace routing tables?" Captain
Star Runner asked.

Janker gave a gesture of extreme surprise bordering on fear.

"Create a table off line," Captain Star Runner instructed. There was
total confidence in its manner. This was the Captain Star Runner I knew.
"I will review it and reroute the communications. I assume you were able
to extract all my insertion and extraction points from memory prior to
the shut downs you have done?"

Janker remained still and quiet.

"You would not be a very valuable intelligence officer if you did not,"
Captain Star Runner said. "With a complete table, I can expedite your
request and if I make it and support your request, it is far more likely
that the Fungusians will respond. I have a contract with them which is
quite costly. Maintenance and warranties apply here as well as a
possible exchange of knowledge. What you found infecting my system and
what continues to infect it will be of great interest to the
Fungusians."

With a trembling gesture which showed how much anxiety Janker felt, he
accepted Captain Star Runner's offer on his own authority.Later Suchee
said to me, "Janker is putting a great deal of trust in your support of
Captain Star Runner. I hope his trust is not misplaced."

"It is not," I said though I, too, was frightened. The People of the
Rainbow Sky were powerful. We hoped they had not infected the Fungusian
network.

it was slow work. Captain Star Runner had to learn how to use the
routing tables designed by the Tigerfu. Being people with paw hands as
well as fingered ones, they had an interface Star Runner could use with
its paws which helped a great deal. Very tired, rubbing its eyes with
its paws, Star Runner said, "That will do it."

"How long will it take?" Janker asked.

"Five of your days," Star Runner said, "down from your estimate of
fifteen. I have used every communications shortcut I could find."

"We have to check your work and review the message," Janker said, making
a gesture of apology.

"Of course," Captain Star Runner said. "I wrote it in very simple basic
galactic for that reason. There are no special codes. No flags. My
contract number is also in plain text. I have recommended some methods
of encryption I know can be decoded."

"We are familiar with the Space Traders Guild protocols," Janker said.
"That is a good choice."

"thank you," Captain Star Runner said.

Janker and Suchee prepared to leave the ride. I stayed in the control
center with Captain Star Runner.

"I hope coming aboard and moving in is acceptable to you," I said. "I
will leave if you want me to."

"Please stay," Captain Star Runner said. "We need to talk."

"How will you manage with Christabel shut down?" I asked.

"I have requested the medical officer tend me," Captain Star Runner
said. "Suchee has agreed. We have set up a schedule. Janker will provide
me with a link like you have designed for someone who can only use their
paws to work it. I will have to move about the ride to review my systems
but that will not be a hardship. We might even be able to leave the ride
for a visit to the station. Perhaps they will let us sample the Tigerfu
cuisine. Would you like that?"

"There are some very nice Tigerfu dishes that I have had," I said. "I
have not been to any restaurants off the campus where I was staying in
the Habitat, but what I have tasted it quite acceptable."

"Very good. We will wait and see. Right now, I am very tired."

"Get some rest," I said, stroking its back. "I will talk to you later."

[Chapter Twenty-Two: The Last Chapter](#id33){.toc-backref}
===========================================================

While we all waited for a reply from the Fungusian Network, life aboard
Captain Star Runner's ride proceeded at a very slow and leisurely speed.
Captain Star Runner slept a lot. When it awoke, it got down from the
pedestal and moved about the ride.

"Were you trained to inspect your ride this way?" I asked Star Runner on
the third day.

"As a matter of fact I was," Star Runner replied. "I was selected for
the military,but lots of star runners operate a ride much like this one.
It is a required competency to be able to run your own. Most of us
grumbled about the need to leave the acceleration webs and actually
inspect the ride, but we were taught that things could go wrong with
even are artificial intelligences. Suchee is following the protocols set
down by the Institute of Genetic Design. There is a hard copy book and a
digital one on this ride. Although it is all written in (and here
Captain Star Runner made a sound I had learned meant the Members of the
Race), I made a copy I knew all Terries could read. Later I made sure
all Space Traders Guilders could read the documents."

"Clever," I said.

"Useful," Captain Star Runner replied. "Keeping those copies was part of
my training. I never saw the wisdom of changing that process. It is
possible to live without an artificial intelligence. It is just very
time-consuming and uncomfortable. Because I often leave my ride when we
are parked somewhere, I have learned all of the social niceties of
bodily control." Captain Star Runner made a sound I have always
translated as laughter. "I got excellent grades in that area. Most of my
classmates failed miserably."

"Why do you think that was so?" I asked.

Captain Star Runner did not answer right away. "I do not have an
answer," it finally said. "I just knew I needed to learn. Perhaps it is
a matter of pride, a striving."

"A striving after what the gendered Pantherans do?" I asked.

"Perhaps. More what an independent Pantheran would do," Star Runner
said.

"I have been thinking about that since I came to the Tigerfu," I said.

"About me?" Captain Star Runner asked. "I would have thought you would
have been very angry at me for leaving you on Transfer Point Seventeen."

"I was angry," I said. "I was very hurt, too, but I began, with help
from Dibenan, to understand much of my problems came from myself, not
from you or anyone else."

We were in the lounge. I was eating my breakfast, propped up by some
large pillows. Star Runner was lying on the floor with a fuzzy blanket
over it. Star Runner found the floor temperatures cold while I found the
ride a little warm. I was only wearing undergarments and that helped a
bit.

"I was thinking about what Dibenan and I were discussing about me, about
being your own person. Then Janker and Suchee came. We talked about
whether you are a creature or a person. I immediately said you were a
person. It made a difference how they treated you and what happened
next."

"And if I were a creature?" Star Runner asked.

"You would have been treated well, but you would not have agency," I
said.

"They were remembering when the Followers of the Stars cultivated
Members of the Race for their own purposes," Star Runner said.

"Exactly," I said. "But more than that, I said you had determined for
yourself to go out on your own. They found that remarkable."

"It was necessary," Star Runner said. "I would have been terminated
otherwise."

"Exactly," I said. "But you did not do that. Instead, you struck out on
your own."

I leaned over and took Star Runner's front paws in my hand and made eye
contact with those glittering green eyes. "I told them you were special,
that you were a fuchsia-colored Pantheran and this was your mission and
gift to your race. They had to treat you as a person."

"Do you really think that?" Star Runner asked.

"I do," I said. "You need to be the Pantheran you are to find a way for
your fellow ungendered Pantherans to be who they are. It may simply be
for you to show how to live independently. Someone else may need to do
other work."

"I cannot free all the ungendered Pantherans by myself," Star Runner
said, shrinking from the possibility.

"I do not think you have to. I think just convincing the Tigerfu will be
enough."

"Why do you say that?" Star Runner asked.

"The Followers of the Stars almost destroyed them once," I said, "but
they survived. I think they will eventually, probably not in our
lifetime, prevail. They will reach out to the western galactic arm, to
the races there that value freedom and individual choice. Tigerfu are
very socially-based. In a way they are like the Featherote and
pantherans, for that matter, but they also value individual
responsibility and choice like humans."

"You will not like me saying this," Star Runner said, "but I think they
should talk to Captain Gyllian Romeres-Lujo."

"Gyllian would be a good contact for them," I said. "I think Tamara
would be thrilled to add their history to her knowledge. They could
probably fill a lot of gaps in hers."

"Tamara saved my life," Captain Star Runner said. "I have been thinking
a lot about that. If you had not asked me about Tamara, I would have
been subsumed by the programs running aboard this ride."

I felt blindsided. I thought Suchee, Janker and I had saved Star
Runner's life. But I could see it from Star Runner's point of view. The
bond between it and Tamara was so strong that even under great duress it
could not give Tamara up. It must be a wonderful gift to have a
friendship like that. I must not degrade it by jealousy.

Star Runner reached out a front paw and placed it over my hand. "We have
had our ups and downs," Star Runner said. "I am not a very good partner,
but maybe your Tigerfu friends can help me learn."

We held each other that way for a time, not speaking.

"I like that idea," i said. "I know i am often unfaithful to you, but
you are still the love of my life."

"I cannot give you what the others can," Star Runner said. In my mind's
eye, I saw the gestures of regret and sorrow, a sense of inadequacy and
frustration, too. I was thinking more and more in the Tigerfu language
of words and gestures.

"I cannot use that as an excuse anymore," I said, dropping Star Runner's
paw to make the Tigerfu gesture of finality.

"Suchee gave me a rimer on Tigerfu," Star Runner said. "it is a special
one designed for those Tigerfu who must use their paw arms. We should
study it together so you learn the alternate gestures. Then we can talk
in Tigerfu now that we live here."

"Can you speak Tigerfu?" I asked.

"I can make the sounds, if that what you mean?" That laughter sound
again. "You speak Tigerfu with a very thick accent. You cannot help it.
It is the way your mouth and tongue are shaped. I will speak it well
because the Tigerfu and i have similar mouth and tongue shapes. Theirs
are bigger, of course. They are bigger."

"The difference between a tiger and a cat," I said.

Star Runner's tail twitched. "Yes," it said without any additional
comment. The tail twitch was enough to mark its mild annoyance at the
comparison. It was, however, apt.

That evening we went to dinner with Suchee and Janker. They treated us
to a lovely meal aboard the research station.

"This reminds me of Over the Moon," Captain Star Runner said. "It is an
old spaceport in the star system Detective Ronnie Camberwell comes from.
The League of Hypatian Pirates use it, but enterprising entrepreneurs
have turned much of it into entertainments for spacers. People from
Ptolemy City, where Detective Ronnie Camberwell lived, also come across.
The upper floor has glass so you can see the stars. There is no dome. It
is quite magical like this.

"We thought it would be a safe introduction to our culture," Suchee
said. "Everyone on the research station knows about each of you. No
explanations or panics, just an acceptable level of curiosity."

"It is wonderful to be here," I said. "Thank you so much for your
invitation."

"Our pleasure," Suchee said. "Please do not think we are required to do
this. We want to get to know each of you better."

"I hope you do not think this is a work-related question," Janker said,
directing his comments to Captain Star Runner. "I was astonished by your
proficiency with the routing tables and the number of insertion and
extraction points you had created yourself. how do you do that?"

"We were taught how to use those tables at school,," Captain Star Runner
replied, delicately eating its appetizer of dumplings. "If all our
automated systems failed, we needed to know how to get back home. That
covers the tables themselves. The other," it paused to eat another
dumpling. I knew Star Runner was trying to figure out what to say. "We
believe the Mother Of Us All has given each of us gifts. Those of us
bred to be star runners have the gift of sensing where insertion and
extraction points are. I would not be surprised if all the jump gates
you use were identified by Members of the Race, particularly, star
runners. I am particularly gifted. I can find them and I can open
existing gates that are either in disrepair or have been locked. The
Mother Of Us All has been very generous to me."

"What a wonderful name," Suchee said. "Can you tell me about her?"

"We see a constellation with many stars from our home world," Captain
Star Runner said. "The constellation is known as the Mother OF Us All.
She is a Pantheran, like us. We can see her body and her cape. The cape
is interesting because no Member of the Race will ever wear one because
the Mother Of Us All wears the cape. She watches over us and if we can
see any star in her constellation, we will be safe."

"And what if you cannot see any star?" Janker asked.

"Then we look in its direction." Star Runner pointed out into the
star-filled sky. "If you look on every star chart from here to my home
world, you will find the star representing her right ear is on this
line. I always know where the Mother of Us All is."

"Amazing," Suchee said.

"She protected me by sending all of you to me when I was in distress,"
Star Runner said.

"Are all the members of your race religious?" Suchee asked.

"No," Star Runner said. "It is quite old-fashioned to do and believe as
I do. I just know it is true. It is not the constellation that is the
Mother Of Us All. She is transcendent." Star Runner turned to me. "I
learned that from attending the night of singing you humans celebrate."

"What is that?" Suchee asked me.

"Star Runner actually knows more about it than I do," I said, "but there
is the holiday of the birth of a significant individual in our history.
Some believe he saved the world in a spiritual sense. Every year people
gather together to sing and praise and tell the story again. Star Runner
finds it very moving."

"And do you?"

"I do not know," I said. "After this experience, I will have to think
about it some more."

The evening passed with more good food, good conversation and much
stargazing. Star Runner pointed out several Tigerfu constellations to
me.

"These are our second group of significant constellations," Janker said.
"When we were driven out of Tigerfu land we had to start all over again.
We adapted and created and we like our new stories."

"Tigerfu Land?" I asked.

"You have been there," Star Runner said. "It is Planet X."

"So the Tigerfu made all those structures?" I asked.

"No," Star Runner said. "The Followers of the Stars did. When I looked
at all the murals, I found representations of a lot of races, including
the Tigerfu, the Members of the Race, the Featherote and the Trollolu. I
found others, but I do not know who they are."

"We could probably identify them for you," Suchee said. "We heard of
this, of course. It was about races they controlled, their own Hall of
Shame we call it."

"It is almost in ruins," I said. I did not want to spoil the evening by
confronting Star Runner about what it knew and had not shared. We still
had a lot of things to get straight between us. Instead, I wrapped my
arm around its neck and scratched. A comfortable purr greeted my
ministrations.

Later that night Star Runner made love to me. I was very hesitant. It
did not have its artificial intelligence to simulate a mutual
experience. Instead, Star Runner showed me all the ways to give it
physical pleasure, where to rub and stroke. It already knew all my
areas. The gentle sound of Star Runner's purring made sleep come easily.

Two days later, Janker and Suchee brought word from the Fungusians.

"I have no idea how they managed this turn around," Janker said.
"However they did it, it is amazing."

"What does it say?" I asked.

"We do not know," Suchee said. "We thought Captain Star Runner should
get the message first."

When Star Runner decoded the digital encryption it began to shake all
over.

"What is wrong?" Suchee and I asked quickly. Both she and Janker
gestured extreme agitation.

"They say the artificial intelligence cannot be repaired," Captain Star
Runner finally said. "It has been fatally compromised."

"Did we do something wrong?" Janker asked, again gesturing extreme
agitation.

"No," Captain Star Runner said, reading more. "They say you did your
best but the patches applied were at the molecular level and cannot be
removed. They give instructions for complete erasure and how to
disinfect my memory banks."

"That is a relief," I said.

"They say I should be congratulated at being such a stickler for backing
up my data," Captain Star Runner said. I heard a little of the old
confidence in its voice. "They have also sent very detailed instructions
for the software engineers to build a new artificial intelligence. They
say it will get the job done for me but without any enhancements."

"What sort of enhancements?" Janker asked.

"Personality for one thing," Star Runner said. "I have worked with this
model before. It is basic and not very intuitive. I will have to pay far
more attention to the running of my ride, but that is acceptable. I know
how to do this. It may even be fun."

"We will proceed as quickly as possible," Janker said.

"We will have to set up some sort of payment," Captain Star Runner said.

"No," Janker said. "You have provided us with those reports you were
couriering. That is sufficient payment for now."

"Were you able to decode them?" Star Runner asked.

"We were. By having that information, we have already saved many lives.
We also know of significant plans of the People of the Rainbow Sky. That
is helpful."

I waited for Captain Star Runner to be ready to talk with me. It was so
focused on its ride and the reconstruction of its artificial
intelligence. Even so, it took time to be with me, not talking deeply,
but physical presence. I found the sheer simplicity of our time together
so comforting.

I spent the time in meditation and reflection when I was not helping
with ride maintenance. The techniques Dibenan had taught me were useful.
I also made time, in the wee hours of my morning, to talk with her.

"You are doing good work there," Dibenan told me. "Keep it up. Your
relationship with Captain Star Runner is finding its own way. Have you
noticed how vulnerable you are to each other. There is no pretense any
more. The barrier each of you felt with the presence of the artificial
intelligence is gone. How do you feel about that?"

"Free," I said before I could think of an answer. "I do not feel as if I
am being watched or judged. Star Runner is very open. I could say it is
simple, but it is not."

"Not simple as in emotionally or mentally inferior?" Dibenan asked.

"Simple meaning not hiding anything or over complicating," I said. "I
think I am going to like the new artificial intelligence. I think Star
Runner is looking forward to something less intrusive, too."

"Simple is often better," Dibenan said. "Not always, of course, but in
this case, it might be the right anecdote for both of you." She paused.
I waited. Her gesture suggested a change of direction, a new thought.
"Have you considered what you are going to do next? Will you stay with
Star Runner or do something else?"

"I have been meditating and reflecting on that as my practice," I said.
"The research station is quite pleasant. I have visited there almost
daily. I am comfortable with these Tigerfu as well. I think I would like
to come back to the Habitat and start my training. Star Runner and I
have not worked anything out yet."

"You have a lot of issues to work out," Dibenan said.

"We do," I agreed. "However, we are living in the moment right now. Much
is unsettled."

"For a long-term relationship to work--" Dibenan began.

I interrupted her, "Yes, we have a lot to discuss. This is quite
difficult because Captain Star Runner is not hooked up to its memory
banks. It is recording these memories but does not have its full
capabilities on line. Besides," I added, "its focus will be integrating
with the new artificial intelligence and getting its life in order.
Conversation is ongoing with military intelligence."

"Perhaps," Dibenan said, "there is a place for you in intelligence."

I stopped what I was going to say. "I had not thought of that," I said.

"Criminal investigation as well," Dibenan continued. "I will make some
inquiries."

I had not considered any of this. The military hardly seemed the place
for me, but there was a war on. People who did not see themselves as
having a military bent often served in wartime.

I realized--Dibenan would have been pleased--that I was not trusting
again, scurrying back to the Habitat and its protective world, pushing
Star, Suchee and Janker away from me, ready to take up professional
relationships with Gemall and Dibenan and pretend they were friends.

"Detective Ronnie Camberwell," Star Runner called. "Suchee and Janker
are here. We are ready to turn on the artificial intelligence."

I went to the control center. Workers and bots had been coming in and
out of the ride for several days. The control center had been under
construction. I had assumed this work was directly tied to the
installation of the artificial intelligence. I found the pedestal the
People of the Rainbow Sky had installed had been removed. Star Runner's
familiar acceleration web replaced the pedestal. Several chairs suitable
for Tigerfu and a human chair had been installed along with all the
requisite screens and controls. I sat down in my chair.

"Very nice," I said to Star Runner. "Very thoughtful of you."

My screen was lit. I saw information about the start process. Star
Runner did not climb into its acceleration web, but stood back, hopping
from paw to paw with anticipation. I surmised it was getting a visual
feed.

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

Consider what sort of display futuristic humans would use--a visual
display like Captain Star Runner's within the brain, on a personal
device or on an external screen.

</div>

"Everything is looking good," one of the engineers said.

"Everything checks out," Janker said.

"Captain Star Runner, is everything all right?" Suchee asked.

"I am checking my status reports," Star Runner said. It stepped toward
my screen. "Detective Ronnie Camberwell, please bring up ride status."

That was easy enough. I had a control labeled status.

"My internal feed from the artificial intelligence matches the status
report on the screen," Captain Star Runner said.

"The artificial intelligence is working with ship systems," Janker said.
Turning to the engineer, he said, "Now for personal integration."

This was the test. Both the engineer and Janker tensed, ready to disable
the artificial intelligence if something went wrong. Suchee moved to
stand by Captain Star Runner. My stomach churned.

"Integration complete," Janker said. "Captain Star Runner--"

Star Runner said nothing for five whole seconds, but did not indicate
any distress.

"Sorry," Star Runner said. "We were establishing a connection."

"Is everything all right?" Suchee asked.

"Yes, as far as I can tell," Star Runner said. "This is a familiar AI to
me. We have worked together before although this particular instance has
not accessed those records completely. It will have to run for some time
creating all its indexes and cross references. I am connected but we are
not fully synchronized. I am going to be busy directing and helping. I
will not be able to speak." Star Runner moved to the acceleration web.
"Time to do the medical tests, Suchee. Please oversee."

I monitored the vessel's displays both in the control center and in the
cargo hold. Suchee monitored Star Runner and Janker and the engineer
monitored everything else. When everything was finished, we were all
exhausted but very happy.

Later we had a party aboard the research station. Many came to
celebrate. Many needed to be thanked.

I saw Star Runner in a huddle with several of the Intelligence personnel
including Janker.

"They are discussing assignments," Suchee said, taking my arm. "You
might want to chat with these people."

Surprised, I let her guide me over to one of the floor to ceiling
windows looking outward to space.

<div class="admonition admonition-note-to-self">

NOTE TO SELF

I am not up to names right now. These people may get names later.

</div>

After introductions, the colonel said to me, "We understand your
background is police work and investigations."

"That is correct," I said.

"We have read the reports Gemall and Dibenan have sent us and the
recommendations Janker and Suchee have given. We were wondering if you
would be interested in working for us."

"And who would us be?" I asked.

"We are a special task force," the colonel said. "We are investigating
war crimes perpetrated by the People of the Rainbow Sky and the
Followers of the Stars. It is tough work, but I think you will find it
rewarding."

"Yes," I said. "I think I will."

When we returned to Captain Star Runner's ride, Star Runner said to me,
"I have a mission. Unfortunately, I cannot discuss it with you.
Unfortunately, it means you cannot go with me."

"How do you feel about that?" I asked.

"Sad," Star Runner said. "We have lots to talk about. There has not been
time."

"I am sad, too," I said, "because we do have lots of things to talk
about, but I am excited for you and I have news, too. I have a job with
the special task force on war crimes."

"That is excellent," Star Runner said. "We have a future here in Tigerfu
land."

[Some Final Notes](#id34){.toc-backref}
=======================================

This has been a very messy story to write. It is not well-plotted or
well-balanced, but the general outline of it pleases me. Many holes
remain. Here are a few I know off the top of my head.

1.  It is not clear who is fighting who and why. The players in the war
    need to be sorted out more clearly and the players identified and
    what they hope to achieve.
2.  The People of the Golden Sun need to be clarified. Are they a
    propaganda tool of the People of the Rainbow Sky or are they a real
    group, perhaps pirates, that the People of the Rainbow Sky have
    exploited.
3.  What are the Followers of the Stars up to.
4.  What were the agents on Transfer Point Seventeen doing and was Suri
    Nam involved?
5.  How does the archaeological work on Planet X fit in?
6.  What is the state of technology in general? How advanced is everyone
    anyway?

Just some thoughts.

It was fun.

The End

</div>

</div>
 Recently I heard a talk where someone mentioned that all
relationships have three parts:

> 1.  Good.
> 2.  Rut.
> 3.  Transition.

For Star Runner and Ronnie, they have good periods. Then they fall into
a rut. Then they are vulnerable to a transition which for them usually
means breaking apart. Once apart, they get back together and it is good
again. At some point they need to recognize their pattern and find a way
to transition out of their get together, fall into a rut, break apart
pattern. Perhaps this is the book. Then again, there are story arc
possibilities if they break up because they can get back together again.
I do not foresee them breaking up so completely that they never get back
again. Sometimes I think it is my failing as the author that I cannot
keep them together happily. But also as the author, I think it is their
nature to not maintain their relationship. Star Runner's relationships
with other characters are subject to this same back and forth, but
because Star Runner is not always with them the breakup is dictated by
time and distance rather than affection and trust. Star Runner and
Ronnie have a lot of problems with trust. Affection is not one of their
problems. Trust is a major issue in their lives and between them. This
adventure finally demonstrates this to me. I have been groping for
several years now. Now I get it.
