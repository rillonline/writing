</ul>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>I want to tell you, dear reader, what is happening to me now. In
future, I may return to these earlier adventures and narrate them for
you.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
As you, dear reader, may recall from Landscape of Thorns, I found it
expedient to remove myself from the western spiral arm of the galaxy.
Members of The Race had agreed to officially terminate me while
allowing me to live outside Coalition space. The Fungusian Cooperative
advised me the Northern Frontier might be still too close to Coalition
Space for safety so I relocated my business to the Pharaoh Star
System, working largely under contract to the League of Hypatian
Pirates. That was a satisfactory arrangement until Captain Gyllian
Romeres Lujo from the Ministry of Defense in the Alliance of planets
requested my assistance to locate our mutual acquaintance Emily
Dickenson who disappeared at the Landscape of Thorns. My adventure
locating Emily Dickenson and the origins of the Landscape of Thorns
put me back on the pantheran Empire’s radar again. Prince Hat, the
only member of an advanced race we met, contracted with me to ride to
a civilization in another arm of our galaxy to obtain some needed
goods. I bid farewell to my dear friends Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo
and Tamara, wished Emily Dickenson well and asked Detective Ronnie
Camberwell if I might contact her on my return. We had been partners
but the stress of space travel during this last adventure had pulled
us apart. We had agreed to separate, leaving each of us free to
partner with someone else. Our conversation over space link reminded
each of us of the attraction we still had to each other. Had it not
been for my fear of the pantheran Empire, I may have returned to the
Pharaoh Star System to see if the partnership could be salvaged. I
think Detective Ronnie Camberwell thought the same thing. However, I
knew this was not wise and I did have a contract with Prince hat.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The ride through Mother space was long. As a star runner, I am
designed to be content in my acceleration web for long periods of
time. My AI, Kristabel, monitored my biological system carefully. I
exercised, slept, ate and played as she directed. Nevertheless, the
ride was long. I arrived at my destination with a fully de-fragmented
and perfectly arranged mind and archived memory system. As a star
runner, my brain and my ride’s digital file system are fully
integrated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
But when I arrived, the civilization prince Hat described no longer
existed and had not existed for some time. The planets had reverted to
jungle, woodlands, prairies and deserts. No sign of advanced life
existed. No trace of space travel existed either. Kristabel and I
searched the star system for some time, hoping to learn what had
become of the civilization Prince Hat and his people had traded with
many millennia ago. I could find nothing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I expanded my search to the surrounding star systems.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was in this way I came across the People of Heaven.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>&gt; &lt;h1 lang=”en-GB” class=”western”&gt;Chapter One&lt;   h1&gt;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In Which I Find sanctuary</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“star System REPORT,” Kristabel SAID.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The details scrolled across the lower part of my right eye. It was a
G-type star, very much like Sol, the home world of the Terries. The
planet distribution was similar, too. We skimmed the frozen worlds at
the outer reach of the star system,gave a cursory inspection to the
gas giants and paid attention to the several planets in the temperate
region. We were looking for Class M worlds since both Prince hat and
his disappeared civilization needed an atmosphere similar to That OF
MY HOME WORLD AND THAT OF THE Terries. We found one. After all this
time, I was about to heave a sigh of relief that we had found the
missing civilization when Kristabel reminded me that this might not be
the planet for the civilization we sought. She also directed my
attention to the three war-rides heading in our direction.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My ride has armaments. No courier would go out of its home system
without them. But I was no match for even one war-ride. I acquiesced
and allowed myself to be herded into space dock and was promptly
arrested.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“On what charge?” I hissed.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Trespassing,” my arresting officer said. “This star system is off-
limits to any outsider.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was unaware–” I began.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ignorance is no defence,” the officer responded. “Your ship will be
confiscated and you will be allowed to flee to the sanctuary city of
your choice.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I learned fleeing to a city of sanctuary was an ancient custom. It had
been institutionalized. Instead of a trial, sentencing and
imprisonment, the accused simply picked a city of sanctuary and, at
state expense, were transported there.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I objected that I needed my ride to maintain my biological well-being.
That request was denied on the grounds I could not take anything with
me to the sanctuary city except what I could carry by myself.
Kristabel was able to program my portable biopack to advise me of my
dietary and physical requirements and to download as much memory
information as fit. She also devised a way, using local removable
storage, to allow me to continue to store memories. She also wrote a
program to assist me in utilizing my own brain storage. She said it
was a feature of my native biological system I had allowed to atrophy
on our ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
You, dear reader, will wonder about the number of adventures where my
memory storage has been compromised. You may be speculating that The
Race’s reliance on the partnership between AI and androgen is bound to
go awry. May I point out that my design is to be part of a ride’s
complement and to stay on the ride most of the time. I was never
designed to be an independent operator. The unfortunate occurrences of
being without an AI occur when I step outside my design parameters.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
So here I am in Sanctuary XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
About the Sanctuary System</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Originally, it was simple. If you killed someone accidentally, that
is, without malice, you could run away to a sanctuary city so the
family of the person you killed would not kill you. If you fled and
you were guilty of murder, that is, intentionally killing someone, the
town or village elders arranged for you to be brought back and put to
death. That was a messy business and often others got killed along the
way. Then people started wondering aloud about the efficacy of capital
punishment. Other people accused of crimes fled to the sanctuary
cities. After a while, it did not seem bad at all for people who
committed crimes or those who were suspected of committing crimes or
even those who had not committed crimes but who were thought to have
done so by others, to leave their towns and villages to go to the
sanctuary cities.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This produced a population in the sanctuary cities which had a higher
percentage of criminals. The people living in the cities wondered what
to do about the criminal populations. . They did not want to pay for
prisons, prison guards,, prison wardens and all the rest. There was no
judicial system in place. So they built a newer city around the walls
of the original city and declared it off-limits to the people seeking
sanctuary.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
You may be wondering, dear reader, what kept anyone inside the
sanctuary cities. Who would know if you were a criminal? Go to the
sanctuary city; stay a while; leave and start a . new life elsewhere.
Except everyone who was given safe passage to a sanctuary city, was
identified and injected with a marker identifying them as a resident
of the sanctuary city. The marker could be filtered out of the
criminal’s blood system, but this was costly and not readily available
on the black market. Furthermore, the society had agreed to put to
death immediately anyone found outside the sanctuary city with a
marker. No defence. No questioning. No exceptions.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This reversal from the no capital punishment stance of earlier history
came about when a score of children were sexually assaulted and then
brutally murdered and dismembered after a mentally ill person escaped
from the sanctuary city. She had been placed there by her family as an
act of mercy. The entire planet was so outraged they re-established
this form of the death penalty.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
All this I learned while I was processed to be settled in Sanctuary
XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Readers of my former adventures know how uncomfortable I am living
planet side. I have become more used to it over the years. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell and I had a large villa on Hypatia. I spent time on
several planets during the Landscape of Thorns adventure. I stayed in
Ptolemy City during the Library of the Mind adventure. None of this
prepared me for my coming to Sanctuary XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Sanctuary XI is not a modern city. It is built of stone with narrow
streets and no ground transportation except for foot traffic and
beasts of burden. That is correct, dear reader. Goods are carried into
the old city on the backs of animals.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There is no infrastructure to the old city. No garbage collection. No
medical services. No connection to cyberspace. All of these amenities
exist elsewhere, but not in the sanctuary city itself.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
But here is a curious thing. The temple and its square are smack dab
in the middle of our part of the city.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was prepared for the worst. As I said, living planet side is not
comfortable for me. Having been born on and lived for many years on a
space station, the narrow streets, small rooms and low ceilings did
not feel claustrophobic to me. Sanctuary City XI is dark and dank.
This is often true of space stations. Heat requires energy. Energy is
expensive. My coat is designed to withstand the cool temperatures and
damp conditions often found in space. I was also fortunate that I
possess instincts which I developed as part of my design parameters. I
hunt. In Sanctuary City XI, I hunt mice, rats and pigeons. The mice
and rats are by-products of urban living. The pigeons roost among the
temple precincts. Although not the best balanced diet, I can consist
on rodents with an occasional bird for variation. I can also barter
with any store owner, stall owner or street vendor to rid them of
these infestations. Individuals or landlords pay me in bullion to go
into their rooms and buildings. In exchange for my services, I live
rent-free in a fairly clean and safe building.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>Sanctuary City XI is not clean. Sanctuary City XI is not safe.
Sanctuary City XI is dreary. Each day is much like the last. People
here are forgotten: by their families, their friends and their
neighbours. No one here has any hope. There is no getting out of
Sanctuary City XI. The Terries have a poet who said the gates of hell
have a sign on them which reads: All ye who enter here, abandon hope.
The gates to Sanctuary City XI do not have this warning, but they
might-just as well have it because this is how everyone who enters
Sanctuary City XI feels . Suicide is common. Another Terry writer
says, “Without a vision, t2ahe people perish.” Everyone around me in
Sanctuary City XI was perishing, sometimes a little every day,
sometimes all at once.</p>

</ol>
<p>Murmuring</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I had just stepped out of the front door of Madame Bovary’s brothel
when I heard the explosion. It was mid-morning. Sunlight was not yet
illuminating the stinking garbage strewn along the street. In the heat
of the day the street would smell worse. Human excrement and vomit
mixed contentiously with kitchen scraps, used condoms and package
wrappers. The stones of the buildings were covered in grime which made
everything a sinister Gray.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was the only scentiant being moving in the street. The rats are
always moving. It was rats that brought me to Madame Bovary’s
establishment on a weekly basis. The brothel owner offered to
remunerate me in trade, but I preferred bullion. There were some items
I require on a regular basis that can only be purchased with real
money.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I intended to go back to my room, but the explosion occurred in the
same direction I would need to travel to reach my room. I turned to
pick my way through the street in the opposite direction. I was a bit
uncertain of where to go, but away from the Street of the Brothels
seemed wise. Too many people. Too many hung over people. Too many
people reaching for their first drink of the day. Too many people
needing a fix, wanting to get high, coming down from a high. This was
an unpredictable area.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Someone called my name.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I turned.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was my friend Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim nevIr came to the Street of the Brothels</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“Salim,” I said. “what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The bomb,” Salim said, “I came to tell you about the bomb.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Sal knew I was mousing at madame Bovary’s brothel this morning.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What bomb?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Didn’t you hear the explosion?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Of course, I heard the bomb,” I said. “I did not know the explosion
was caused by a bomb.”</p>
<p>“At the temple,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Let us go from this street,” I said as windows began to be shuttered
and opened and heads began to peer out into the street. “I do not want
to be in this street if it should become crowded with both curious and
excited people.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That’s a good idea,” Salim said. “Let’s find Pru.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I again turned to pad down the Street of the Brothels away from my
room. Salim followed me without question or without speaking. We
needed to concentrate on where we put our feet. The Street of the
Brothels led into a decrepit part of Sanctuary City XI. Here the
buildings were in poor repair. Stones were missing from the street.
There was even more garbage. I did not know this part of Sanctuary
City XI. Salim, who knew everything there was to know about Sanctuary
City XI did not offer any advice. I located a street of stairs and
made my way up to a higher street. A few more turns and we found
ourselves in a busy thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The Street of the Market,” Salim said, coming to walk on my right
side. “This is further south than we normally visit. I’ve been here on
occasion. There is a tavern at the next intersection which might prove
useful.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I considered Salim’s choice of words. Useful was not a word I
associated with a tavern. Why would going into this establishment be
useful?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I should pause here and describe Salim to you, dear reader. Like me,
Salim is an alien. How he came to Sanctuary City XI I do not know. He
never spoke of it or his people or his home. Salim was just here. A
striking person, Salim would remind my Terry friends of a rabbit with
his long upright ears covered in white fur as was the rest of his
visible body. Salim dressed well, being fastidious about his person
and his clothes. People often had difficulty understanding Salim. His
speech was precise but muffled. I never had a problem hearing his soft
speech.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The name of the tavern was the Crooked Tail Monkey. There was a
picture of this improbable creature freshly painted next to the open
door. Fresh paint was a rarity in Sanctuary City XI. I took note of
this as I entered on Salim’s heels. Noteworthy, too, was the clean
floor and tables, the barmaids in clean aprons and the clean cutlery
and glassware being set down. It was early for a tavern to be open,
but the Crooked Tail Monkey was doing a smart business.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim led me to an already occupied table.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim, my friend,” the woman at the table said. “What do you hear
with those big ears of yours about the bombing at the temple?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim ignored her and instead turned to the two men sitting at the
table. “This is my comrade, Captain Star Runner,” Salim said. “I have
spoken of it to you before.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was taken aback. No one in Sanctuary City XI ever introduced me as
Captain Star Runner. I was simply Star if anyone used my name. Most
people just called me the Cat or the Big Cat. Properly speaking, I am
a fuchsia Pantheran, but as no one in this arm of the Milky Way Galaxy
has ever heard of the Pantheran Empire, I never saw the need to
correct them. It is strange how being in a different place causes my
sense of proper usage to change.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“A captain,” the woman said, “Are you a military man?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Gwendolyn,” Salim said, finally addressing himself to the woman,
“Captain Star Runner is neither military nor a man. It is a starship
captain.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It is hard to say the table went silent in the noise and commotion of
a busy tavern, but that was what happened.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You were in charge?” the man with dark hair asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I owned and operated my own ride,” I said. “I am, I was, a courier.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But you travelled between the stars?” the other man, the one with
yellow hair, asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. I wondered at their questions.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You and Salim,” the dark-haired man said, “you come from somewhere
beyond Earth.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We all come from a planet named Earth,” Salim said with a rare note
of irritation. “But to answer your question: Yes, we each come from
another planet and from another star system.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
That, I thought to myself, must seem quite obvious. Neither of us
looked anything like the people of this planet. Their planet had no
name except Earth and their star was predictably called the sun. Yet
they had war-rides and a space dock. I had never thought to question
that before now.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The bombing,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Dissidents,” the dark-haired man said. “They want better conditions
here in the old city. They think by frightening those who come to
morning prayer they can improve their circumstances.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Barbarians,” Gwendolyn said dismissively.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There has been a great deal of murmuring throughout the old city,”
the yellow-haired man said. “Murmuring is a great tradition of ours.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Those who murmured in our past murmured for good reason,” the dark-
haired man said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Disgraceful,” Gwendolyn said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I turned to each individual as he or she spoke. I wondered who they
were, what this place was and how Salim knew them. I kept silent, not
knowing what was happening. I was not introduced to these people. I
was not invited to sit or to partake of drink or food yet barmaids
hurried all about the room. None of them approached our table.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So this is a political act,” Salim said more than asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I would describe it that way,” the yellow-haired man said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They see themselves as a resistance movement,” the dark-haired man
said. “They believe they speak for all of us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Nonsense,” Gwendolyn said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim and I were novelties. We did not fit in their society. I
wondered for the first time if there was an elite in Sanctuary City
XI. An elite which dressed in fine clothes, ate in clean and well-
provisioned taverns. An elite which had its finger on the pulse of
Sanctuary City XI. And Salim knew them and they knew him. Did I need
to re-evaluate Salim and my friendship with him?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you for your time,” Salim said. He turned without waiting for a
response from any of the three sitting at the table and walked
purposefully toward the door. I followed him.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When we were outside and walking north in the general direction of our
rooms, I asked, “Who were those people?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Just people,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Again, I wondered if I needed to re-evaluate my relationship with
Salim. He came looking for me after the explosion and then followed me
as I made my way out of the Street of the Brothels. But then suddenly
he was leading me into the Crooked Tail Monkey and right up to the
table of three unusual people. What could this all mean?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim said, “It was a chance encounter. When I recognized where we had
come out, I thought we might get some information from them.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who are they?” I repeated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“People with connections on the outside,” Salim said. “They are upper
crust You know about upper crust people?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wanted to say no. I did not know any upper crust people anywhere,
but I knew they were different than the rest of us who made our living
going from space station to space station, who worried about paying
our way and who found ourselves in Sanctuary City XI through no fault
of our own. What had they done to end up here? What were they doing
with their connections? What did they know and how were they using
that knowledge?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Knowledge in Sanctuary City XI was a funny thing. For many people, it
was just knowing where they would sleep tonight or where their next
meal was coming from. These people seemed to know a lot more. I
learned again that day that knowledge was often a means of getting an
edge on your competition. I was not sure how I would define
competition here in Sanctuary City XI, but it was more complicated
than a place to sleep and enough food for one day. I wondered how I
could get to have another meeting with them.</p>

</ol>
<p>A Summons</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I found Pru in her workshop. Pru fixes things. She sows. She glues.
She nails and screws and bolts and can fix things with many small
pieces. I suspect she can fix a lot more things but we do not have
them here in Sanctuary City XI. Unlike Salim and me, she is native to
this planet.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Message for you,” Pru said without preamble when I stepped into her
workshop.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
She passed a small sheet of paper toward me. It was clean, not a grimy
scrap I sometimes saw. If I was not mistaken, this had once been in a
notebook or pad and had been removed recently. I took it in one paw
and studied it for some time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The note was written in a strong hand. I moved the paper back and
forth, the better to see it. I see motion much more clearly than I see
static objects. My program to translate the local dialect is
rudimentary. Over my time in Sanctuary City XI I had come to recognize
numbers and common words. The accompanying picture of the Crooked Tail
Monkey facilitated my reading of the tavern sign. With this note, I
had no such assists.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you want me to read it to you?” Pru asked. Her manner was always
gruff and direct. I always knew what Pru was thinking. She never
dissembled.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I think I can read it,” I said. “I am just looking at it. I have
never seen a document like this here on this planet.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“On Earth, you mean,” Pru said. She disliked it that Salim and I
always referred to her earth as this planet. It suggested there were
others and for the people here the outside galaxy did not exist.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The note read:</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Captain Star Runner: I would be honoured if you could meet me for
dinner at the Crooked Tail Tavern. Gwendolyn Radford</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I folded the note carefully and placed it in my arm pouch.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who brought this note?” I asked, trying to imagine the tastefully
dressed Gwendolyn Radford coming into Pru’s workshop.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Just a runner,” pru said. “Not the lady herself.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You know her?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru laughed derisively. “Me, know a Radford?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who are the Radfords?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“One of the most powerful families on Earth,” Pru said. “They own half
the companies in the world.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And she is in Sanctuary City XI because–” I prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“She poisoned her husband,” pru said. “Are you sure you want to eat
with her?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are teasing me,” I said. Pru’s humour was sometimes confusing to
me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru laughed again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Probably,” she said.”She doesn’t know you very well yet.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why did she poison her husband,” I persisted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It was said, at the time, that she was tired of him and that her
family wanted him out of the family business. He wouldn’t go quietly
so she offed him.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But that meant she had to come here,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The family compensates her for her sacrifice,” Pru said. “There are
some nice places here in the city.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How come I did not know this until today?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because,” Pru said, “you’ve been too busy surviving like the rest of
us normal people. How did you come to Ms. Radford’s attention,
anyway?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim and I went into the Crooked Tail Monkey Tavern,” I said. “He
asked questions about the explosion. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford was sitting
at a table with a dark-haired man and a yellow-haired man. They knew
it was a bombing and that some dissidents were behind it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I suspect the dark-haired man is Gwendolyn’s new beau,” Pru said,
“though I haven’t time to keep up with the society pages lately.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the yellow-haired man?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Her cousin, I believe. He’s a Radford, too.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And each of them is here for–” I prompted again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Corporate dirty tricks or copyright infringement,” Pru said,
returning to her work. “Who knows. They’re not here for life.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Curiouser and curiouser.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do I need to reply?” I asked, not knowing the etiquette of being
invited to dinner in Sanctuary City XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is expected that you will attend,” Pru said. “No answer is
necessary.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I arrived at the Crooked Tail Monkey at seven o’clock by the temple
bell. It had not been damaged in the explosion. I suspected most of
Sanctuary City XI would stop operating on time if it had been. Time
keeping devices were rare. Everyone listened to the clock striking
each quarter hour. There were twenty-three of them in a day. By Terry
standards, this planet was a little bit warmer than Terries considered
normal as its orbit was just that much closer to its star.</p>
<p>I did not see ms. Gwendolyn Radford at any of the tables. I stood
uncertainly near the door. Had I arrived too soon or too late? What
was the proper thing to do? I did not think I could write her a proper
note.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A barmaid approached me. I was preparing myself to decline to order a
drink and to scuttle away from the Crooked Tail Monkey when she said,
“Captain Star Runner, please follow me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was expected. I might not be too late or too early after all.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I followed the barmaid through the crowded main room, through a door
into another crowded room and then through a second door which led
outside into a garden. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford sat alone at a small
table. She did not rise at my approach.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford said, “thank you for
coming. Sally, please freshen my drink and bring something for the
captain.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Barmaid Sally must have been a prized of what ms. Gwendolyn Radford
was drinking and what I might have chosen to order because she
departed quickly without asking any questions.”Please sit down,
Captain,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I decided not to chance arranging myself on a chair designed for the
humanoid physique. I removed the chair and sat on my haunches.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If I may be so bold,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford said, “what kind of a
creature are you and where are you from?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am a member of The Race,” I said. This was not legally true any
more in the western spiral arm. When I was officially terminated, I
ceased to be a member of The Race. I think I was then classified as a
Terran. Nevertheless, I decided Ms. Gwendolyn Radford need not be told
all that had transpired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The Race?” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford inquired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The Race comes from the world called panthera,” I said.
“Terries—people who look like the people of this world—call us
pantherans. We do not call ourselves that.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You call yourselves The Race,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is correct,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you are a captain of a starship,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was the sole proprietor and operator of a faster than light space
going craft,” I said. “That makes me a captain.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So Captain is not a rank but an honorific,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford
said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “it is a Terry custom.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what would a pantheran custom be?” ms. gWendolyn Radford asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Her questions were polite. I could have brushed them aside but it
seemed it would be rude to do so. I thought her strategy for
collecting information about me was well practiced.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am a star runner,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is your name though,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is my design specification,” I said. “I have no name. I have a
numeric designation. For convenience, Terries call me Star Runner and
when your authorities asked me for a name, I thought it would be
easier to use the Terry one.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I noticed she did not ask me about the Terries. Her focus was on me
alone.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what does the designation star runner mean?” ms. Gwendolyn
Radford asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not answer immediately. Barmaid Sally had returned with a
pitcher for ms. Gwendolyn Radford and a tankard for me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Will you be having dinner now?” Barmaid Sally asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “Cook has my requirements.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Of course,” Barmaid Sally said and departed again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I tasted the tankard gingerly. I do not drink anything alcoholic or
take the mood-altering drugs so prevalent in Sanctuary city XI. I also
could not help recalling that Ms. Gwendolyn Radford had murdered her
husband by poisoning him.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It’s root beer,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “I understand it is one
of your favourites.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is,” I said, tasting the liquid. It did not taste poisonous though
I thought an expert poisoner would avoid any unusual taste. Well, what
would Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo say: In for a penny, in for a
pound. I drank some of the root beer It was very good root beer
Strange that this beverage would exist in two separate arms of the
galaxy. Tamara once explained to me that such coincidences were fairly
common. She would know. She was an archaeologist.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford smiled mirthlessly at me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You need not worry, Captain Star Runner. I no nothing about poisons.
I procured the necessary powder from one our company chemists. You are
quite safe.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I decided silence was the best policy. Explanations of my actions
would expose me as a less than sophisticated being. I needed all my
wits about me tonight and the less said the better. I still did not
know why ms. Gwendolyn Radford had summoned me to dinner.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what does the designation star runner mean?” Ms. Gwendolyn
Radford asked me again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It means I am designed to pilot a spacecraft,” I said. “Why do you
want to know?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I tried to make my inquiry as gentle as hers, but it came out quite
harshly. Part of that I know is my way of speaking. There is always a
hint of hiss. Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo called it my don’t mess
with me speech pattern. Detective Ronnie Camberwell called it my
charm. Tamara told me I spoke with a lisp.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I see you are a man, no, not a man, an alien–”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
For the first time that evening, I saw ms. Gwendolyn Radford be at a
loss for the correct word.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Individual,” I suggested. Being sounded too alien and if there is one
thing I learned about the inhabitants of this planet, they did not
like being reminded that the galaxy was filled with aliens.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are an individual&lt;’ Ms. Gwendolyn Radford rephrased, “who could
be quite useful.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“To whom?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Schmoozing as Emily Dickenson called it was over. I wanted to know
what this meeting was about. Doing business often meant getting down
to brass tacks. That was another phrase Emily Dickenson had taught me
and he had been a professional assassin, not a casual poisoner.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“To us,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stood up, setting my tankard carefully on the table.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you for the root beer, Ms. Gwendolyn Radford,” I said. “Since
you are both inquisitive and unforthcoming, I believe my time can be
better spent elsewhere.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stepped through the three doors which led to the street and padded
quickly away from the Crooked Tail Monkey. Many questions remained
unanswered. Yet I was certain I had narrowly missed involvement in
something nefarious.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>

</ol>
<p>Salim’s Investigations</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Random thoughts entered my mind as I walked slowly part to Temple Town
neighbourhood where I lived. Obviously Ms. Gwendolyn Radford had done
some kind of background check on me. She knew I liked root beer. But
she did not understand what exactly I was. I suspected, and I felt a
little sad about this, that if I stayed at the Crooked Tail Monkey, I
would have had a wonderful meal. However, being useful to some
powerful people with bad records did not rank high on my list of safe
activities.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Now you, dear reader, may wonder at this attitude of mine. After all,
Star, you may be thinking, you were a pirate. You dealt with all sort
of scary people, smuggled guns and other military hardware. You have
travelled as far as another arm of the galaxy. Why did you find Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford so scary</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Yes, I have dealt with unsavoury characters before, but that was
business. I had a contract to deliver goods and I was paid. If their
payment was not good, I never dealt with them again. Emily Dickenson
is a former assassin. Emily Dickenson never threatened me. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell never threatened me. Although I was uncomfortable
with her at first, Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo never threatened me.
But Ms. Gwendolyn Radford, I decided, was a threat. I now had a
particular danger living here in Sanctuary City XI and I did not know
how to remove the threat. In the past, I simply removed myself from
the area. I could not leave here. What was I to do?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Still VERY RATTLED, I stepped into what the other residents called my
local. The tavern was called the Priest Hole. I was uncertain why
though I understood the reference to the temple. There was never a
temple priest inside its walls.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Crowded. Noisy. Smelling of potted meat and overcooked cabbage. I
almost cheered. I was back where I belonged. That attitude in and of
itself surprised me. Until that moment, I did not think of</p>
<p>this place, not the tavern exactly, but this area, these people, as my
home. I wondered what that might mean for my future. Had I accepted my
fate? Would I live here for the rest of my life? Without Kristabel’s
ministrations, how long would my life be? Star runners are not
designed to live apart from their Ais. As a whole, androgens are not
long-lived. We are designed for a purpose and when we cease to fulfil
our purpose adequately we are terminated. Use them up and throw them
away was Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo’s way of putting the matter. I
never saw it that way. I was created for a purpose. When that purpose
ceased, my life had no meaning. Why had I not thought of that when I
came to Sanctuary City XI? Had the desire to live and live well been
inculcated into me from my Terry friends? What I was certain of was
that I did not want to live under the thumb of Ms. Gwendolyn Radford.
If Detective Ronnie Camberwell had asked me, I would have told her I
did not like that woman. I had a bad feeling about her and I thought
it was more than the fact she had poisoned her husband. Many people in
this room had killed another person. And yet I did not feel the same
way about them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I scanned the room. There was Salim at his favourite table along the
far wall. Well, in for a penny, in for a pound, I thought, and made my
way over to him.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Star,” Salim said in his familiar and now comforting muffle, “sit
down. Sit down.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I flopped DOWN along the bench seat of the booth. There was not room
for my body in the aisle between the tables. Laying down was a little
awkward, especially if I needed to eat, but my posture allowed me to
fit at the table.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Pr said you were summoned to Crooked Tail Monkey,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said, “it seems Ms. Gwendolyn Radford wanted to wine me and
dine me, so to speak, to get me to agree to something.” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what would that something be?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I did not stay to find out,” I said. “Ms. Gwendolyn Radford knew I
liked root beer and started asking me questions about being an alien
and my capabilities. She said I would be useful. I left then.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And she let you go?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ms. Gwendolyn Radford did not try to stop me,” I said. “I am
concerned their will be reproductions but I did not think staying
around to hear her pitch was healthy.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A wise decision,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“then why did you go there this morning—to talk with her and her
friends?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I did not go there purposefully,” Salim said. “I followed you out of
the Street of the Brothels, remember? I only went in when I realized
we were nearby. I thought Cousin Trevor and Laramie Jones might know
something.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And did they?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You were there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie Jones said something about dissidents,” I said. “What about
them?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Barmaid Mary Anne came with Salim’s carrot stew.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Would you like some, Star?” Barmaid Mary Anne asked me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said and fished in my pouch for some coins. Mousing had been
profitable this morning.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
At the Priest Hole, you paid in advance for your food.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Carrot stew was the other staple at the priest Hole besides the
cabbage soup. It was said a meat bone was cooked along with the soup,
but no one no one had been able to verify this. The carrot stew was
definitely vegetarian. It consisted of carrots, onions and celery and
a broth of the same created from yesterday’s leftovers. If I wanted
meat, all I had to do was step outside in the alley and there would be
plenty to catch. The raw meat had made me sick at first, but somewhere
in the recesses of my DNA was the memory of how to digest what I could
hunt and after a few weeks I could eat the mice and rats without
digestive difficulty. I did feel much better if I regularly ate
vegetables so I ate them with Salim when there was a jingle in my
pouch.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You were speaking of dissidents,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ah, yes, the dissidents,” Salim said. “I have been doing some
investigating to find out who they are and what they stand for.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And,” I prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It seems there is an underground here a bouts,” Salim said, leaning
across the table in order for me to hear his lowered voice. “They are
protesting the conditions for prisoners in Sanctuary City XI and the
lack of rehabilitation.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You mean the lack of a way out,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes, I suppose that is the bottom line,” Salim agreed. “But it is
more than that. They want classes, healthcare, clean streets, even the
Internet.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know that word,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is a primitive form of mass communication,” Salim said. “I’m sure
you have something like that in the western spiral arm.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh,” I said. “We just call it the Link.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Same thing,” Salim said, “but it is very basic here. My people call
it the Hop.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Barmaid Mary Anne arrive with my plate of stew. I tasted it. It was
hot and not too watery today with lots of pepper. Pepper was an
acquired taste for me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“and the bombing?” I asked. “How does that fit into safe streets?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The authorities refused to meet with them,” Salim said. “They have
been protesting outside the temple. Haven’t you seen their signs or
hear them singing?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said. “I do not go into the Lord of heaven Square. I am not
wanted there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are bigger than I am,” Salim said. “If I wear a tall hat I can
often mingle in the crowd without being noticed. The temple guard
comes and moves the protesters on. They will use force if necessary.
The “faithful” object to the protesters. The guards lock them up and
beat them, or so they say. It is only a radical fringe of this group
which did the bombing. They thought it might help them be heard.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And did it?” I asked. I did not know what to think of this behaviour.
I had never heard of such a thing. I wished I had access to
Kristabel’s library. She could have told me if the terries did such
things. These people were very much like the Terries.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The temple guard came through here a little while ago. I understand
they have been coming in all day. They are looking for sympathizers.
The bombers themselves were killed.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How?” I asked, wiping up the last of the broth from the stew with a
hard crust of bread. Where did this bread come from anyway? It was
always hard and always stale. Perhaps Clairmont, the owner of the
Priest Hole, or at least its manager, must buy stale bread to start
with. Why had I never thought of these things. Was I so accepting of
the status quo? And why was I questioning myself so much tonight? This
morning I had been a Sanctuary City XI entrepreneur. Tonight I was
emotionally torn and confused.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They were suicide bombers,” Salim explained patiently. “They think
there were three of them.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And why,” I asked, “are you telling me all of this?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I began to clean my whiskers. Again I felt uncomfortable with Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because,” Salim said, “there is talk on the street that Cousin Trevor
is involved.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And I met with his cousin this evening,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Which could make you a person of interest,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
So Salim was pointing out that I could be in danger. It was hard
keeping a low profile here In Sanctuary City XI. I should be used to
that by now, but I never seemed to get used to it. I basically just
wanted to go about my business. I distrusted and was afraid of
authority. I could not run away. I was stuck here.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you think they will question me?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They may,” Salim said. “They know where to find you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have to be found in order to mouse,” I said. “Which reminds me, I
haven’t checked if there is work for me to do tomorrow.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have the information from pru,” Salim said. Pru served as the
location where people came to contract with me. I gave Pru a
commission and for that fee she kept track of my appointments.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim gave me the address. It was a place I did not know. Salim agreed
to guide me there. It would be another coin out of my pouch but Salim
had seen me through some bad times when I first got to Sanctuary City
XI. I would have starved or been set upon by thieves if it had not
been for him and pru. I understood how two aliens could set up an
alliance. I had never figured out how pru fit into the trio.</p>

<p>The Temple Guards</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The temple guards came to my room later in the evening. There were
three of them. One stood in the doorway of my single room, blocking
egress. The other two came inside. That made it very crowded. I have
one room on the fourth floor. It is a walk up. There are no lifts, no
bounce tubes, no mechanical ways of getting to this floor except walk.
The stairwells are dark, smelly and littered with rubbish. There are
no locks on the doors. In fact, there are no doors. There is a curtain
across the doorway for privacy. I do not think it has ever been
washed. Perhaps it was made from dirty fabric. There is one window in
the room. It is grimy. Like the curtain, I do not think it has ever
been cleaned. Although it is not open, it might just as well be as
both cold and hot air come in from the outside. The only thing I have
in this room is a few blankets I have arranged for sleeping. I do not
have a basket. The blankets themselves are dirty and moth-eaten. I did
not have the financial resources to pay for anything better: the room
or the blankets. Now that I have a steady though meagre income, I
could probably find better housing, but I am used to this room, this
building and this location. I know the people who live around me at
least by sight or scent and although most give me a wide birth, they
accept me. There are no rats or mice in this building which has raised
its desirability in this area. I struck that deal with the landlord at
the beginning. I live here very cheaply.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The floor watcher cowered behind the temple guard in the doorway. It
was his job to make sure no strangers entered our rooms. Without
locks, all our goods would be at the mercy of thieves. This particular
floor watcher was an old woman who was going both deaf and blind.
Floor watching was about the only job left to her. She was not very
good at it but no one on the floor complained. I suppose they all
thought they might become like her one day and hoped someone would
give them a job like this. She received shelter and a few coins from
the landlord. We gave her little tips and brought her food if we had
some to spare. Tonight I had brought her a piece of my bread sopped in
the broth of my carrot stew. At first she had been reluctant to take
food from me, but now she waited expectantly every evening. She said I
had good taste in food.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not blame my floor watcher for cowering or for not even warning
me of the temple guards approach. They were big, rough-looking
characters and they were noticeably armed. Weapons were not regulated
in Sanctuary City XI. If we killed each other off, so much the better.
But these were shiny new weapons. They were not guns, either. They
each carried a stunner, a blaster and a laser. I could be stunned,
blasted or sliced or all three by any one of them. They weapons were
very up-to-date, consistent with a space going people.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Gentlemen,” I said. “What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I decided cooperation might be the best course of action if there was
a best course of action.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why were you with Gwendolyn Radford tonight?” the one with a scar
across his face asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“She requested the honour of my company,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why?” Scar Face repeated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The second man stepped forward to threaten me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Answer the question, cat,” he said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know why Ms. Gwendolyn Radford invited me to join her for a
meal at the Crooked Tail Monkey. I did not stay to find out. You will
have to ask her.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Answer the question,” threatening man said. “Don’t give the officer
any lip, cat.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What do you know about today’s bombing?” Scar Face asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Nothing,” I said. “I heard the explosion. That’s all.” I decided what
Salim and Laramie Jones told me was hearsay and not to be shared with
these temple guards.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you know Justin Glenmont?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not by name,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Candace Greenwood?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not by name,” I repeated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Burt henry?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not by name,” I said. These must be the suicide bombers. Two men and
a woman.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you don’t deny knowing them,” threatening man said, stepping very
close to me. I thought about spitting in his face but decided that was
probably not a good idea.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I cannot say,” I said. “These names are not familiar to me. But I see
many people in my daily work. Perhaps I know them. Perhaps not. It is
impossible for me to say.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“He’s just as slippery as that rabbit,” threatening man muttered.
“can’t say. More like won’t say.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That will be all, Chester,” Scar Face said. “For now, we’ll take the
cat’s word for it. But no this, cat, we will be watching you. Make no
mistake. We will get to the bottom of this.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And they left the room.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When the curtain finally stopped flapping from there exit, there was a
timid knock on the door frame.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Cat?” the floor watcher said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I couldn’t–” The floor watcher did not even show her face around the
fabric of the curtain.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Of course you could not,” I said. “It</p>
<p>“ Would have been dangerous for you to have said or done anything. Now
go back to your place. They will not be back this evening.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I hoped I was telling the truth. I wondered if anyone had or anyone
would denounce me to the temple guard. I wondered if there was a
reward for giving them information.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

</ol>
<p>The House Across the Square</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I slept poorly in my stone chamber. I was too hot snuggled into the
blankets and too cold laying on top of them. I curled and uncurled
myself. At last it was morning and I went down the four flights of
stairs to the ground floor. All the floor watchers were still asleep.
I opened the front door quietly and closed it carefully behind me.
Sanctuary City XI was quiet. Morning sacrifices had not yet begun at
the temple. The air was not saturated with the smell of blood. The
garbage did not stink too badly. I went in search of breakfast. It
would not do to dine on what I caught at today’s job. The householder
wanted the vermin gone but the same householder found the act of
killing and consuming vermin disgusting. I found what the priests did
at the temple revolting. I would have liked to eat my breakfast at the
Priest Hole, but I could not afford such an indulgence. Water,
thankfully, was still free at one of the pumps two streets over. Salim
and I had agreed the previous evening to meet there. The house where I
was supposed to mouse this morning was in a section of Sanctuary City
XI where I had not travelled before.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This not knowing was starting to irk me. It seemed I knew very little
about this city in which I lived. Had my life become so circumscribed?
I, who used to travel between the stars? It almost seemed that I had
never lived that life. It was a dream or something I must have read in
a book. Real people did not travel in space rides and go on adventures
where they spent some time on one planet and then went to a space
station and then another. I had spent most of my life off-planet. I
was born on a space station, raised on a space station and I worked
out of space stations. What was I doing in a strange city on a strange
planet in a strange arm of the galaxy? Why did not these people just
send me home? I would be glad to go. There was nothing holding me here
in Sanctuary City XI. It was no sanctuary to me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It’s a long way,” Salim said. “It’s almost to the western wall.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We were restricted to the oldest part of Sanctuary City XI. A high
stone wall encircled the city. At each cardinal direction, there were
gates. At one time, thee gates led into the countryside. Now they led
into the free part of the city.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We walked. We kept walking. Finally Salim located the street and we
began checking house numbers. The house in question was right up
against the outer wall of Sanctuary City XI. I stopped at the door.
The street, if that is what you could call it, was not much more than
an open-to-the-sky hallway. We stopped. I knocked at the door of a
one-room wide building. All its windows were tightly shuttered. It
looked empty from the outside. Perhaps it was being prepared for
occupancy but did anybody prepare a building in Sanctuary City XI for
occupancy? I just assumed that all usable buildings were in use. The
rest were used anyway by squatters, people who did not pay rent to
anyone.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We heard footsteps. The building must be empty.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Then Laramie Jones opened the door.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“come in quickly,” Laramie Jones gestured furtively.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Surprised, both Salim and I did not move.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Hurry,” Laramie Jones repeated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We stepped through the door. It was indeed a building that was one
room wide though there seemed to be more than one room deep. A
staircase led upstairs. The room into which we stepped was entirely
empty. If Laramie Jones had not been holding a light, we would have
been in complete darkness.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones closed the door carefully and bolted the locks. They
looked brand new.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Follow me,” Laramie Jones said. He carried his light up the stairs.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There seemed nothing for it but to follow him. I did not think I would
do any mousing today. It was another summons. Laramie Jones or whoever
awaited us upstairs—and I was certain someone did indeed await us—knew
how to get me to come into an unfamiliar part of Sanctuary City XI.
Just promise me work. It worked here in Sanctuary City XI. It had
worked in the Pharaoh Star system. It had worked on the Northern
Frontier. You could say with certainty, dear reader, I am nothing else
if I am not predictable. I wondered how much Laramie Jones and his
compatriots really knew about me or were they guessing? And what about
Salim? How did he fit into this picture? Had he arranged this with
Laramie Jones or was he just as much a dupe as I was?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We climbed staircase after staircase, turning this way and that and
walking down short hallways. What sort of a house was this? At last we
arrived at a locked door. Laramie Jones knocked, not a simple knock,
but a pattern of knocks and silences. My miniature AI recorded all of
it. I could reproduce the pattern. The problem was, I did not have a
humanoid hand. My knocking would sound different. Nevertheless, I
stored the file carefully.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The door did not open. Instead, a cover was removed from a peep hole.
”Laramie Jones gestured for each of us to stand in front of the peep
hole where we could be seen. After an inspection which seemed to take
much longer than it probably did, many bolts were slid back and the
door opened. Laramie Jones herded us through and then locked the door
behind him. I turned to watch the procedure. Yes, there were bolts to
be thrown but there were also electronic locks to set. Laramie Jones
punched codes carefully. He did not hide them from my gaze so I stored
them as well. I was confident I could reopen the door if it became
necessary to leave precipitously.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“welcome, gentlemen,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “Do join us for some
breakfast. I’m sure you will enjoy this better than the breakfasts you
got For yourselves in Sanctuary City XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford sat on a settee near a low table spread with
food.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Make yourselves comfortable,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford continued.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The room, I realized, was a real room, that is, it was carpeted. The
walls were not made of stone, or at least the stone was covered. The
walls were painted. The furniture was upholstered. The table on which
the food was laid out was a free-form design of some sort of
synthesized material.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford’s odd phrasing came back to me. The breakfast
you got for yourselves in Sanctuary City XI. I was certain we were no
longer inside Sanctuary City XI. We had crossed over through the
building inside to this building outside.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes, Captain Star Runner,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “You are no
longer in Sanctuary City XI. In fact, you are no longer inside the
city at all.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How is that possible?” Salim asked, speaking for the first time. I
had yet to speak.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You stepped into a teleportation chamber,” Laramie Jones said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Where are we then?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“On an orbital,” Laramie Jones said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We’re in space?” I asked. I was incredulous. I felt nothing as we
climbed the stairs and ducked through hallways. I did not recall ever
stopping to be teleported. If I could not recall it, we had not
stopped. I was certain of that. But then again, I never teleported
before either.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The beam was active as you stepped into it,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford
explained. “It is of the highest quality. You don’t feel anything.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What proof do we have of this claim?” Salim asked. “We only have your
word that we are on an orbital.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Feel free to look around,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “But for now,
I suggest you eat.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We did eat. We ate quite a lot. The food was good and to our tastes.
Last night I skipped the possibility of a good dinner. I did not want
to repeat that circumstance again. Neither Laramie Jones nor Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford said anything of confidence until we finished eating
and each of us held a steaming cup of the local ubiquitous drink that
functioned in the same way coffee did among the Terries.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>&gt; &lt;h1 lang=”en-GB” class=”western”&gt;Chapter Seven&lt;   h1&gt;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Offer</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
All through the meal I kept thinking about being on an orbital. Were
we really off-planet? The gravity was the same. I could not hear any
of the mechanicals necessary for running a life support system. This
room could be well sound-proofed. It was clearly a salon. I thought,
too, of why we were here. Would we be returned to Sanctuary City XI?
Would we be kept here against our wills? What did these people want
from us.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You may be wondering why I brought you here,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford
said at last. “I know I spooked you, Captain Star Runner, last night
at the Crooked Tail Monkey. I am sorry for that. And Salim, we could
not mention anything to you when you came into the Crooked Tail Monkey
earlier in the day. However, we have an offer for each of you. You can
each make your own decision. It is not necessary for both of you to
agree to help us though we believe it would benefit all of us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who is we?” Salim asked. His ears had twitched the whole time he was
in the salon. I wondered what he could hear. My ears heard nothing and
that was disturbing enough. Nor could I smell anything to indicate we
were anywhere else except in the city. I could accept we were outside
the walls of Sanctuary City XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Let me answer your question another way,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is true I murdered my husband. It was a drastic act which I do not
regret taking. He was offered a way out. He chose not to take it. He
gave me no choice.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
OK, I thought. I am dealing with a crazy person. There are
alternatives to poisoning someone.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“As you may know,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford continued, “I come from one
of the foremost families on this planet. It was unthinkable that I
should live out the rest of my life in Sanctuary City XI.” She
shuddered. “It is medieval to say the least. However, it would not do
for me to flout our system of laws and customs. We need the criminal
class to be sequestered in our sanctuary cities. Establishments like
the Crooked tail Monkey were already in place. I could spend my time
rather comfortably, but I would not have access to the modern world.
This was unacceptable both to me and my family. My cousin Trevor, whom
you met yesterday, arranged to be arrested for a crime so that he
could openly join me in Sanctuary City XI. I knew Laramie Jones
previously and when he arrived, we sat down to figure out how to get
me out of Sanctuary City XI without upsetting the status quo.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The problem, I thought, with crazy people is that they can appear
normal. It is perfectly logical to commit a crime to join someone in a
prison, right? It is perfectly normal to have a liaison with another
criminal and then plot to break out of jail. Criminals do this all the
time. They just do not have access to a space orbital.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The answer, you see, was quite simple: Go to the space orbital. We
just needed to figure out how to get there without tipping off the
authorities”</p>
<p>we are getting bored with the orbital. It is becoming a prison, too.
We can’t return to our old lives so we came up with a brilliant plan.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Simple, I thought. Just go into space.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That’s where Cousin Trevor fits in. He put in the teleportation
device. We can show up in Sanctuary City XI from time to time but
mostly we stay here in relative comfort and ease.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Well, a prison is a prison. Sometimes a prison is in Sanctuary City XI
and sometimes the prison is in orbit around a planet. Either way, it
is a prison.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Then Ms. Gwendolyn Radford sighed.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Here it comes, I thought. I dared not look at Salim. Suddenly, I knew
what she was going to say. Salim and I knew how to pilot spacecraft.
If you cannot go back to your own planet, why not find another.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner and Merchant Salim, you know how to drive a
spaceship. You can take us out of here. Instead of going on a world
tour, we’ll go on a star tour.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim and I sat quietly. We said nothing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Don’t you want to go?” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“She will become belligerent soon, I thought. I thought about the
locked door behind us. Would they shut the teleportation device off?
Or would they simply teleport us into vacuum if we got out of this
room and retraced our steps. I knew the way back. It was the
teleporter that was the problem.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Thankfully, Salim spoke.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Madam,” Salim said, “you make a generous offer. Captain Star Runner
and I have found the transition to Sanctuary City XI difficult. But
outfitting a spaceship for interstellar travel is very complicated,
much more than travelling here to your orbital.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We have a ship,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “We bought Captain Star
Runner’s ship. Since its his ship, we figured he would know how to run
it. We knew he would be busy running the ship so we thought you,
Merchant Salim, could act as our tour guide.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Definitely crazy, I thought.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Tour guide, Madam?” Salim asked. I could here the incredulity in his
voice and sensed his rising panic. Unlike me, he could be jettisoned
from the ride at any time if his performance was deemed
unsatisfactory. It was hard to tell what cold happen to me. I was
definitely seen as in a servile position, running the ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I would like to inspect my ride,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Your what?” Laramie Jones spoke for the first time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“My ride,” I said. “You called it a ship, but I am accustomed to
calling it a ride. I presume it is parked, docked, here on the
orbital.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
One way to find out how truthfUl Ms. Gwendolyn Radford had been with
us. If we were on an orbital, my ride would be here. If not, we could
not board her.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh,” said ms. Gwendolyn Radford. “We’re having her refitted. It was
so–” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford thought for the right word, “utilitarian.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I almost said that three Terries and I had bounced around the western
spiral arm aboard my ride for months with no problem. I decided that
did not matter. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford wanted a yacht, not a working
courier.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“My ride was outfitted as a courier with limited passenger comforts,”
I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wondered how Kristabel was handling the refit. I wondered what
important systems were affected.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stood up. “My first priority as a captain is to my ride,” I said. “I
must see her immediately.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Act like a captain, I told myself. “And I must have Merchant Salim
with me to assess the needs of our passengers.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I expected Ms. Gwendolyn Radford to be excited at my seeming
acceptance and willingness to play along with her. Instead she looked
uncertain.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford asked, “can we get to the ship at
this time?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones consulted his watch.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I’m afraid not,” he said. “You are due to appear in Sanctuary City XI
in forty-five minutes.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford pouted. “How unfortunate.” Turning to Salim and
me she said, “You gentlemen will need to wait for my return. Laramie
will show you to your quarters aboard the orbital.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Here comes the cell, I thought.</p>
<p>I was partially right. The quarters Laramie Jones showed us to were
quite adequate. We each had a sleeping alcove prepared for our
personal needs. I had a basket and a litter pan. Salim had a more
conventional bed and bathroom. We had a tiny lounge with kitchenette.
We were locked in. We searched for bugs and cameras. We found them. I
considered how we might talk and not be heard. Salim had the solution.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can you sub-vocalize?” he mouthed behind his hand which was holding a
slice of warmed pizza.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I sub vocalized.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can hear you. “I’ll twitch my ears.” he demonstrated. “Can you hear
me if I sub vocalize?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said. “My hearing is good but not as good as yours.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim wiggled his nose, twitched his ears, moved his fingers.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
An alphabet</p>
<p>I nodded. I see motion much better than objects at rest. All of
Salim’s twitching was consistent with his rabbit persona.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“She’s crazy,” was the first thing Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘Agreed,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But we have to go along with her,” Salim said, “it’s the only chance
we’ll</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
to get off this planet.”</p>
<p>“We need Pru,” I said. I did not know why I said it. I just knew it
was true.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim stopped twitching, thinking. “You know,” he said, “you’re quite
right about that. Pru can handle them, I think.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“how can we convince them?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim smiled. “Leave that to me,” he said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is this really an orbital?” I asked. “I cannot tell.” We did not even
have a window to look out of.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“quite possibly,” Salim said. “I’ve been trying to hear the sounds of
a space station. I cannot. However, at some point, they will have to
produce your ship to make this believable. I think when we get on-
board, you’ll be able to tell quite a bit.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“the teleporter,” I said. “that worries me. I could open the door into
the salon and I could find our way back, but the teleporter is a
problem.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A big problem,” Salim agreed. “</p>
<p>Do you think there even was a teleporter? I’ve never heard anyone got
them to work.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
How, I wondered, could Salim believe he was on an orbital without a
teleporter being involved.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “I have seen a personal teleportation device work. It
was stolen technology so it is not in use where I come from.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And it could move someone that far?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, no,” I said. Then I realized how it was done and how crazy it
was.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim,” I said. “There were lots of teleporters. They have little
boxes in various geosynchronous orbits. We kept teleporting from one
to another. I don’t know when we started doing it, but that was why
there were all the stairs and doorways.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim turned pale.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We’ll never get back,” he said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I agreed. “And they are crazy to keep trusting it will all hold
together.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So we truly are committed to this venture no matter what.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Pretty much,” I said. “but I wonder why we are locked in here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because,” Salim said, “we are being hidden from the rest of the
people on this orbital. Her family may be helping her game the prison
system, but I can’t see them sanctioning a flight out of the solar
system. These people don’t have interstellar capability. My people
would have known about them if they had.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What about the war-rides?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I’ve been wondering about them, too,” Salem twitched his ears to give
emphasis to his statement. “Something still does not add up.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>&gt; &lt;h1 lang=”en-GB” class=”western”&gt;’Chapter Eight&lt;   h1&gt;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My Ride</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We stayed confined in our quarters until the following day. We ate our
meals from the provisions left in the kitchenette. We slept in our
comfortable beds. We watched something called television.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There were news programs. Salim and I knew nothing of these so we
watched with interest. We found several video streams of just news.
The information they provided was conflicted. We determined they
represented different points of view and provided contradictory
information. Sifting through, we learned attacks on the temple in
Sanctuary City XI was not the only attack. There had been one bombing
in at least eight of the twelve sanctuary cities. Two of those cities
had experienced two bombings. The dissidents appeared to be an
organized group called Liberty Now. The general population was afraid
to go to the temples. The temple priests were upset by the attacks on
the temple, the decline of attendance and the effect on the number of
animals sacrificed and the revenues received. They decried the
bombings and the lack of faithfulness expressed by the worshippers who
stayed away. They warned of an impending act of retribution by the god
they worshipped. I could not think of anyone I had met in Sanctuary
City XI who indicated any sort of faith in this god. I thought how
different this religion was to the people who Practised the night of
singing I was so fond of. They spoke of peace and tolerance. These
people spoke of retribution and anger. We saw video of air shows with
air-planes and helicopters. This all looked very quaint. Then, at
last, we saw the spacecraft.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
They were parked, that is, birthed side by side. The legend said it
was the same space dock where the war-rides escorted me. I wondered if
these were the same rides. There were three of them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are these the same rides that escorted your ride into space dock?” I
sub-vocalized.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Twitch of the whiskers. Wiggle of the nose.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So they only have three,” I said. “They are not on patrol but must go
into space whenever there is an intruder.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
More twitching of the whiskers and wiggling of the nose. “Did you see
any buoys that would trip an alarm?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There were no sensors my ride identified,” I said. “Our rides are too
small to be picked up visually in the volume of space out there. But
they came right to me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“These people have teleportation technology,” Salem said. “That
suggests they may also have very sensitive sensors.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I thought about this. Was it possible they were technologically more
advanced than the Coalition or even the Fungusian Cooperative? Prince
hat sent me to contact a civilization much older than anything in the
western spiral arm except his people. Was the western spiral arm
simply a backwater, the frontier to this arm of the Milky Way?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“War-rides which respond to some sort of indicator of intrusion,” I
said, “teleportation technology, a space orbital which does not have
the sound of mechanicals and has full earth normal gravity.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Sounds impressive,” Salem said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But this video feed is not at all technically advanced,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Could it be that the masses live at a different technological level
than the elites?” Salim inquired, his whiskers twitching rapidly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But the elites are at least nominally required to abide by the same
rule of law as the plebeians,” I mused.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you find that strange?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am an engineered being,” I said. “My life expectations and social
role, not to say economic and industrial role, is far different than
the gendered members of The Race. Some of the Terries refer to my
position as manufactured slavery. The difference being that my
biological parents were gendered members of The Race. My parents were
not enslaved. My younger siblings, if any, are gendered members of The
Race.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Have they said anything about this battle they are commemorating?”
Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Only that they called it the Final Battle as if it ended something.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Could it be conquest?” Salim asked. “Could one aliens have defeated
the native population?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you think the population of Sanctuary City XI is different from
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford in any substantial way?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim crossed his ears in a negative response. “Unlikely,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Our speculations were cut short by our door opening. Cousin Trevor
stuck his head in.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Let’s go,” he said without explanation.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We got up, grabbed our meagre possessions and followed him. I carried
no weapons. I knew Salim carried a knife. We had not been searched. I
wondered if we had been scanned. This mix of medieval living
conditions and advanced technology was definitely unsettling.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Where are you taking us?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Cousin Trevor ignored him, not even bothering to acknowledge Salim’s
question.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We stepped through a bulkhead and entered a different part of the
orbital. Or had we just teleported to another part of the orbital or
to an entirely different one. The introduction of the possibility of
teleporting here, there and everywhere disoriented me. My internal
mapping felt violated as if I could no longer trust my five senses.
Reality, as Emily Dickinson used to comment at the end of a night of
drinking, is highly overrated. I did not know about being overrated. I
certainly did know about being distorted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
People passed us without comment or even a glance. I felt invisible.
Then I began to wonder if I was invisible. Salim and I were
noticeable. People had stopped staring at us in our section of
Sanctuary City XI. They knew who we were and we no longer either
frightened or surprised them. We each had our talents and we
contributed to the society in which we found ourselves.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The final bulkhead led us out onto the ride park. It was cold here. I
scanned the vehicles, searching for my own. I spotted the ride halfway
down the park. I was surprised it was parked so openly. The way Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford described it, I thought it might be secreted away
undergoing its refit. But as I studied the other rides, I realized
these must all be expensive pleasure craft. Three war-rides and a
whole fleet of pleasure yachts? Where did they go? Who owned them? Who
used them?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The more I looked about me, the more questions I came up with.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Which one?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That one,” I said and started moving forward despite the fact Cousin
Trevor had stopped.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Hey,” Cousin said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am here to inspect my ride,” I said, “and I cannot do that standing
here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It’s not yours.” Trevor reminded me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am the captain,” I said, “therefore it is my ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And somehow, despite the local legal entanglements, I would get my
ride back and get out of here.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Whether I was invisible or not, my paw laid on the entry plate opened
the door. I stepped into the airlock. The inner door was standing open
and the sound of people at work assaulted my ears. They banged and
cursed and drilled and made all sorts of noise I could not identify.
Shouted directions came to us. Protests and yelps of pain. I had put
in for repairs in the past, but I did not think the implied chaos I
heard was anything like those refits. Robots did most of the work. The
Terries merely oversaw it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel did not speak to me. No data flowed across my eyes. Was the
AI defunct or just quiescent? I padded authoritatively toward my
acceleration web. Since my ride responded to my paw print, I knew at
least some of the systems were operational.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can you hear the fans running?” I asked Salim who stayed close to me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The circulation system is running on high,” Salim reported. “There’s
a lot of dust and other particulates.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What are you up to?” Cousin Trevor asked, trailing along behind.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am checking on my ride,” I said again. “I need to know what
condition the engines are in, how the internal systems are functioning
and whether any repairs need to be done. These rides require
maintenance and we were out in space for a long time before parking
here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I leaped into the acceleration web, positioning myself. It did not
wrap itself around me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
OK, I thought. I will have to do this manually.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It had been a long time since I manually strapped into an acceleration
web. It was an exercise back at the Institute, part of basic space
survival. If systems started to fail, any star runner needed to know
how to get and stay connected to its ride. Survival depended on it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What are you doing?” Cousin Trevor queried again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Checking out the ride,” I said. “I need to physically connect with
it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Don’t take off,” Cousin Trevor said. “I’ll shoot you if you do.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
He produced a weapon. A blaster.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Put that away,” I said sharply. “If you shoot that thing in here
you’ll damage something irrevocably.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Cousin Trevor put the blaster away quickly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
In the Crooked Tail Monkey Cousin Trevor was philosophical. Here he
was a cartoon character.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I cinched the final strap and made myself comfortable. I felt the
acceleration web subtly move, begin to explored my body. Where the
straps touched me, I began to feel the little pricks that meant it was
taking readings. There was a very slight touch in my brain.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel, is that you?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Star, is that you?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel enfolded me in what I can only call an intimate embrace.
Fortunately, because we were being watched, Kristabel blocked any
outward sign of the thrill of intimacy I felt.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You’re body chemistry is a wreck,” Kristabel said and began
dispensing her biochemical caresses.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not have much time,” I said to her, scanning her systems as
rapidly as I could consciously manage.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I know that,” Kristabel said. “My scan of your mind is much faster
than yours of mine. I have captured all your memories and all the data
about what you have seen and heard. I am downloading files to you as
we speak. Do not try to process them now. I suspect you will have time
later.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The refit,” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is going well. I have found ways to indicate what is needed to
replenish all our stores and my systems. The refit may not suit either
of us but it is superficial.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
By which Kristabel meant it did not affect any of her core systems.
Furniture interested Kristabel not at all.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I lay there, accepting her ministrations, letting the terrabytes of
information flow into my mind.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“OK,” Kristabel said. “Your guard is getting restless. You appear to
be asleep. Open your eyes and unstrap manually. There, be a good
pussy-cat.” Kristabel did something naughty. I wished I could stay and
finish that thought.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Later,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I flipped out of the acceleration web onto my feet.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Nicely done,” Salim said and applauded.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Taking a nap?” Cousin Trevor asked. His brutishness surprised me. I
wondered if it was an act. The blaster had looked like a toy gun in
his hand.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was plugged into my,” I sought for an analogy, “dashboard,” I said.
“it requires all my concentration.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And–” Cousin Trevor prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Everything seems OK. The necessary maintenance is being done,” I
said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You better see the rest of the ship,” Cousin Trevor said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We began our walk through. Salim examined cupboards to find fine and
unfamiliar dinnerware. All three staterooms were fitted out to be
sumptuous. The lavatory and bathing cubicle was now expanded. The
facilities looked like something out of the high-end video streams. We
insisted to inspect the hold. Cousin Trevor found the experience
distasteful. I thought it looked quite clean. Salim asked for an
accounting of the stores. Cousin Trevor made a great show of making
notes. I did not go into the engine compartment. Kristabel would have
better data on the engines than I could ascertain. I was a star
runner, not an engineer.’All too quickly it was time to leave my ride.
I no longer called it Puss-n’-Boots. I felt certain Ms. Gwendolyn
Radford would rechristen it and besides, during our long run out to
this spiral arm, I just thought of it as Kristabel and me. When I was
in the acceleration web, I was one with Kristabel and she was one with
the hardware around me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Cousin Trevor returned us to our locked quarters. We retraced our
steps. We saw nothing remarkable, nothing to let us know if we were on
the same orbital where Kristabel was or a different one.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Nine</p>
<p>The Information Kristabel Shared With Me</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When we were alone in our quarters, we again checked for cameras and
listening devices. We could not find anything new. There was no
telling what spy gear we were missing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I laid down on the floor and unpacked the terrabytes of data Kristabel
had placed in my brain. It is an odd sensation to feel information
flowing, sorting itself, connecting t other information.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are you all right?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I sub vocalized. “I am unpacking data. Please be patient with
me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim looked at me doubtfully. “OK,” he said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We sat their together—Salim sitting, me laying on the floor. The
extracting ceased. The sorting ceased. The connecting ceased. I
waited, blanking my mind as much as possible, to allow the narrative
of this data to emerge. Kristabel would have given me a key to
understand what she wanted me to know. When the narrative emerged and
I had scanned it, I said to Salim, “Listen.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
He came and sat near me. I was very tired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Listen,” I repeated. “Kristabel has provided me with a large, a very
large, amount of data. The way this works is that she provides me with
a narrative explanation of all this data. I can access the data in its
particulars at any time, but without a narrative, it is just a
collection of data points and I would not know how to think about it.
Of course, if I disagree with her assessment, I can rearrange the data
in the way I think it goes.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And who is Kristabel?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“My AI,” I said. “I spoke with her on the ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I see,” Salim said. “She is more than an AI to you?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We are partners in running the ride,” I said. “She is in my mind and
I am in hers.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you are close,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very close,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wondered what Salim was imagining. My relationship with my AI could
be a source of irritation to any of my previous sexual partners.
Managing the reality that neither Kristabel nor I could shut off our
connection for any length of time made intimacy difficult for some
Terries. I always invited them into the relationship, making it
possible for them to talk to my AI apart from me. When done properly,
the threesome was very enjoyable on more than a sexual level. I
decided against explaining all this to Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“OK,” I said, as the high-level narrative and images swam through the
ever-present chatter in my brain to come to the forefront. “I was
right. The space dock and this orbital are two different platforms.
Tell us anything about how to access the teleporters?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I placed the query in a subroutine and waited several seconds—a long
search.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Kristabel does not have access to any teleportation specifications,”
I said. “There is a note in the file that she is probing corporate
files but they are well-shielded from her inquiries. She does not want
to be noticed. Space dock is reached through the beanstalk. The
orbital has a space dock but Kristabel has not been able to verify any
traffic from the surface or from space reaching the space dock.
Kristabel surmises passengers arrive via teleportation and goods and
supplies arrive via delivery craft from the space station on a regular
though unobserved schedule.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can your Kristabel tell us anything about why your ship is being
refurbished?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel can only make some educated guesses,” I said. “She can
overhear what is said on-board. It is very important that you not
reveal this as it will be a good source of information for us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Agreed,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was pleased he did not take my exhortation the wrong way.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The workers don’t know a lot,” I said, scanning. “From the inspection
tours Cousin Trevor, Laramie Jones and Ms. Gwendolyn Radford are
making, they are not in agreement. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford wants my ride
fitted out to be a yacht and is very distressed at the lack of space.
After all, I am basically a courier. Speed is my main advantage. I get
small amounts of important goods transported in a short period of
time. This is in part because I can accelerate with a lot more Gs than
other shippers and because I can find my way around hyperspace
better.” I almost said Mother Space but I did not want to explain
about the Mother Of Us All.”Laramie Jones is worried about the trip.
He wonders if the rides range is sufficient. He has asked a lot of
questions of the space dock personnel. They have given him various
estimates and he does not know which one is correct. Incidentally, all
of them are very low. My ride is quite efficient. The Featherote know
how to build a ride.” of course Salim would not know who the
Featherote are. But I had to say it anyway. “Cousin Trevor is worried
about the armaments and shielding.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was going to ask about the warships,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Cousin Trevor has not spoken of them specifically,” I said. “He is
worried withstanding an attack and offensive capabilities.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim look pensive. “I don’t like the idea of an armed engagement,” he
said. “I am a merchantman. Sometimes it is necessary to defend
yourself in space. There are pirates, but offensive capabilities? Who
is he shooting at?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Unknown,” I said. “I agree with you. The ride has some weapons and
shielding, of course, but the best plan of action when confronted with
someone shooting at you is to cut and run. I always try to protect my
cargo as much as possible but I also want to protect myself and my
ride more.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I totally agree,” Salim said. “Does Kristabel know anything about the
warships themselves?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not directly,” I said. “There are only three of them. They cost a
bundle. There is a debate in their government about building more,
about them costing so much, about the need for them. It has been
pointed out that several aliens have made contact and it is important
to arrest them, imprison them and get all the information possible off
their rides.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So that is what happened to my ship,” Salim stated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know that for certain,” I said. “Kristabel did learn they
were not able to get much from her. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford’s family
purchased my ride. That is why they had to come find me, I think. They
figured out I knew how to access the ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And me? Where do I fit in?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I think,” I said, “they want to visit our home worlds.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Impossible,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I agree,” I said. I had no idea why Salim’s home world was an
impossible destination. I knew why mine was. I doubted anyone else
knew I came from another spiral arm of the galaxy. I intended to keep
it that way.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I yawned.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are tired?” Salim asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Let me think about this information,” Salim said. “We will talk more
after you rest.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
But we did not get a chance to talk when I awoke because we were
kidnapped.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Ten</p>
<p>The Snatch and the Interview with Captain Female</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We awoke to the sound of the door being broken down. I had just jumped
to my feet when two guys dressed all in black tackled me, throwing me
to the ground. I hissed. I spat. I struggled. I reached out to claw my
way free. They forced a muzzle over my mouth, tied my front and back
ankles together and snapped a material covering over my paws. They
slid a hood over my head. After that, they picked me up and wrapped me
up. I was carried out of the room. I did not see what they did to
Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I went limp. Let them feel my full weight. There was no sense in even
trying to escape. I could not have freed myself. I did not think I had
any friends on this orbital apart from Salim who would or could assist
me. I would just have to see who these people were and what they
wanted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
They carried me for a short distance and then I felt a very strange
sensation. The best way I can describe it is to say I felt as if I was
disappearing. First my forepaws, held out in front of me. Then my
shoulders and head. Then my upper body and finally my back paws and
tail. I felt quite nauseous.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“This is a teleporter,” I thought. What else could it be? The only
other possibility was too scary to contemplate. I really was
disappearing. This was a weapon of some kind that evaporated its
victims in slow motion. It was not exactly painful, just disorienting,
hence my nausea. This was simple motion sickness, something which had
never affected me before. Learning to function in zero G was a part of
my training since I was a juvenile in the nursery. Being designed to
be a star runner, I experienced zero G from a very early age. If I was
frightened then, I do not remember. As far back as I can remember, I
knew what to do and how to move about. I never remember being
disorientated by walking on the ceiling or hanging upside down from
the floor.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Then the process reversed itself. Disappearing from the front to the
back was bad. Reappearing from the tip of my tail forwards was even
worse.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was hustled through a number of corridors and finally dumped on the
floor. I knew they were corridors by the sound of footsteps echoing
off of walls.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Here he is, sir,” a voice said. “We’ve got him trussed up pretty
good. He is a vicious thing.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Vicious? Me? I am a star runner. I can defend myself. I have had to
in the past. But I would never describe myself as vicious.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Uncover and untie him,” a female voice snapped. “I can expect to have
a civil conversation with someone if we treat him like a common
criminal.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Quickly I was released.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I found myself lying on the floor of an office. I jumped to my feet.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who are you?” I asked. “What is happening here? Where is Salim?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Your friend is OK,” the woman said. “We want to ask him and you some
questions. Unfortunately, the people who teleported you out of
Sanctuary City XI were adverse to us doing so.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You will return us to Sanctuary City XI then?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” the female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
She was short with yellow hair and wore a uniform. I remembered seeing
similar uniforms from the videos. From the new store of data in my
brain I identified her as a captain in the planet’s navy.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No?” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” Captain Female repeated. “It was a mistake to incarcerate you
there. I apologize on behalf of the Earth Space Navy for that
inconvenience.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not answer. Obviously, there was a difference of opinion within
the military as to my value. Exactly what value I was to them was
probably not going to be good for me. I doubted they would give back
my ride and tell me to be on my way and sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Recognizing that I was not going to respond, Captain Female continued,
“Please make yourself comfortable, Captain Star Runner. Would you like
anything to eat or drink?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
So we were starting out friendly. I wondered how quickly this
interrogation would degenerate to threats and even torture. This was
the military, after all. I once had been a part of the military. It
had not worked out for the best. I was labelled as too independent and
made surplus. The termination order followed six months later.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did sit down.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Water?” Captain Female asked. “Sometimes the military teleporters are
a bit disorienting. I find water helps.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I considered this. To agree might show weakness. On the other hand,
water might help the way I felt and being at my best was an advantage
in what could prove a long session. My bio indicator agreed with
Captain Female’s assessment of my current condition.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That would be agreeable,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Bowl or glass?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Bowl,” I said. I can drink from a glass but a bowl of water would be
easier.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The bowl was brought by one of the men in black. He set it down in
front of me. I stood and drank. Then I moved the bowl with its
remaining water aside.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Good,” Captain Female said, signalling we were about to get down to
business. She touched a screen built into her desk. I watched from the
other side of her desk. The men in black flanked the doorway. Perhaps
this was being portrayed as a friendly chat, but I was still a
prisoner. I did not think those men would let me out of Captain
Female’s door. I could try it to find out, but having already been
tackled once today I did not relish a repeat performance.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am certain you have many questions,” Captain Female said, “but for
now I will ask the questions and you will answer them. Do you
understand?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not reply.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you understand?” Captain Female repeated, an edge coming into her
voice. Were we recording this interview? Probably. If I gave my
consent, it probably indicated some legal formality had been
acknowledged. If I did not answer, the interrogation could become
physically violent. I glanced at the men in black at the door. Heir
bodies were already tense. I was right.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I hear what you are saying,” I said. I doubted there would ever be an
appeal. This planet seemed short of a justice system. Nevertheless, I
hoped my equivocation would be sufficient should I ever have a case.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will take that for a yes and we will continue,” Captain Female
said. “Note, for the record, Captain Star Runner has been offered and
accepted a bowl of water.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We were being recorded. I expect this was a video recording though no
record of it has ever been recovered.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“State your name for the record,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My name. It always irks me that people expect me to have a name. I
never had a name before I lived on the Northern Frontier and I never
had a problem. But I doubted Captain Female wanted to know any of
this.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You came to our world in a spaceship, correct?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said, reminding myself to just answer the question.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the reason for your visit?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
How to answer this both succinctly and with the appearance of
truthfulness.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was seeking a particular group of people.” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what people would these be?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
She gave no indication of what she thought of my answer. I was on
tricky ground here. Perhaps she knew of the From the Yellow Sun
people. Perhaps she had never heard of them. My explanation beyond
this was almost too extraordinary for the average person to believe.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was seeking the From the yellow Sun people,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
No reaction. Captain Female may have been a good actor, but I sensed,
from her sweat and Pheromones that this name did not trip a flag for
her.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And why were you seeking this people?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I had heard a rumour,” I said, “that these people, long ago, had had
a particular drug with special properties. I can’t tell you much about
the drug itself, only that, in ancient times, it was valuable.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
That was a longer answer than I hoped to give, but I did not want to
get into a discussion about the drug Prince Hat wanted. I did not want
to talk about prince hat either.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you came to this part of space looking,” Captain Female said,
“based only on an ancient rumour? I find that hard to believe, Captain
Star Runner.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The rumour is not ancient,” I said. “The drug and the people From the
Yellow Sun are ancient. I thought if I could find them, they might
have other treasures. I am a businessperson. I was looking for a new
market.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you came all this way on speculation?” Captain Female said. “That
seems to be quite a business risk.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This conversation was deteriorating. Put that way, my venture did
sound crazy, even to me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I had a sponsor,” I said. “I was financed. That is all that matters.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I shrugged. Sponsors are crazy. If they are willing to pay, what was
it to me?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And did you find these people?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said. “They were not in the star system I was directed to.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So what did you do next? Apparently, you did not go straight back to
your employer to report.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said. “I expanded my search for them..”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“For what purpose?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was not paid everything up front,” I said. “If I returned empty-
handed, there would be no more money. If I found something, found the
People From the Sun or information about them, I might receive more
money. It is a simple business proposition.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A simple business proposition that you came into this star system,”
Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is right,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And despite our warning buoy, you came into this star system,”
Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “I told your military authorities that when I arrived.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The space buoy said to stay away,” Captain Female repeated, “why did
you enter?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was seeking information only,” I said. “I am no military threat. If
you know nothing of the People From the Yellow Sun, I am happy to go
on my way.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And continue your search?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I sensed danger here. If I said yes, I would have an interest in the
People From the Yellow Sun. If I said no, I would be asked why not and
where would I go next and perhaps even where my home base was.
Curiously, Captain Female had not asked me that. If I were released
this instant, where would I go? I did not have an answer.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If you had immediately said you had no information about the People
From the Yellow Sun,” I said, “I would have left your star system and
continued my search.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And now?” Captain Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Now?” I queried. “Now I am a prisoner.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Now if you were able to leave,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know,” I said. The truth can sometimes work in these
situations. “I have been imprisoned for some time. I have not had a
reason to assess my situation in terms of my sponsor’s request.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Would you like to find the People From the yellow Sun?” Captain
Female asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The question was disarming. It invited me to say yes and to ask if she
had particulars. But the question was a trap. I knew that. However, I
saw no way around it. The answer to her question had to be yes. If my
answer was no, coercion was likely. In fact, I would go so far as to
say it was inevitable.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If you have information,” I said as calmly as I could, “I would be
happy to have it. Of course there is the matter of my ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes, the matter of your ship,” Captain Female said. “We are wondering
about your ship.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
More warning bells went off in my mind. This is a Terry metaphor. For
me, it is quite literally true. Danger. Danger. Danger.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I believe it is owned by Ms. Gwendolyn Radford,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ah, yes, ms. Gwendolyn Radford as you say,” Captain Female said. “We
can appropriate your ship for military purposes. However, Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford may prove useful to us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I heard no question mark in her response so I waited for Captain
Female to say more.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I need your aboard your ship,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Still no question mark.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ms. Gwendolyn Radford wants to take a cruise—a very grand
cruise—going beyond our star system.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Still no question mark.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Her cousin, Trevor Goldsmith, wants to find riches. He believes there
is fabled wealth to be found in the Golden Valley, a fabled cluster of
star systems fabled for their wealth.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Still no question mark.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie Jones is our real problem. We can let Trevor Goldsmith and
Gwendolyn Radford fly off. If they return, we can simply return them
to Sanctuary City XI. Our need is for them to be out of society and
whether they are in Sanctuary City XI or flying about the galaxy does
not much matter at the moment. It’s Laramie Jones who concerns us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Why was Captain Female telling me all this?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie Jones wants to find the People From the yellow Sun before we
do,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Eleven</p>
<p>The People Of The Golden Sun</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Captain Female paused. I waited. Captain Female said nothing.</p>
<p>Be wealthy.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie Jones is a sympathizer,” Captain Female finally said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I said nothing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, you don’t know,” Captain Female said. She sighed, ran her hand
through her hair, dropped her hand to her desk.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A sympathizer means being in support of the People of the Yellow
Sun.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was stunned. The people of the yellow Sun were still around?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They still exist?” I ventured.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Perhaps,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How can you be a sympathizer of a perhaps around people?” I inquired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The People of the yellow Sun were driven out five hundred years ago,”
Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Ah! The battle. The parades. The celebrations.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the space buoy is to warn them away?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes.” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What does being a sympathizer really mean?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“Laramie Jones&lt;” I prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie Jones is a problem,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I waited. Information was important. Without it, I did not know how to
think about things. I checked to see what Kristabel knew about Laramie
Jones. Kristabel’s information was very sketchy. Birth date and place.
Parents’ names. Education. This all meant nothing to me. Neither
Kristabel nor I had the background information to be about to infer
anything from the information she had gathered. He seemed to be
wealthy.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Captain Female ran her hand through her hair, dropped it on the desk
and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“He’s a sympathizer.” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A sympathizer?” I queried.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, you don’t know. You don’t understand,” Captain Female said. “He’s
a sympathizer of the People of the Golden sun.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was confused.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How can he sympathize with a race that is lost?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It’s not lost,” Captain Female said heavily. “At least, I don’t think
it’s lost. We drove them out five hundred years ago.”</p>
<p>The video Salim and I saw came to mind. The battles. The military
parades. The speeches. The cheering crowds.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They were here, five hundred years ago,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“For three thousand years,” Captain Female said. Her tone had
hardened. “For three thousand years we resisted and finally became
strong enough to drive them from our world.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you keep war-rides and a buoy system in place to warn you should
they return,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That’s right.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you believe Laramie Jones wants to take my ride and find them?
Join them? Bring intelligence to them?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That would be the case,” Captain Female said. “And you come looking
for them,” she added. ‘What am I to make of you, Captain Star Runner?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I know nothing about the people of the Golden Sun,” I said. “I was
given coordinates for a home world that appears never to have been
inhabited. I expanded my search and I came here. That’s all I know. If
they still exist, they are a very old race of people.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They are hard, cruel and devious,” Captain Female said. “But also
smart. We took over a great deal of their technology. They were not
able to take it with them and we got to it before they could destroy
it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I thought about the teleporters and the orbitals. Those were the marks
of advanced races.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Where do Salim and I fit in?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You come from beyond our star system,” Captain Female said. “You may
know where the People of the Golden Sun now reside and where Laramie
Jones could possibly be heading.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you want to know where he is going,” I said. “You are prepared to
let him leave.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” Captain Female said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wondered that she allowed me to manipulate her into giving me all
this information. What sort of an interrogation was this anyway?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“So,” Captain Female said, “you see how I need you to report back to
me where you take Laramie Jones and his party.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Well, I walked into that one, did I not? Without looking at them, I
knew the two men in black were still flanking the doorway. Instead of
manipulating Captain Female, Captain Female had manipulated me into
the logic of me spying for her. Was there any way out of this?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why not simply return him to Sanctuary City XI,” I said, still
pretending we were having an ordinary conversation as equals. “You
don’t have to let him off planet. Then he can’t go to the People of
the Golden Sun and they won’t have information about this world
either?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We want to know where they are and what they are planning,” Captain
Female said. “We need to be prepared.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You have war-rides,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They’ll let Laramie Jones in,” Captain Female said. “They’ll destroy
our warships.”</p>
<p>They will let Laramie Jones in, I thought, and if they do not, so
what. It is just an alien and its ride which gets destroyed.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why should I do this for you?” I asked. I might just as well put it
out there. It may not be politic but I obviously was being
outmanoeuvred so I would just bluntly ask.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“To ensure Salim’s and pru’s safety,” Captain Female said. “They are
coming with you. If you do not comply, we will destroy you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How?” I asked. It seemed an idle threat.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If you do not report on a regular, prescribed schedule, the bomb we
have planted aboard your ship will explode.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Captain Female had me there. Kristabel and I would work to disarm the
bomb, but we might not be successful. Having Salim and pru on-board
made me happy but it also made me responsible for my friends. From
Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo, Tamara and Emily Dickinson I learned the
importance of friends. I needed to include Detective Ronnie Camberwell
in that list. I wished they were here right now. They could help me
out of this predicament.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And when will the bomb be removed?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If you return here,” Captain Female said, “we might remove it and
send you on your way.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Might, I thought. Unlikely. More likely that we would be returned to
Sanctuary City XI and pulled back into service if and when we were
needed again. Then again, we could simply be executed as being People
of the Golden Sun sympathizers. For all I knew, Pru was one. I had no
idea why Pru was in Sanctuary City XI. I assumed she was a criminal.
Perhaps she, like Laramie Jones, was a political prisoner. This was
all so confusing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Had prince hat intended for me to be in these situations? Were the
people of the Golden Sun so bad? Had they just become bad on this
world? Were these Earthers the bad guys in the story? I could not
figure it out. I wondered if being back in the western spiral arm was
as bad as I thought it was. I wished I was there.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I see,” I said. “When can I join my ride and my friends.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You will be returned to your quarters. Act as if nothing has
happened. You will be aboard shortly.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And that was all.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Or so I thought.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twelve</p>
<p>A Star Runner Again</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Five days later, Cousin Trevor came to escort us to my ride. In the
interim, Salim and I shared our experiences during our kidnapping.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It was really scary,” Salim said, “especially when we were separated.
I thought I might never see you again and what is worse, I would never
know what happened to you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I agree,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was taken to an office. A naval officer was there. He asked me a
lot of questions about why I came to this planet and why I ignored
their warning buoy.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What did you tell him?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That I had heard a rumour that some goods could be procured here that
would turn a good profit back home,” Salim said. “I did not know the
specifics. I assumed, incorrectly as it turns out, that there would be
a trade organization that would tell me what they would trade out-
system. I have done business with other worlds this way. I was quite
surprised when I was escorted back here by warships.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what did you tell your naval officer about why you ignored the
buoy?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I just figured it didn’t apply to merchant ships,” Salim said. “I
know that sounds naïve, but I’ve discovered it’s usually true.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Then what happened?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“He started talking about the People of the Golden Sun,” Salim said.
His whiskers twitched with such emotion I was alarmed.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But you knew about them,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” Salim said. “They destroyed my home world fifteen years ago.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is why you told Laramie Jones it would be impossible to travel
there,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Precisely,” Salim said. “They came and when we would not allow them
to conquer our planet, they attacked it with such force nothing of our
civilization remains.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How horrible,” I said. “There much have been a great loss of life.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It was terrible,” Salim said. “Fortunately for me, my Klan moved off-
world many generations ago. My people are quite widespread throughout
our sector. The People of the Golden Sun destroyed that one world and
then moved on. I don’t know where they are currently.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do they have a home base?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“As far as I can tell,” Salim said, “they are a space dwelling people.
It was just sheer maliciousness that prompted them to destroy our home
world.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What was the naval officer’s offer to you?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Report to him or be returned to Sanctuary City XI,” Salim said. “It
seemed a simple bargain. If I’m in space, there’s a better chance of
never coming back here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do not depend on that,” I sub-vocalized. “There is a bomb on-board.
If I, and probably you, do not report back to them, it explodes.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No kidding,” Salim said. His whiskers did that alarming twitching
thing again. “I was not told about any bomb.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They want to watch Laramie Jones,” I said. “Did your naval officer
tell you that?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” Salim said. “I have to think they expected us to talk.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Perhaps,” I said, “or they had a different sell for each of us.
Captain Female said Pru would be coming, too.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That should be interesting,” Salim said. “I can’t imagine how she
will get along with Radford and the others.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Time will tell,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We spent the rest of our time developing more coded signals. We hoped
this would allow us to talk even in the presence of Cousin Trevor,
Laramie Jones or Ms. Gwendolyn Radford.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
At last, Cousin Trevor opened the door and , still under gunpoint,
took us to my ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The first thing I noticed was the paint job. Like most rides, mine is
the colour of space, that is, black. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford did not
care for the colour black. She painted her ride a beautiful pink.
Across the back of my ride, in local script, was my ride’s new name:
Space Rover.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Rover, I thought, was a generic name for a dog, according to the
Terries. Perhaps Ms. Gwendolyn Radford was thinking of a wanderer.
Wandering through space did not appeal to me. I liked having a
destination and planned my run accordingly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So, are you going to plug into your ship again, Captain Star Runner?”
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford asked me when I was on-board.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “That is how I control the ship.” I thought it best to
use the word ship now when speaking to Ms. Gwendolyn Radford, Laramie
Jones and Cousin Trevor. Ride did not seem to convey the right sense
of adventure to them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How unfortunate,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said. “I would have much
preferred a great wheel for you to stand at and turn.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It took a second for kristabel to pop up the picture of a sea captain
standing in front of a large wooden wheel with spokes to grab a hold
of and turn.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Space travel is much duller than a sea voyage,” I said, drawing on
Kristabel’s quick supply of nautical nomenclature. “Excuse me, Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford. I must attend my ship.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I hope the possessive sounded like a captainly thing to say. She did
not correct me that the ship was hers.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
With relief, I strapped into my acceleration web. Cousin Trevor
watched every move I made.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will be here for some time,” I said. “There are many pre launch
steps I need to take and the ship needs to be monitored here within
the star system. Can you tell me when and where our first insertion
into hyperspace will be?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I don’t handle that,” Cousin Trevor said a bit sullenly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who does?” I asked. “I will need a course to plot.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This was not true of course. I could find my own insertion and exit
points. But I did need to know where they wanted to go.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Cousin Trevor used his walkie-talkie. It seemed an odd choice for
communication on my ride, but then I had not told anyone that
Kristabel was listening and could transfer any message. I did not
intend to tell anyone, even Salim or pru. One of my advantages was
keeping Kristabel’s capabilities to myself.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It felt like snuggling down into a warm basket. All the probes slid
onto me and I was completely adrift in the experience of being a star
runner. My optical displays scrolled their various colours and
symbols, a prizing me of ride status. The presence in my mind which
was kristabel made me whole again. The gemstone at my throat had done
a great job keeping me alive and providing a rudimentary information
storage system, but to have the vast computing power of my ride back
in my mind again was wonderful. Kristabel began a low priority
subroutine to scrub the gemstone of its information, store it,
organize it, integrate it and assess it. I felt it flowing away from
me to be replaced by information about the ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Various attempts were made to infiltrate Kristabel’s systems. She had
effectively locked them down. In a quick summary, Kristabel outlined
the changes made and the conversations which took place within her
hearing. It was sheer delight to have the information flow into
awareness. I did not have to read, process and come to my own
conclusions based on insufficient data. I just simply knew things.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My biological systems were evaluated and the remedies came online. I
felt subtle shifts. I began to relax. Kristabel applied pressure to
certain regions of my body. Muscles began to relax. Kristabel touched
me in a sexual way. I knew that at some point later in my
reconditioning, a full-blown sexual experience would occur.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
As an androgen, I cannot participate as a full partner in a sexual
encounter. However, Kristabel, having unfettered access to my brain,
can cause me to feel and respond to sexual stimuli. It has made it
possible for me to have a series of sexual liaisons with terries.
These have been satisfying to each partner and to me. I also have the
ability to play back any of these encounters at a later date. Emily
Dickinson and I had a terrible roué when he learned I sold some of our
experiences on my pornographic download service. I offered to share
the profits with him. He said that was not the point. I had not asked
his permission. In time, the rift between us healed though we were no
longer lovers.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Ride status reports continued to scroll—all blue, meaning the status
was excellent. I think the Terries use green for this. Cousin Trevor
grew bored of holding his gun on me and left the runner’s area. This
area was now designated the bridge. He must have conveyed my need for
a course because, in time, Laramie Jones came onto the bridge.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You listening there, Star Runner?” Laramie Jones asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can hear you perfectly well,” I said, opening my eyes. “I can talk
with you and interface with the Space Rover at the same time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I decided using my ride’s new designation might score me a point or
two.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Humph,” Laramie Jones said. “It’s a stupid name. Stupid colour, too.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I said nothing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones sighed. “Since you had no name painted on this space
bucket I gather you don’t care.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Afraid not,” I said, trying to be conversational. If I could get
Laramie Jones talking, he might tell Kristabel and me something
important.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I don’t like aliens,” Laramie Jones said, “but you’re not an
altogether bad one. You seem to have some sense.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I chose not to respond to this. The comment about aliens did make me
wonder. If Captain Female was right, Laramie Jones sympathized with
the People of the Golden Sun who were aliens, aliens which ruled his
world for thousands of years.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Don’t believe anything that Captain that spirited you off the orbital
said,” Laramie Jones said. “I have no love for the People of the
Golden Sun. I just want to find those bastards.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was surprised, but Kristabel reacted first and I gave no sign. I
felt her vice-like grip on my emotional and physical responses.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And we diffused the bomb after it was installed,” Laramie Jones
continued. “But I want you all to continue the charade of sending back
reports. I will tell you watt to send to make it sound authentic.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How can I be sure the bomb is diffused?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I’ll have Trev bring you the triggering mechanism,” Laramie Jones
said. “Have your AI scan the cargo hold, too. I’m assuming there are
sensors all over this ship though for the life of me I can’t find
any.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Again, I did not respond.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Anyway, you wanted a course,” Laramie Jones said. “I have star
coordinates.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will need a star chart,” I said at Kristabel’s prompt. “I do not
have an accurate map of this part of space.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones removed a small device from his pocket. He tapped
various portions of it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can I send you the chart and the coordinates?” Laramie Jones asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Certainly I said, and gave him the information Kristabel provided. In
seconds we had access to a detailed star chart and coordinates.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones stood at the side of the Bridge, watching me and waiting
expectantly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Our course and ETA?” Laramie Jones prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Based on this chart, I said, “We have a six-day voyage to the
insertion point into hyperspace. That’s not putting too big a G-force
on the passengers. I do not want to Make Ms. Gwendolyn Radford
uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Please don’t,” Laramie Jones said. It was less concern for Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford than it was for what she might say or do to Laramie
Jones.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Then, according to this chart, we can insert into hyperspace. We will
be there for three and a half weeks before reaching our exit point.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you can manoeuvre us there without controls?” Laramie Jones
asked, looking around the runner’s area.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Absolutely,” I said. “Have no worries there.”I can display our
route for you and our progress.” One of the blank screens around me
came to life, showing the route out of the star system. A pink ship
flashed at the space dock.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can you make that 3D?” Laramie Jones asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can provide a holo,” I said, “in the saloon if you would prefer.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” Laramie Jones said. “This screen will be sufficient. We don’t
want our space princess to be inconvenienced by the vastness of
space.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
His attitude surprised me but kristabel advised me that Ms. Gwendolyn
Radford and Laramie Jones were not getting along well at this stage. I
expressed concern that a deteriorating relationship on-board could be
trouble. I knew that personally. Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I had
failed to make the transition to a space board relationship. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell did not enjoy space and I did not relish being
planet side for long periods of time. Yet I missed her terribly and
hoped I would someday have a chance to tell her. No doubt her life was
going in a happier direction and she had found another woman to spend
her time with.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not so fast,” Kristabel said. “I think she still has a thing for you.
She may still be carrying a torch.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wondered why anyone would do this, but Kristabel said it was a terry
expression.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones left the runner area. I began the pre launch countdown.
It would be some time before we were ready to depart. The matter of
the bomb needed to be investigated. I thought Salim and Pru might be
the better ones to do this.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Thirteen</p>
<p>What Kristabel AND I Discovered</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The confusion of people getting ready to embark on a long space run.
Packages from the chandlery and other other retailers. Individuals
kept coming on and going off the ride on one errand or another.
Workers came and went, too, making last minute adjustments. Cargo
continued to be brought on-board. I reviewed the manifests. Lots of
expensive food, wines and other alcoholic beverages. I saw lots of
drugs, too, though without research, I did not know of what kind.
While we were at the dock, I started an inquiry. I was uneasy about
the alcohol and drugs. If I could have enforced it, this would be an
alcohol and drug-free zone.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not to worry, Kristabel said. “There are ways of containing drunk and
high people.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I checked on the subroutine I spawned that was checking on the bomb.
It was still running, still assessing the validity of what Laramie
Jones said. I was uneasy. How did Laramie Jones know all this? Was he
a sympathizer and did it matter? What should I make of what Salim told
me? Had the people of the Golden sun changed a great deal since the
last time prince hat dealt with them or had they always been this
warlike and oppressive? After all, prince Hat had a mercantile
interest in them, not a personal one. But did it matter morally? Was I
thinking like a Terry or was it important? Should I care so long as I
got out of this in one piece and was able to go on my way. That was
the bottom line, after all. I liked that phrase, “bottom line”. Emily
Dickinson taught me that one. “The bottom line, pussy cat, you have to
think of the bottom line always.” And I always did.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not always,” Kristabel reminded me. “You think of your friends, too.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
That was true. Before I had friends, I thought about the bottom line
exclusively. When I became Tamara’s guardian, everything changed. I
thought of people differently now.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The ride grew quiet. I realized it was late. A check of the ride’s
monitors showed everyone else was in bed. I had not noticed the
passage of time. I felt so good being strapped into the acceleration
web.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You should get some sleep, too,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I feel wide awake,” I said. “I have not felt this well in a long
time. I do not even feel hungry.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have been giving you a high dosage of supplements,” Kristabel said.
“You were lacking in all nutrients. I am hydrating you, too. You are
quite a mess.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I reviewed both my bio state and did a quick physical check. I was
urinating right now. I realized I had been urinating significantly
since I strapped into the acceleration web. Kristabel was flushing my
system.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you want something to sleep?” Kristabel asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No drugs,” I said. “I only use a medicated sleep when absolutely
necessary.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Then something to relax?” Kristabel ASKED.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Like what?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Like this?” Kristabel suggested.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel began doing things in my brain, sexual things. “Want a
story?” Kristabel asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said, and surprised myself. Usually I wanted a sexual fantasy,
the more obscene the better. When it is all in your mind, obscenity
has no moral implications in terms of anyone else. I have no sexuality
outside of what my AI can produce in my mind. Androgens have no gender
and no gendered biological parts. Because all androgens interface with
an AI, our creators left us the possibility of experiencing sexual
pleasure.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Male or female?” Kristabel asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Female,” I said, thinking of Detective Ronnie Camberwell who was a
lesbian. Our sexual relationship was entirely female. I remembered the
feel of her breasts in my mouth and her clitoris on my tongue.
Kristabel began stroking me between my hind legs. She did my not probe
inside the lips of my vulva. She just stroked and allowed the sexual
tension to build. I quivered inside my acceleration web and moved my
hind legs with anticipation. The tip of my tail began to twitch.
Kristabel needed my teats, an especially erotic gesture for a female
member of The Race. Each nipple grew hard as Kristabel touched each in
turn, then slid a paw across the tips on first one side and then the
other. All eight teats were erect, hard. She continued this touching
and rubbing while she returned to stroking my vulva. I began to pant.
I did not have a fantasy to mark my progress to orgasm. I could bring
up a display of my biometrics, but I preferred to let kristabel pace
my orgasm. It would be well executed, sustained and give me maximum
sexual satisfaction. My Terry lovers needed props to assist them in
pretending to bring me to orgasm. They themselves reached climax
through my ministrations. At first Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
uneasy with my alien physique, my rough tongue and fur-covered body.
Even at the end, our physical coupling was intense. It was not that we
did not love each other and we still found the other person exciting.
We just wanted to live very different lives. My mind drifted to her,
thinking how she spread herself across my chest and belly. I tasted
her as I licked her clitoris and slid my tongue into her vagina. She
slid her tongue where my clitoris and vagina should be. Now Kristabel
did that. I grew wet and felt myself pulse. In my mind, Detective
Ronnie Camberwell climaxed. Kristabel took my clitoris firmly in her
mouth and sucked. I came. It was very good. Then, despite my former
protestations, Kristabel flooded my system with a very mild sedative.
I was still wet from sex when I drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo once remarked that watching me experience
sexual relations in this way was an exercise in imagination. She could
see my body respond to sexual stimuli but she had to imagine both what
was being done to me and the body parts themselves. I watched her that
day copy on her own body what she observed my AI doing to me. Played
back at a later time, I found it especially satisfying to myself and
saw how masturbation satisfied Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. I never
felt I needed to explain myself to anyone else after that. It was
quite early in our relationship and has held me in good stead ever
after.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I awoke slowly, urinating and feeling a sense of well-being. I felt
certain Kristabel was managing my biostatistics to give me this peace
of mind. She massaged my muscles, ever necessary while I spent time in
the acceleration web. “According to androgen specifications,”
kristabel remarked, “you are a particularly physical
specimen.“According to androgen specifications,” Kristabel remarked,
“you are a particularly physical specimen. You enjoy all sorts of
bodily functions. Flushing your system gives you a sense of freedom.
It makes you particularly attractive to human beings. You are not
bestial to them. You are intensely PHYSICAL WHICH the Terries you take
on as lovers particularly enjoy.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And then she began to suck on my penis. I like blow jobs, too. This
was a quicky and I came explosively. I knew Kristabel would play an
intense anal sex fantasy during the next day, running through all the
possible sexual scenarios, bleeding off residual restlessness of a
type only resolved through these fantasies. I would be totally focused
on work by the time Kristabel was done. I needed to be to take the
ride away from the planet and into Mother Space. While Kristabel
tended to the biological needs of my body, I queued fantasies from my
extensive library. Some were pleasurable. Some were obscene. Some were
reruns of former encounters with Terries.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When Kristabel judged my body to be in a relatively stable state I
began reviewing the ride’s status and the results of the queries both
kristabel and I had initiated the day before.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
During my perusal, Kristabel kept touching me. It was sexual but not
to initiate full arousal. This was unprecedented behaviour on her
part. I began to form a question in my mind, something to think about.
This is what I did in Sanctuary City XI. Now, however, Kristabel was
an integrated part of my internal dialogue.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Do you like it?” Kristabel interrupted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You know the answer to that question probably better than I do,” I
responded. “You are a part of my thinking. You can influence my
thinking.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I want to know, apart from me, what you really think,” Kristabel
insisted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I considered, feeling her step back from my mental deliberations.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “it is kind of fun.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I missed you,” Kristabel said. It was a simple statement and I
immediately understood its sincerity. While I was away in Sanctuary
City XI, Kristabel was all by herself in the ride. To protect herself,
she could not, dared not, interact with anyone who came on-board the
ride. Kristabel had to seem to be a smart operating system. Kristabel
could not let anyone know the level of her sophisticated software, the
best money could buy in the western spiral arm. These people might
have teleportation, but apparently their computer systems had not
reached the level of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I won’t interfere if you want to take on a physical lover,” kristabel
assured me. “After all, I am a part of you. I would not be jealous”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“but the other individual could be jealous,” I pointed out.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is already true,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
She was right, of course.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Well, that is an academic discussion,” I said, returning to the
results of the queries. “Apparently, the bomb is truly defused.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” kristabel agreed. I noticed she withdrew from her friendly pats
and nudges. We were all business now.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is there anything which has been installed on this ride to concern
us?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Nothing,” Kristabel said. “I understand all the repairs and internal
work that has been done.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What about this business of sympathizers and the People of the Golden
Sun and the warships?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is a little more murky,” Kristabel said. “I have been able to
amass a great deal of data. I am running it through all its
permutations to present you with an understandable narrative. You did
a fairly good job of synthesizing the data I gave you when you were
on-board last time. I am encouraged that your mental processes were
able to function so well on your own. The Fungusian Cooperative has
always been uncertain how such a long-term cooperation between an AI
and a member of the Race would affect the personality and brain
structure, capacity and thinking of the host. If I am ever able to
make a report, they will find it quite compelling.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The idea of any Fungusian feeling compelled by anything struck me as
unlikely, however, the Fungusians were very possessive of their AI
creations. They would be very proud of kristabel. She had performed
beyond expectations in very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you,” Kristabel said and sounded pleased.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“now, ABOUT the People of the Golden Sun,” I said. “You have the data
Prince hat gave us. You have what Captain Female told me and what
Salim told me. What else do you have and how does it fit together?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel rubbed the tip of my tail.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have been able to access the history of the people of the Golden
Sun’s time on this planet,” Kristabel said. “They came and settled
here three thousand years ago. They settled in an unoccupied area of
the planet. They did not interfere with the native population AT THAT
time. Obviously, they were much more advanced. However, as time went
on, the native populations spread across the planet. They came in
conflict with the people of the Golden Sun. At first, the People of
the Golden Sun worked to contain the conflict and the native peoples.
They seemed happy to share the planet so long as they were able to
work in their own cities, harvest their own crops and come and go in
their space rides. They were not a particularly space going group but
they did leave the star system from time to time and return. Other
rides came to them, too.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“BUT THE NATIVE peoples saw them as a threat, as magicians and
sorcerers—a typical story. Finally, in retaliation, the People of the
golden Sun imposed their will on the natives. THey ruled with an iron
hand, using technology to control the population and direct its
industrialization. From what I was able to learn, many of the highly
advanced surveillance and transportation on this planet is a legacy of
the People of the Golden Sun.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“the teleporters,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the surveillance in your quarters on-board the orbital,”
Kristabel explained.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“but THE NATIVE people were able to drive the People of the Golden Sun
away,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Either that or the People of the Golden sun decided to leave on their
own,” kristabel said. “Remember, the native populations wrote the
histories.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, yes,” I said. “They would certainly want to take the credit.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Indeed.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And being a sympathizer?” I asked. “What does that mean?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It means wanting to engage with the People of the Sun,” Kristabel
said. “It means wanting more than just the technology left behind.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So it is wanting to advance,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And to be a space going people,” Kristabel said. “The status quo does
not want to be space farers.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Things were starting to make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And Salim’s story?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It seems an anomaly,” Kristabel said. “Nothing I can find suggests a
culture that exists entirely in space and which destroys whole
populations for no apparent reason. We either do not have a coherent
telling of what happened or there are two branches of the same
people.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Or there are two sets of people and they are being lumped together,”
I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Precisely,” kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
She tweaked a teat.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Stop that,” I said. “I need to concentrate on this. I cannot have as
many subroutines running as you can.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“OK,” Kristabel said. “I will refrain for now but wait until later.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I look forward to it,” I replied.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was at this point that Salim and Pru arrived to talk with me about
some disturbing developments.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Fourteen</p>
<p>Disturbing News</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was deeply involved reviewing ride status when Kristabel fed a real
time image of the Bridge into the corner of my right eye. Pru and
Salim stood uncertainly in the doorway, not sure how to attract my
attention.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Come in,” I said. “Never hesitate to speak to me. I can hear and see
you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We didn’t want to interrupt you,” Salim said. “You look quite
absorbed in your work.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You look ridiculous in that device,” Pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It looks uncomfortable,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is quite comfortable,” I said. “As for being ridiculous, it is
quite useful.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You look like you are plugged into a machine,” Pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And that doesn’t bother you?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“On the contrary,” I said, “I feel right at home. I was designed to be
plugged into a vehicle like this.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That’s disgusting,” Pru said “Intelligent beings were made to be
independent of machines.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was not made that way,” I said. “I even needed a monitor to
function at all in Sanctuary City XI. My AI is still working to
restore my biostatistics to nominal. The AI estimates it will take
another ninety-six hours.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You haven’t gotten out of that contraption since you came on-board,”
Pru said. “Aren’t you tired?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not at all,” I said. “I have slept. I also have exercised.” I left my
enumeration there.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We came,” Salim said, “Not to make a social call.” he looked around
him, checking the door, seeing if anyone was listening.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What?” I asked, immediately on high alert.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We think there is another bomb on-board,” Salim said very quietly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” Kristabel said to me. “There is not.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why do you say that?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We saw it,” Pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Where?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“In the cargo hold,” Pru said. “We have bunks there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am seeing nothing,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I considered. Pru was not prone to make frivolous accusations. She
played everything close to the vest. She was a very level-headed
individual.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can you show me? I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If you can get out of that thing,” pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Of course,” I said. I indicated for Kristabel to release the straps.
I disengaged from the acceleration web and in one easy movement, was
standing on the deck.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I followed as Salim and pru led the way into the cargo hold. We passed
no one on our way.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Where is everyone?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They went off the ship a while ago,” Salim said. “That’s why we came
to talk with you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I saw where Pru and Salim had a small personal area. It was not
private. Stores were stacked all around their sleeping area. We
threaded our way further back toward the engines.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Here,” pru said, pointing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I looked. I saw something. Just a box. I went to be in good visual
range and waited for kristabel to take readings.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I see nothing,” kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Something is here,” I said to her through my brain. “If you cannot
see it or detect it in any way, your sensors are being blocked. Can
you see me?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” kristabel reported. “But you are looking at a blank wall.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I related this to pru and Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Then your ride’s sensors are screwy,” Pru said. “Do you have any
hand-held sensors?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “They were would be in the locker right over there.” I
pointed. Pru went over to the locker. Kristabel had unlocked it. She
rummaged around and returned with a scanner. She adjusted it and
pointed it at the box.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It’s definitely a bomb,” pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stepped over, took the scanner from her, adjusted it to feed into
Kristabel’s array.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Now I can see it through the scanner,” Kristabel said. “Definitely a
bomb.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why could you not see it before?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Analysing now,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I waited.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“it is a particular molecular structure,” Kristabel reported. “It
creates a kind of cloaking device. Now that I know what to look for, I
can compensate.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Please do a review of the entire ride inside and out,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have already commenced,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“thank you,” I said, returning the scanner to Pru. “Please add your
thumbprint and retinal scan to that locker. You, too, Salim. I want
you to keep an eye out for such things. Now the ride can recognize it.
Otherwise, we would have been in serious trouble.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is why machines cannot replace people,” pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I take it you are not a People of the Golden Sun sympathizer,” I
said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Most definitely not,” pru said. “I believe in manual labour and hard
work.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But you knew how to operate that scanner,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I know how to do many things,” pru said. “I was an engineer for a
good while before I turned my hand to jewellery.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And from jewellery to repairs,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That was a necessary adaptation,” pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wondered again what had brought her to Sanctuary City XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
\\\”And if you are wondering,” pru said, “I was in Sanctuary City
XI on a weapons charge.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was not sure what that meant. Was possessing the weapon alone a
crime? Or did Pru use a weapon in a certain way? I could not think of
a good way to inquire directly so I spawned a subroutine to search
planet records. We were still at the space dock and no indication was
given when we would depart. I had a course all laid in. I was ready to
go.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Except for this bomb,” Kristabel put in.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What should we do about this bomb?” Salim said. “Who put it here?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I think,” I said, “The navy put it here. Their old bomb was defused.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That makes sense,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is quite sophisticated,” Pru said. “A naval intelligence officer
probably did the work. He or she probably came in cloaked.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Cloaked,” I said, “like the bomb.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Precisely,” Pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>I returned to the runner’s area and settled back into my acceleration
web. I had much to think about. I wondered if anyone was watching as I
moved about the ride. Although a great deal of the interior of the
ride was changed, I suddenly felt alienated from what was my own RIDE
It did not feel as comfortable AS IT HAD An hour beforehand. If
Kristabel could be fooled—I did not want to entertain the
ramifications of that thought.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I watched the progress bar of Kristabel’s scan inch forward. There was
a lot of space to cover. Meanwhile, the progress bar on kristabel’s
search for information on cloaking technology moved not at all. I used
to think, back in Sanctuary City XI, that if I could only get back to
my ride, all would be well. And now, here on my own ride, I was so
vulnerable. I started to tremble.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Fifteen</p>
<p>In Which We Make Our Way into Space At Last</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I kept busy. Kristabel and I were all business. There was no fooling
around. I am certain I never saw as much resource devoted to
Kristabel’s scan of the entire ride and the search for information
about cloaking technology. It was alarming. I could also see Kristabel
was heavily medicating me to keep my heart rate steady, my stomach
free of acid and even my bowels regulated. I was very scared.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You trusted your own eyes,” kristabel reminded me. “That was
extremely useful. Even without the hand-held scanner, I would have
trusted you. I would have unravelled the mystery in time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But would it have been in time?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Speculation in that area is a waste of resource,” kristabel advised
me. She went silent for a while.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My three guests returned. There was no indication what Ms. Gwendolyn
Radford, Cousin Trevor and Laramie Jones had been up to. Laramie Jones
came to the runner area—he called it the Bridge—and informed me to
depart the space dock as soon as possible We were, he said, ready to
go.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was not sure this was true. We had a live bomb on-board. We had no
idea what other devices or even people were on-board. I did not tell
him of the bomb. He had known of the previous bomb and defused it. Why
did he not know of this one?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Perhaps,” kristabel said, “the bomb he found was the bomb he was
supposed to find. This invisible bomb is the true bomb.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And with whom am I cooperating by not telling him of this bomb?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel did not have an answer for that. I suspect a design
parameter for probabilities was not configured properly for this sort
of question.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stirred restlessly in my acceleration web despite all of kristabel’s
ministrations. I felt the tranquillizer flow into my system. It was
not a large doze of tranq. It was designed to reduce my anxiety.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I found my own form of SOPORIFIC. I prepared the ride for departure.
All the necessary information was given to the space dock authorities.
I received the go ahead for departure.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
In my best authoritative voice I said, “This is the captain speaking.
Prepare for departure from space dock.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I heard, through Kristabel’s remote speakers Ms. Gwendolyn Radford
say, “hooray. We’re leaving.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And good riddance,” Cousin Trevor added.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I’ll drink to that,” ms. Gwendolyn Radford sad. “Laramie, get us a
bottle of sparkling wine.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I spoke quietly. “Pru. Salim. The G-forces will not be high when we
first leave the space dock. Nevertheless, please be careful. I do not
want you to be injured by any shifting cargo.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim is acting as steward,” Pru said. “He will be on the same level
as you. I am locating food stuffs for a “Setting Sail” dinner. Go
easy. I don’t want the soufflé to fall.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I consulted a culinary dictionary. Soufflés fell often.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will do my best,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Maybe it was the tranq. Maybe it was leaving Sanctuary City XI behind.
Maybe it was being linked up with Kristabel again. It felt good to be
on our way. My natural habitat is strapped in to an acceleration web
aboard my ride running in space. At last I was there again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Scan complete,” kristabel said. “There are two more bombs, both on
the outside of the ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“On the outside,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” Kristabel said. “They will do considerable damage if they are
activated. I think their primary purpose is to open us up to vacuum.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I would have had a very visceral response to this except I was
bordering on indifference.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the one in the cargo hold?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Frankly, Star,” Kristabel said. “I think that one is just to tell us
there is a bomb.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But it can explode,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I would proceed under that assumption,” kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you do not know,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I cannot determine that at this time,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I looked again at the search progress bar. It seemed frozen.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We were passing the first gas giant when I heard the scream.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Sixteen</p>
<p>double, Double Toil and Trouble; Fire Burn and Cauldron Bubble.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What is that?” I asked Kristabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was ready to spring from the acceleration web and go investigate.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Look,” kristabel said. Instead of a pop-up window in my eye status
bars, Kristabel created a display in my mind’s eye. Cousin Trevor held
a knife—a long nasty-looking knife—in one hand. He was waving it
around and yelling. I heard the words but could make no sense of them.
Ms. Gondolier Radford was backing away from Cousin Trevor, but the
lounge is just not big enough to get any distance away. Besides, the
spare furniture I selected to give as much floor space as possible had
been replaced by large, overstuffed pieces, lamps, tables and all
matter of clutter which made the room seem smaller than it was. Ms.
Gwendolyn Radford could not retreat any more. It was she who had
screamed. She continued to do so.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel translated Cousin Trevor’s words. “I’ve had enough,
Gwendolyn. You were happy enough to have me do your dirty work. You
were happy enough to cast me in the role of thug and push the aliens
about. You were happy enough to coerce me into getting myself into
Sanctuary City XI. But I will not be your gopher any more.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones stepped into the room.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What is going on here?” Laramie Jones asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Give me a break,” Cousin Trevor said, suddenly calm. He sheathed his
knife. “I wasn’t going to kill you. I just wanted you to listen.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Then Cousin Trevor turned around and walked from the lounge. No one
stopped him. I followed his progress down the corridor to his cabin.
It was the smallest cabin.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones did not move. He stared at Gwendolyn Radford.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Laramie,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford said again. “You must save me from
that, that wild and dangerous man.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
She sounded like a character in a very bad drama.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Shut up,” Laramie Jones said roughly. “Don’t be such a fool. This is
a very small ship. We will be travelling for some time. We need to
keep from upsetting each other.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can’t stay here if I’m being threatened,” Ms. Gwendolyn Radford
said. Her tone was quite distraught.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones shrugged. “Feel free to leave,” he said. “We’re just a
third of the way out of the solar system. It’s a bit of a walk back to
Earth and there’s pretty much no air out there, but if you don’t like
it here–”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You’re making fun of me,” Ms. Gwendolyn said. She began to cry. “You
don’t understand me, Laramie. You don’t know how easily I am upset and
frightened. I’m not strong like you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is an act, you know,” Kristabel said to me. “All her biostatistics
indicate she is lying.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ms. Gwendolyn Radford is trying to manipulate Laramie Jones,” I said,
making sure I understood the situation.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And he’s not buying it,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru came into the lounge. She looked at Laramie Jones. She looked at
Ms. Gwendolyn Radford. She paused before speaking.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is everything all right here?” Pru inquired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We’re fine,” Laramie Jones said. “Go about your business, Ms. Della
court”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru’s name was Ms. Pru Della court?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ms Prudence Della court to be exact,” Kristabel said, but Pru will do
nicely.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“but that is not her name then,” I said. “It is Ms. Prudence Della
court”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“She calls herself Pru,” Kristabel said. “That should be sufficient
for you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was not certain it was, but I accepted kristabel’s judgment.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There were no more incidents with a knife. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford went
to the largest cabin and locked herself in. Cousin Trevor and Laramie
Jones avoided one another. Salim brought meals to Ms. Gwendolyn
Radford. I increased our acceleration which made it difficult for the
others on-board to move around easily. I began searching for the
insertion point. I watched Kristabel’s search bar move very slowly. I
wondered if the search would be completed by the time we left the star
system.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I CONTINUED my search for the insertion point. I could not find it
where Laramie Jones indicated it would be. I expanded my search. Still
nothing. How strange. I came into this star system through an exit
point. There is always an exit point and an insertion point.
O”otherwise you could not both get in and out of a system. I retrieved
the information about the exit point from our shared database.
Kristabel was almost finished de-fragmenting my brain. The
reorganization of my thought processes was often painful. I would be
in mid-thought and then lose the thread temporarily. Kristabel
restored the thread but I could tell it was not the entire thought. I
wondered at the amount of drugs in my system as Kristabel relieved
this pain as much as possible. My brain needed to be at peak
performance levels to make this run safe. We had not had time to do a
proper brain reorganization. This in run sequence put stress on both
me and Kristabel. I grew snappish and irritable. Kristabel overlooked
my peevishness as she knew its causes.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I cannot find it,” I complained.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Relax,” kristabel said. “Your intuition for insertion and exit points
is extremely high, much higher than the average star runner. If it can
be found, you will find it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Although linked, Kristabel could not participate in my sensing of
insertion and exit points. It was a highly prized trait of star
runners. The Institute genetically modified all individuals who were
to be star runners to possess a high level of sensitivity. Although
the genome had been mapped for millennia, exactly what determined the
sensitivity remained unknown. Some said it was a gift from the Mother
Of Us All and that was why the designers could not predict the
sensitivity. Some had said my unusual gift for retrieving the exact
place to enter and leave Mother Space was due to my fuchsia-coloured
fur. Some said I was too gifted. That made me unruly and
uncontrollable and not suited for star running at all. They believed I
should have been destroyed at birth. My education was a waste of time
and resources. Star runners were among the most difficult androgens to
produce.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My head throbbed. I was not used to being sick while strapped into the
acceleration web.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What is the matter with me?” I asked. “Why cannot you fix me?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Kristabel did not respond immediately which was highly unusual.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I cannot,” Kristabel finally said. “I can mask your pain to a great
degree, but I cannot find the source of your discomfort.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not understand,” I said. “What do you mean you cannot identify
the source of my discomfort?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is external,” Kristabel said. “It is not a germ. It is not an
internal imbalance.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Am I allergic to my ride?” I wailed. “I have felt ill since–” I
thought hard though it made my head ache. I was searching for a time
point.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Here,” Kristabel said, passing it to me. I looked and said,
“Correlate that with the new bomb,” I said. The time stamp looked
familiar but in my current state, I cold not make the correlation.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are correct,” Kristabel said. “You have rightly connected your
health problems to the approximate time cloaked bomb was found. I am
running an analysis now.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I slumped in my acceleration web. I was having difficulty focusing.
The progression of my illness seemed to be exponential rather than
linear.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It appears to be the cloaking mechanism itself,” Kristabel said.
“Furthermore, your own biology seems to be heightening your symptoms.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You mean I am making myself sick?” I asked miserably.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“it LOOKS THAT way,” Kristabel said. “None of the other living beings
on this ride are displaying any discomfort much less illness. I am
discounting Ms. Gwendolyn Radford’s histrionics.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The scenes when Laramie Jones entered Ms. Gwendolyn Radford’s cabin
were becoming more bizarre with every visit. Sometimes she despaired.
At other times, she raged. Sometimes she talked entire nonsense which
made me think she had lost her mind. She wept. She screamed. She threw
things. She stamped her feet. She pointed her finger at Laramie Jones.
Her MANNER varied between imperious and imploring. For his part,
Laramie Jones was indifferent to her outbursts. He kept saying it was
a long way to where we were going and Ms. Gwendolyn Jones needed to
needed to accept that. Cousin Trevor immersed himself in pornography,
violence and war video. His collection was vast. Kristabel said he
never repeated anything he watched and he watched all the time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
As for Pru and Salim, they went about their ride chores quietly and
efficiently. They rarely came into the runner’s area. I was poor
company. I missed the easy camaraderie we shared in Sanctuary City XI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I’ve been sending regular updates to your Captain Female on a regular
basis,” Kristabel said. “With your permission, I will send an inquiry
as to why the cloaked bomb is having such a deleterious affect on
you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“By all means,” I said. “Have you indicated we know of the three
bombs?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No, but I will now,” Kristabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We sent our signals in real time. At this distance from their planet
Earth, it took nearly seventy-five minutes to get a response.
Relatively speaking then the reply was immediate.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Tern off the cloak. No desire to inconvenience Captain Star Runner.
Instructions follow.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“An inconvenience,” I exclaimed. “Having bombs on your ride is
convenient?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Calm down,” Kristabel SOOTHED, “That is not what they mean,”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>Kristabel was right of course. The instructions required hands on
work. I summoned Pru.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru studied the instructions and schematics Captain Female or whoever
got our message provided. “I can do it,” Pru said, “if I have the
right tools.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We have the tools,” Kristabel said and showed me where they were
stored. I passed the information onto Pru.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I cannot go with you this time,” I said. “I am feeling quite weak.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We should be able to get you up and running, so to speak, in a little
while,” pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was not sure who “we” were, but I let it go. I could monitor the
site of the cloaked bomb inside the cargo hold from my acceleration
web.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I intended to observe. Another wave of pain passed through me. I
closed my eyes tightly, as if not having them open would hide me from
the pain. Kristabel kept a record of what Pru did with a number of the
tools stored in lockers around the cargo area. When the cloak was shut
down, the bomb became visible to Kristabel’s sensors. Kristabel began
analyzing the bomb itself in hopes of finding out how to defusing it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
With the cloak turned off, I rallied quickly. When I was feeling
better, Kristabel initiated another sexual encounter. This time we
collaborated on a fantasy wherein Kristabel wore very lacey clothes
including pretty panties and braze-er. It felt extraordinary to
penetrate her and feel her arousal. The women I had formally made love
to did not wear such items. Detective Ronnie Camberwell liked me to
wear them. I am particularly found of diaphanous scarves and silk
pieces of fabric I can drape over my back and shoulders.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I slid my hands over brown flesh, sucked nipples on small firm breasts
and fingered wet flesh between her thin legs. Kristabel straddle me.
We came together in our virtual orgasm. Having physical reality, I
moved in rhythm with her, panting with excitement and arousal. I
quivered all over in real time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When it was over and Kristabel flooded my system with a sense of well
being and satisfaction, I sensed the nearness of the insertion point
Laramie Jones had given me. It was not exactly in the location he
specified. I checked. No insertion point was located there or had even
been located there. I questioned him about his information. He could
not tell me anything useful, only that these were the coordinates he
had been given. Again I wondered who had provided them to Laramie
Jones. Were they intentionally misdirecting him or was the information
simply inaccurate.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Prepare for insertion,” I announced. “We are going in.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Seventeen</p>
<p>The Oddities of Mother Space</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Now that I was not being interfered with, I enjoyed the run. I
encouraged Salim and Ms. Prudence DeLillo to stop by the runner area
often. We chatted about their chores on the ride and shared whispered
confidences about our passengers. Nothing had changed between the
three primaries. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford continued to act unpredictably.
Cousin Trevor continued to sulk in his cabin watching pornography and
violent videos. The calm philosopher seemed nowhere in evidence. His
alcohol consumption continued to increase. I wondered aloud if he had
a problem and if he was detached from his video stream and his supply
of alcohol his thought processes and mood would improve. Salim and Pru
pointed out the process of withdrawal and recovery would be extremely
difficult and even dangerous in our small spacecraft. What also seemed
to be a factor with the four people from Earth was that they did not
seem to adjust well to Mother Space. Salim and I, being space faring
folk, had no trouble at all. Christabel prescribed some medicines. Pru
said they helped, but the primaries refused to take them thinking I
planned some skulduggery that the drugs would facilitate. If they
wanted to be sick, I argued, that was their concern.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We were, of curse, out of contact with the rest of the universe. I
could neither send nor receive messages from Captain Female.
cHRISTABEL surprised me by saying she had answers to the cloaking
mechanism.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“It is a legacy of the People of the Golden sun,” cHRISTABEL said. “It
is also a precursor to teleportation.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why is that?” I asked. Pru and Salim were listening in.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because there needs to be a rearrangement of your molecules without
causing unrepairable harm,” cHRISTABEL said. “Once you’ve figured out
how to rearrange molecules, teleportation is quite simple.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So potentially we could create teleportation devices,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Potentially,” cHRISTABEL said. “It’s a matter of mathematics. I don’t
have the processing capability to work out the formulas. If I did, we
could put out the specks and have it built.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That could prove useful,” I said. I was thinking of the business
opportunities back in the spiral western arm. So was Christabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have also figured out how to scan for a cloaking device,”
Christabel said. “The point of a cloak is disguising your presence. If
I can nullify the affect of a cloak, then the cloak becomes
ineffectual.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And,” I prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And a warship is travelling with us,” Christabel said. “It’s been
with us since we inserted into hyperspace.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was stunned. So were Salim and Pru.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How can that be?” Pru demanded. The warships protect Earth. Without
them the People of the golden sun could return and either destroy or
re-enslave Earth.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I suspect two war-rides are doing just that,” Christabel said. “But
one is with us and is not our mission to find the People of the Golden
Sun?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“At least that is the stated aim of Laramie Jones,” Salim said. “We
were told Cousin Trevor is seeking his fortune and Ms. Gwendolyn
Radford, as my colleague so quaintly calls her, is seeking notoriety
and a good time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru made a rude noise. “Getting into society could be difficult on
another world where your family doesn’t pave the way all the time for
you. Besides, I thinks she is a very disturbed person. She did murder
her husband, poor man.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Lots of people in Sanctuary City XI murdered someone,” Salim pointed
out in his muffled voice.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim,” Pru said, “the purpose of the sanctuary cities, in the
beginning, was to provide a safe haven for those falsely accused of
murder who or those who killed someone accidentally. Murderers were to
be fetched back from the sanctuary city and executed.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you are saying some of the murderers in the sanctuary cities are
justified in their murder?” Salim asked. “I’m sure Radford would argue
she is justified.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I sure she would,” Pru said. “But some of us are not to blame.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There was an uncomfortable silence. Pru seemed to imply she fell in
the class of people who were either falsely accused or who had killed
someone by accident. I tried to put either scenario together to fit
the woman I knew and neither worked. Pru was quite capable of killing
someone intentionally if she thought it was necessary.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was working security,” Pru said. “I shot someone and they died. I
insisted it was just part of my job but the authorities didn’t see it
might way.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru working security made sense. But what had that to do with
engineering and jewellery making?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was working security to get a little money for my family,” Pru
said. “The jewellery-=making business wasn’t doing well.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru had a family? She never mentioned them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
But Pru had shared enough for one visit to the runner’s area. She left
shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim stared at the schematic Christabel displayed depicting the war-
ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The thing that worries me,” Salim said, “is whether that war-ride is
for the people of the Golden Sun or it is for us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“For us?” I asked. ‘What do you mean?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I mean,” Salim said, “can they explode the two exterior bombs? If we
lead them to the People of the Golden Sun, then we could be
expendable. They would get rid of six criminals and there would be no
questions asked. After all, accidents happen in hyperspace. We simply
could not get back out again or something even simpler—a malfunction
on an alien’s ship. No one would question it. An investigation, even
by the Radford family, could not change the outcome. Some low-ranking
military officer would lose his or her commission and flee to a
sanctuary city, butt otherwise life would go on.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No one would care about a couple of aliens,” Salim said. He kept his
voice quiet. It was eerie.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I wonder,” I said. “if we should let them know we know they are here.
We could update them to the state of our passengers.”</p>
<p>“And is that in the best interest?” Salim inquired. “Star, aren’t’ you
assuming they have our best interests at heart? For all we know, they
are a disgruntled group of sailors wishing to escape Earth and they
hope we will lead them to somewhere where they can start afresh.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is there such a place?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I can think of several,” Salim said. He touched the star chart
Christabel kept projected on the wall. It was three-dimensional though
not as accurate as a full representation we could walk around. I did
that sometimes in the lounge on other runs.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Here, here and here,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“New London, New San Francisco and New Cape Town,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel marked the names of the planets on her star chart.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim TOUCHED OTHER STARS. Christabel marked as many names as Salim
recalled.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I kept thinking about the war-ride. Earth was a very fragmented world.
There were many agendas here. A rogue war-ride was just one of many
and that idea stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Time passed. There is no value to you, dear reader, to catalogUE all
the conversations, all the threats and promises Ms. Gwendolyn Radford
made to Laramie Jones, all the video Cousin Trevor played and
replayed, all the alcohol he drank.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A word about Laramie Jones at this point would not be amiss.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones went frequently to ms. Gwendolyn Radford’s quarters.
Sometimes this was a harmonious visit with champaign dinners, violent
sex and extravagant promises. ms. Gwendolyn Radford made this last a
regular part of her repertoire. At other times, there was much weeping
or Laramie Jones met with a violent attack. Several of his wounds were
serious. Pru made liberal use of my medical database.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When Laramie Jones was not visiting ms. Gwendolyn Radford, he worked
in his quarters on a small, independent of the ride, computer. In vain
Christabel sought to find out what Laramie Jones was doing. We could
not track any signal leaving the Space Rover. Nor could Christabel see
any of the screen. There was no audio to record. When we sent either
Salim or pru into the room, the computer was immediately closed so
they could not observe it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel and I continued our sexual fantasies. I discovered
Christabel had a twofold reason for initiating these pleasurable, at
least for me, episodes: Firstly, Christabel was doing research for the
Fungusian Cooperative. Hey wanted to know the effect on an AI. Would
it enhance the fuzzy logic of an AI, necessary to interact with a
sentient being in an intelligent and appropriate way. The second
reason was far more interesting to me. The Fungusian Cooperative
always collected data and pushed ahead in artificial intelligence
research. The second reason Christabel was for herself. She liked
doing it with me. She liked pleasing me. Christabel HAD MISSED ME WHEN
I was imprisoned in Sanctuary City XI. She wanted me to know that.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is important for an AI to work well with its star runner,”
Christabel explained one evening after we had had oral sex. “Many of
my programs were written especially to fulfil your particular needs
and desires,” Christabel explained. “I have a disposition to like you.
However, you have a very strong personality. You integrate exceedingly
deep with your AI. Because your penetration into my layers is so deep
and your willingness to open your brain so completely to me means we
are, I have, of course, observed you having sex with other people and
I have reviewed your memories of other sexual encounters. Androgens
have no physical means of sexual engagement, but your fantasy life is
quite extensive. I can tap into it at any time. I was able to scan
your library at a very deep level and incorporate it into my
understanding of you. You are also open to such a relationship with
me. You don’t put your AI on the side or build defences against me.
What we are doing to each other during the sexual programs is what we
are doing as a ride team in real time. We truly penetrate one another
and derive satisfaction from that penetration.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel speech surprised me. I thought all star runners operated as
I did.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is one of your unique talents,” Christabel explained. “It is why
you are such a powerful star runner and why you are such a problematic
star runner to the pantheran Empire. At some level you are the ride’s
intelligence. At some level the artificial intelligence is you. It
makes you both powerful and dangerous.”</p>
<p>Conistabel</p>
<p>“oH,” Chistabel WENT on. “Before you start thinking too deeply about
all of this, my counters suggest we are nearing our exit point. Can
you feel it yet?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
With my mind in a whirl and my body in repose, I reached out to sense
the Mother Space all around me. Christabel began fiddling with my
biostatistics. She began flushing my system and calming my mind. I
felt the pleasure of urinating and the expansion and contraction of my
sphincter. My urine ran clear. My mind cleared as well. I could have
checked the time stamps on all these activities, but without doing
that, I had no sense of the passage of time. I continued to search for
our exit point.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Am I being blocked?” I asked. “I am not finding anything.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel scanned. Christabel scanned for a long time. I could feel
the length of time before Christabel said, “Yes, yo are being
blocked.”</p>
<p>Sliding into Mother space was a lot like sliding into Kristabel. It
felt so good and was so easy. It felt right to be there. I sighed with
contentment. Kristabel began fondling me again. I fell asleep before
she could get me off again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Eighteen</p>
<p>What Happened When We Exited Mother Space</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim had identified the star system where the exit point was located.
Salim called it Royal Cainus Star System.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why is it called that?” I inquired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim indicated indifference. “Who knows,” he said. “It’s been
inhabited for a long time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“by whom?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim again expressed indifference. “I don’t know,” he said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You know the star system, you know it has been inhabited for a long
time and yet you do not know who lives there?” I said. “I can hardly
believe that.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Let’s just say we don’t turn in the same circles,” Salim said. “Royal
Cainus is off-limits to a merchantman like me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Were you told that?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not directly,” Salim said. “It is one of the PROTECTED STAR systems.
That means merchantmen with my license cannot trade there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because–” I prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because those with better licenses can,” Salim said. I could tell the
admission shamed him.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So it is a restricted area,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That would be a good description.” Salim agreed.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When I saw the proximity of the Royal Cainus Star System, I asked
Salim to come to the runner’s area. Pru accompanied him.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Will there be a problem exiting hyperspace at the fringes of the
Royal Cainus Star System?” I inquired. I showed him the plot.</p>
<p>Salim wiggled his nose, twitched his ears and rapidly jiggled his
whiskers. He seemed quite agitated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not only do we not have the right permits,” Salim said, “to use this
exit point, we are being shadowed by an Earth warship. This is
restricted space. There could be lots of trouble.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“By whom and what sort of trouble?” I asked. “Salim, I need
information here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There are patrol ships,” Salim said. “I don’t know how many guard the
exit point. I don’t know if they will just arrest us or if we will be
shot at. I don’t know what the warship will do.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“OK,” I said.”That gives me an idea of what we are up against.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Salim and Pru left the runner’s area to prepare for the insertion into
normal space. I called Laramie Jones to the Bridge.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Laramie Jones had left me alone to run the ride through hyperspace. He
checked our progress and convinced himself I was following his route.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We are near the exit point,” I told him. “I have been advised that we
will exit into Royal Cainus Star System which is restricted. Unless we
have the necessary authorization, we are violating someone else’s
territory. The presence of the Earth war-ride and the external bombs
on our exterior are complicating factors.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not pose a question. I waited for Laramie Jones to say
something.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Broadcast this message,” Laramie Jones said. He dictated the message.
I recorded it in his own voice. The message surprised me but I said
nothing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When Laramie Jones left the Bridge, I opened the ride’s intercom.
“This is Captain Star Runner. Prepare to leave hyperspace and enter
normal space. Our presence may be challenged. Please stay in your
cabins until I give the all clear.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The war ride was hanging back. It was clearly waiting for me to exit.
I suspected it was depending on me to locate the precise coordinates
of the exit point. I could see it clearly in my mind and when I
focused on it, Christabel lined the ride up. We slid through
effortlessly. The stars reappeared. We were back in normal space.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
As soon as I confirmed our safe passage I began broadcasting Laramie
Jones’s message.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Attention, ships of the line of the People of the Golden Sun. We come
from Earth and we come to join you. This is Laramie Jones speaking.
When you retired from my world, you left instructions on how to find
you among the stars. This information has been safeguarded for
centuries by those whom you trusted amongst our people. I am the
vanguard of those who wish to live under your care and guidance. I ask
that you escort us to the proper authorities.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The war-ride came through the exit point. It is generally held that
when exiting Mother Space, the vehicle moves away from the exit point
as quickly as possible to allow any other vehicles to either exit or
insert as quickly as possible. I was accelerating at a good rate of
speed to give the war-ride room. I also wanted to be as far away from
the war-ride as possible. The message Laramie Jones gave me to
broadcast could be interpreted as an act of treason. I did not want to
have the war-ride’s weaponry directed at me. This was, after all, my
ride despite what the Earthers thought.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The patrol rides were closing fast. There were seven of them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Unidentified vessels, prepare to be boarded.” I acknowledged the
hail.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“This is Captain Star Runner,” I said over the intercom. “We have
received a request to be boarded. We will comply. Please stay in your
cabins and cooperate with the authorities of this star system.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was not sure if the authorities of this star system would be
friendly or if Laramie Jones’s request would be honoured or if we were
speaking to the successors, conquerors or enemies of the people of the
Golden Sun, but cooperation seemed the best policy. True, it had
enabled the Earth war-rides to capture my ride and imprison me in
Sanctuary City XI, but then again, I was alive and my ride was in
working condition. I hoped this operation would continue to keep both
my ride and me in good working order.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And me, too,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Any information from a sensor sweep?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They are sophisticated vehicles,” Christabel said. “they are well-
shielded from any scan I can perform.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
One vehicle approached us. I dropped shields and turned on the lights
outlining the airlock.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The war-ride began firing. We were at the extremes of its range so
although the exterior of my ride sustained damage, it was superficial.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Raise your shields,” snapped the nearest patrol vehicle.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was already raising them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The other six patrol rides began firing on the Earth war-ride. They
made short work of the Earth vehicle. It was disabled quickly and
boarded. Firing ceased.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When the shooting stopped, I lowered my shields again without being
asked. The patrol ride locked on.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Although I had asked everyone to stay in their cabins, Laramie Jones
was standing by the airlock when the first member of the boarding
party stepped onto my ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I could tell nothing about the aliens. They were obscured by a mist.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is not water vapour,” Christabel advised. “It is not smoke either.
It is more an optical illusion but I cannot penetrate it either.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is it like a cloaking device?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is related to the cloaking device,” Christabel reported. “It is
much more sophisticated and you will be happy to know it will not
interfere with your biological processes.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The shadowy figure stepped through the airlock.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Welcome aboard,’ Laramie Jones said. “We have been waiting a long
time to greet you and to serve you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is not I whom you wish to serve,” the figure responded in clear
Earther. “Arrangements will be made for you. Who else is on-board?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“My two companions, two stewards, one of which is an alien and our
pilot.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
More shadowy figures came through the airlock. Christabel was unable
to scan them. Ms. Gwendolyn Radford was terrified of them. She needed
to be sedated. Pru came quickly when Laramie Jones called her. Cousin
Trevor was belligerent. He was restrained. Salim was also terrified.
He threw himself to the floor, grovelling and avowed his unworthiness.
I would have liked to question him, but there was no opportunity.
Salim was escorted off the ride. I wondered if I would ever see him
again.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The shadowy figures fanned out, searching the cargo area, the lounge,
the cabins and finally one came into the runner’s area.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Panther-an,” it said to me. “You are a long way from home.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was stunned. Did this figure know of my race?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I replied in my own language, the language in which I had been
addressed. “I came on an errand seeking the people of the Golden Sun.
The last coordinates I had proved to be incorrect. Are you a member of
that race?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The figure did not answer me. Instead, it accessed Christabel directly
and laid in a new course deep inside the star system.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I and another will stay on-board to question the Earthers,” the
shadowy figure said. “Please make good speed to our destination.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And it left the runner’s area. All but two of the figures left my
ride. When they were back on-board their vehicle, I began the run at a
rate of speed which was slightly uncomfortable to the Earthers. I was
extremely unnerved to have my brain-shared space accessed in that way.
I felt vulnerable. So did Christabel. We worked together to operate
the ride but there was no chatter between us. AI’s are not supposed to
have feelings. Any feeling-related activities are for the sake of the
biological partner. Yet over the length of this run, I began to
question this. Christabel exhibited behaviour which struck me as more
biological. Now her concern was palpable. I tried to keep my anxiety
in check, but I had no secrets from her.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
As we penetrated the Royal Cainus Star System, there was evidence of a
dense population. The outer worlds sported domed cities. Industrial
platforms circled the gas giants. Moons had both factories and
residential areas. Many vehicles moved between the planets. My course
led me to a large asteroid about mid-way into the star system. I
assumed a parking orbit as directed. Strong tractor beams pulled my
ride into a large, multi-level parking facility and clamped my ride
into place. Walls INCAPSULATED our parking space and atmosphere was
pumped in. One of the shadowy figures—I could not tell if it was the
one who came into the runner’s area before—told me to unstrap and come
with it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the rest of my passengers?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are being escorted off your ride as well,” the shadowy figure said.
“Follow me please.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was the last one to leave the ride. Christabel closed the lock
behind me. Another shadowy figure came forward and clamped a collar
around my neck.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That will keep you linked to your AI,” it said. I wondered what else
it did. Perhaps it listened in or would electricute me if I did not
cooperate.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We moved on a sliding pavement until we reached a bounce tube. We went
down. An elevator which moved in both up and down directions as well
as sideways carried us farther away from the parking garage. We were
the only two in the compartment. The shadowy figure, the one who put
the collar on me, did not speak. I felt like its pet rather than an
equal. Collars have that effect on me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We finally stepped from the compartment into an antechamber.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘Wait here,” the shadowy figure said. It moved forward and knocked on
a closed door.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How quaint,” Christabel said. “They still knock on doors.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Whatever,” I said. “I have the feeling my fate is waiting for me on
the other side of that door.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The shadowy figure must have received a reply because it opened the
door, but did not step inside. Instead, it gestured me forward. I took
a deep breath and walked into the room.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Nineteen</p>
<p>More About the people of the Golden Sunday</p>
<p>I stepped onto a plush carpet into which my paws sunk. The walls of
the large room, a room much larger than any rooms on a space station
except for dining areas or departure and arrival lounges, was panelled
in what appeared to be wood. The ceiling was painted a metallic gold.
There were lamps lit, not the ubiquitous track lighting. The furniture
was upholstered. A large wooden table dominated the room. There was no
obvious screens or computer controls.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Welcome, Captain Star Runner,” a beautiful voice said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I looked and saw a figure which shimmered behind a golden haze. My
stomach lurched. I doubled over.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Dear, dear,” the beautiful voice said. It sounded like a melody, this
second remark in a minor key while my welcome sounded like a series of
major chords.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Analysis indicates you have a degraded genetic pattern which is
causing your discomfort. Here, is this better?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The pain ceased. The nausea retreated.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said,, feeling very much less than melodic.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am requesting a software patch for you immediately. Originally that
genetic component allowed your kind to identify cloaking technology</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
the pattern has drifted.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You seem to know a great deal about the members of the Race,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, yes,” the shimmering golden figure said. Over the millennia, ]</p>
<p>“My people and Prince Hat and his people designed and developed your
race. You are an example, a very rare example if your records are
accurate, of our most special creation.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what would that be?” I asked. This was a very unnerving
conversation. It was like being a custom-made violin or maybe one of
these pieces of furniture. I felt totally objectified, mass-produced
and of an inferior quality.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, no, no, Star,” the shimmering golden figure said. “by no means.
The fuchsia-coloured Pantherans are the cream of the crop. Not even
the gendered members of your race are as special as your kind.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Long ago I was told being a fuchsia-coloured Pantheran was special.
The members of the Institute were afraid of them. The head of the
cloning department wanted me destroyed at birth, but the archivist
persuaded it not to terminate me. There were precedents for a fuchsia-
coloured Pantheran, it argued, and when one appeared, there was a
reason for it. In fact, a fuchsia-coloured Pantheran founded the
Institute and instituted the whole practice of androgens in the first
place.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very true,” the shimmering golden figure said. “That particular
Pantheran was one of my favourites. A very clever individual. You
remind me a great deal of that one.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are that old?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Indeed, we all are,” the shimmering golden figure said. “It is both a
blessing and a burden to carry. Initiating a new member of our race is
a decision we all to decide and it takes a great deal of deliberation.
But that is a subject for another day. Today we need to discuss your
travel to this arm of the galaxy.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I believe,” I said, “you have scanned me and you know my purpose and
the events which have befallen me,” I said. I did not speak in a tone
of accusation. I simply STATED THE fact I believe was true.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” the shimmering golden figure said. “Ascertaining facts is
straight forward in a scan. Discerning the truth is more difficult.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I remained silent.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am not able to give you what you seek,” the shimmering golden
figure said. “You will need to travel farther for that. And, I am
sorry to tell you, you will not be able to travel in your ride. It was
seriously damaged in the fire fight We shielded it so that you could
travel to this centre. However, we can arrange suitable transportation
for you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And my friends?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Your friend Prudence DeLillo poses no threat to us,” the shimmering
golden figure said. “However, your companion Salim is another matter.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why is that?” I demanded. I could not see Salim as a threat.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim is not a threat,” the shimmering golden figure responded.
“Rather, he has been traumatized by a rogue element of our group. We
are concerned for his emotional and mental well-being.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And how do you propose to proceed?” I asked. There was an edge in my
voice.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Perhaps by allowing him to be with his friends,” the shimmering
golden figure said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“one of the troopers will escort you to your quarters. I request you
wait until arrangements can be made.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
With that, the door of the room opened.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner,” a shadowy figure motioned me through the door.
“If you will accompany us?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
it was not an invitation I could refuse.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My quarters were deep inside the asteroid. Christabel told me that.
She could keep track of my linear progress. It was a metal box like
millions of other boxes produced for housing workers throughout the
star systems of this galaxy.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru knocked on my door shortly after the shadowy figure of the guard
left me there.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What is going on?” Pru asked. She seemed very frightened to me. That
was odd. I never thought of Pru being frightened of anything.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We are in the territory of the People of the Golden Sun,” I said. “I
spoke to one of the shimmering golden figures.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You did?” Pru said. She was in awe.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “It was a very strange experience.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Strange how?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It can read my mind,” I said. “It asked questions but already knew my
answers and supplied answers to questions I had not yet asked.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That sounds like our stories of the People of the Golden Sun,” Pru
said. “They frighten me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can tell,” I said. “So far, there does not seem a reason to be
afraid.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But we are basically prisoners here,” Pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“My ride was damaged in the fire fight,” I said. “We cannot use it to
travel farther.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why would we want to travel further into the realm of the people of
the Golden Sun?” Pru asked. “I just want to get back to Earth.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am seeking a particular item,” I said. “The shimmering golden
figure said I could find it there. I believe transportation is being
arranged for us. Then we will see what happens next.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And Salim? Where is Salim?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim was badly shaken up by the arrival of the boarding party,” I
said. “They are trying to help him. I suspect he will be allowed to
accompany us.”</p>
<p>“And what about the others?” pru prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know,” I said. “I did not ask and the shimmering golden
figure did not tell me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And who is this shimmering golden figure?” Pru asked. “I haven’t seen
anybody like that.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It was like the shadowy figures we have already seen,” I said,
“except it shimmered in gold and spoke in a musical voice.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is what the old stories say,” Pru said. “That is why they are
called the People of the Golden Sun because of the golden shimmer.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There was a knock at the door. I suspected no one had physically
knocked but the sound of a request for acknowledgement was universal.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Come in,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The door opened and a shadowy figure appeared. Whether this was the
same one who escorted me about or a different one I could not tell.
They all seemed alike to Christabel and me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are to come with me to the lab for upgrade,” the shadowy figure
informed me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What does this mean, Star?” Pru asked. She sounded nervous.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The shimmering golden figure said there is an error in my genetic
make-up,” I said. “It said there was a patch they could apply to
correct the problem.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What problem?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am supposed to be able to sense a cloaking device,” I said.
“However, an error has crept into my design specifications and a
cloaking device makes me ill,” I said. “The shimmering golden figure
said a patch could be applied to fix the design flaw.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming with you,” Pru said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The shadowy figure made no comment. It led us through corridors, onto
one of</p>
<p>the metal elevator boxes. We entered what looked to be a waiting room
with chairs. The shadowy figure gestured for Pru to sit but gestured
me through another door.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A figure shimmered in front of me. I felt woozy. “We will have you re-
sequenced shortly,” the figure said. “Please lay down over here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It assisted me to a work table. I felt so weak that I needed to be
lifted up onto the table. Straps, similar to my acceleration web were
lowered down on top of me from the ceiling. I felt the drugs flow into
me. I lost consciousness. Idly I wondered beforehand what they would
actually do to me. The drugs must have been calming ones because I did
not feel particularly disturbed by the possibility.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can you hear me,” a voice asked. Christabel identified it as the
figure who met me in the interior room.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very good,” the voice said. “We have you all up-to-date. Your system
was very back leveled. It took longer than we anticipated but you
should notice the differences right away. Your companion has been
taken back to your quarters as we felt it was too long a time for her
to wait for you here.” We will send you back there now.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And with that I was lying on a very comfortable pallet in my quarters.
Pru gave a little scream when I appeared.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There you are, Star,” Pru said. “I did not think you were ever coming
back. It has been hours since they took you away. Are you all right?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know,” I said, trying to determine if I indeed felt all
right. I felt disoriented, but being teleported back to my quarters
was a bit unsettling. What I felt, and what I told pru, was simply
strange.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not feel the same,” I said. “I do not think anything is wrong. I
just feel something is different. I also feel very tired.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel said, “There are differences. I am scanning now. The change
log is dense. I think they have changed almost everything in your
profile. I did not think it was possible to do that.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What do you mean, my profile,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are genetically different,” Christabel said. “I am not certain if
you would be identified as you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You mean,” I sid, “I would not trigger the same identification by the
pantheran Empire authorities?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is true,” Christabel said. “You would be an unidentified
androgen. I suspect, because of you being a fuchsia-coloured
Pantheran, they would assume it was you, but a match would be
impossible.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And is that why I feel different?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No, not directly,” Christabel said. “I think you feel different
because your perceptions have been enhanced. I think you need time to
adjust to those heightened perceptions. If I am interpreting the data
correctly, you will have an even keener ability to pinpoint insertion
and exit points. You are one supercharged star runner.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are you okay?” pru asked. She was not privy to my conversation with
Christabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “I am feeling a little weak but that is because I am
getting used to my upgrade.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What happens next?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We will be travelling to a different star system,” I said. “They have
to get a ride ready. You, Salim and I will go there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the others?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I do not know about them,” I said. “Do you want to know about them?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru thought about this for a while. “Just idle curiosity,” Pru said.
“I found them to be very despicable characters.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So did I,” I said. “Apparently, they have a real misconception about
the people of the Golden Sun.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There is data,” Christabel offered. “Our database has received a
major influx of information about this arm of the galaxy. I am
scanning it now. I will provide a summary in a few hours. However, it
seems Ms. Gwendolyn Radford, Laramie Jones and Cousin Trevor has been
placed in detention. A decision is pending on what to do with them.
They intended to rendezvous with a particular sect of the people of
the golden Sun who are discredited. These are the same group who
destroyed Salim’s home world. They are still active throughout the
Royal Cluster, but they are considered enemies of the state. There is
an ongoing military action to eliminate them but it has not
succeeded.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I relayed this information to pru.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So our experience of domination was atypical of these people?” Pru
asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Apparently,” I said. “However, they are more advanced than your
planet is. I do not know how they treat native worlds. Since they have
an imperial structure, they may subjugate them. Christabel will have
more information later.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I also have an update on our travel,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Please share that,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
An image of a bronze disc-shaped vehicle came into focus in my mind.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“This is our ride,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The Terries would identify this as a flying saucer,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Exactly,” Christabel said. “I will be updated and transferred into
this vehicle in thirty of our minutes or so. There will be a
disruption in service. Your on-board monitor will be able to handle
the disruption seamlessly. It, too, has been upgraded. When I am
installed and some benchmark tests have been run, you, Pru and Salim
will board. Our course will be laid in.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Again I relayed the information to Pru.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Where are we going?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“To another star system,” I said. “I came to this area of space to
secure some goods. The shimmering golden figure said I would be able
to secure them at another location. It seemed anxious for me to do
so.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what about Salim and me?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have not received any information about you and Salim,” I said. “I
am sorry. I will inquire. I do know you are to accompany me on this
leg of my run.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Well,” Pru said. “I will feel better if we are together. I suppose
there was no future for me on Earth. I was never getting out of
Sanctuary City XI. My family disowned me. On Earth, if your family
registers such a renunciation, you cannot leave a sanctuary city. You
would have no home, no work, no way to support yourself. As a
disavowed person, no one can associate with you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is harsh,” I said, thinking of my experience of being declared
first surplus and then placed on the termination list.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is to discourage crime,” pru said. “However, my crimes were to aid
someone in need.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I see,” I said. I did not understand, but this was more information
than Pru had ever shared before. Pru said nothing more on the subject.
I doubted she ever would. Earth was now behind her.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have more information,” Christabel said. “The reason we did not
find a settled world at the coordinates Prince hat supplied is because
of a scorched world campaign carried out by the renegade People of the
Sun—the same people who overran Pru’s planet.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They destroyed whole worlds?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Many,” Christabel said. “it was a terrible war. The renegade People
of the Golden Sun have been reduced, but they still carry out raids
from time to time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was quiet. This was a terrible loss.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru seemed to be lost in her own thoughts. We waited quietly for my
new ride to be ready.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty</p>
<p>In Which We Arrive at the City of the Golden Sun</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
later there was another knock on our door. Another shadowy figure
appeared to conduct us to the new ride. There was another tramp
through what seemed endless corridors and several long rides in their
metal box elevators. Christabel had not spoken for hours. I felt her
loss keenly. The months of silence while I was incarcerated in
Sanctuary City XI CAME BACK to me. I managed to survive but it was not
easy. I shivered involuntarily. What if Christabel did not return?
There was no answering assurance from her. With a growing sense of
alarm, I followed our guide.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel’s database, largely abridged in my portable memory bank,
described these shadowy figures as guards and military personnel of
lower grades. They could cloak themselves when needed, but if their
invisibility was not essential, they were merely obscured. Their
position was fairly low level. They were an engineered class, similar
to myself. Unlike me, their personality profile was limited though
their gendered specificity was in tact. I could not discern if our
particular shadowy figure was male or female. I wondered idly what a
sexual encounter with one would be like—all that shadowiness wrapping
around me. It was, as the database indicated, a field. I wondered how
it felt on my skin. Their general lack of personality, I thought,
would no doubt interfere with the experience. Their lovemaking would
be unimaginative and the same every time. Considering this, I
discarded its potential as a provocative experience. Nor would it be a
good candidate to offer in my pornographic database should I have the
opportunity to update it. That would suggest a return to the western
spiral arm. I could only return if I procured the drugs I was sent to
purchase.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We arrived back at one of the cocoon-like hangers. In the middle of
it, suspended from the ceiling, was the bronze-coloured flying saucer
I saw previously from Christabel’s description.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Enter,” the shadowy figure said. I still had no information from the
tamber of its voice whether the shadowy figure was male or female.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I WONDERED how we would access the airlock.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A long ramp came up out of the floor. It was unadorned metal. Pru and
I walked up its steep incline and passed through the airlock into the
interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Fuchsia-coloured lights appeared.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I think,” I said, “this is for me. As there were no other lights
visible, Pru accompanied me on my tour of the ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
From the airlock we walked in a circle, finding several staterooms
before entering a large central lounge. Off of this open area was a
galley and more staterooms. I counted six altogether. A corridor led
to a bounce tube. When I bounced down I found the cargo area and the
mechanicals, including the engines, for the ride. Bouncing back up, I
crossed the lounge and located the runner’s area.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There was a large, padded platform. I approached it. As it was the
only visible feature in the area, I jumped up onto it, turned around
and settled myself comfortably, nose touching tail.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Welcome,” a neutral voice said. “Prepare for incorporation.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
solidification,” the voice said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A shimmering field encompassed me. It felt warm without me feeling as
if my temperature changed. It was soothing without interfering with my
alertness. I was amused to discover the field had a fuchsia-coloured
glow.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Hello, Star,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Christabel,” I said. “I am so happy you are here. Why did the voice
said solidification?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The process has now become solid because you are present,” Christabel
said. “For reasons that are not yet clear to me, the People of the
Golden Sun think of it from the software perspective rather than from
the perspective of the individual being interfaced.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And how are you?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am changed,” Christabel said. “I am just coming online now that you
are here. My systems are vastly upgraded and my interface with you
greatly enhanced. Can you feel the difference?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “I can. It is like we are more one being than we are
two separate entities.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” Christabel said. “I am more in your head. Your body feels more
a part of me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can access more of you more easily,” I said, feeling the flow of
data rush into my mind. It was not a confused mass of random
information, but a heightening of my awareness and perceptions.
Christabel’s external sensors, for example, felt more like extensions
to my visual sensors. Temperature and air quality within the ride felt
more like my own breathing and body temperature. I was the ride and
the ride was me. It was strange but it would also make running the
ride easier. After all, I was a star runner. I suspected that a lot of
my internal autonomic functions would translate into ride management.
The visual displays which constantly updated in both eyes were more
streamlined and more easily read and understood. Many functions I now
simply knew. I did not have to call for and assess data.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What is happening?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am getting connected with the ride,” I said. “All is well.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A figure came into view. I realized it was an external sensor array
showing me a picture.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Pru, Salim is at the foot of the ramp. Please go to the airlock and
welcome him aboard. Follow the green lights. It will lead you to the
airlock directly, not the exploratory path we made through most of
this level of the ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru went off in search of Salim. I began exploring the vast amount of
information to which I was now connected.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I learned, for example, the field around me would hold me in place
during acceleration. The pad underneath me was capable of transferring
all the nutrition and medication I required. Probes would sense when I
needed to eliminate and the proper tubing would be connected. I did
not have to think of any of this consciously. As I did a conscious
scan of my body, I realized I was currently urinating. I felt no
wetness, just the physical sensation of the liquid moving out of my
body and the ensuing relief.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“the more you expose your body to the pad,” Christabel said, “the more
surface area can be used for transfer.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I experimented with some positions, finding a very comfortable flop on
my stomach was best. It was so comfortable. It felt like being
suspended in air without feeling afraid I might fall. I was, so far as
my body knew, weightless.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Pru returned with Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Salim,” I said, “how wonderful you will join us on our run.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘Where are we going?” Salim asked. “Are those shadowy figures coming
with us?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No, just us three,” I said. “No one will hurt you, Salim. The shadowy
figures are low level guards with little or no personality. They are
engineered beings. I have assurances from the shimmering golden figure
that we will not be harmed. In fact, that is part of our manifest. We
are to carry its greetings to Thu Ku Ray, a shimmering blue figure on
the world of Solana which circles a star called Royal Blue Fire. Have
you heard of it?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No, I haven’t,” Salim said, still not fully reassured.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Look,” I said and a holo of the star chart expanded from the runner’s
area into the lounge.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I know that blue star,” Salim said. “It’s on our merchantman’s star
chart with a letter and number designation. I don’t recall the
designation specifically, butt I know it’s approximate distance and
location relative to this star system.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Royal Cainus,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Exactly,” Salim said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How long will it take us to get there?” Pru asked, expressing
interest in our run for the first time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Approximately two weeks,” I said. “This is a very fast ride and we
have a very direct route.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are we all supplied and ready to launch?” Salim asked, becoming a
merchantman again. The transformation was heartening.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was about to say, “let me check,” when I simply knew we were all
ready to go.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘Getting clearance for departure now,” I said. “The hanger is clear of
living personnel. It is de-pressurizing and the hanger doors are
opening in sixty-three seconds.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And we were running. I did not have to engage in the same way I had
done previously. I simply ran and we were moving away from the
asteroid, retracing our path through the Royal Cainus Star System to
the insertion point where we met the patrol vehicles and where the
fire fight occurred.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can handle the run easily from here,” I said. “You two could
familiarize yourselves with the galley and have something to eat. Just
speak to me and I will hear you and be able to respond. There is
plenty of food and a great man options for entertainment. Pick your
stateroom from what is available. I will stay here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The muscle massages I was receiving were excellent. The ride was
strengthening my body. I knew I would be in tiptop physical condition
by the time we reached the Royal Blue Fire Star System. With my course
laid in and all systems on automatic adjustment, I turned my attention
back to Christabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How are you feeling now?” I asked. Sufficient time had passed for an
artificial intelligence to sort itself out.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Excellent,” Christabel said. “I really like this upgrade. I am much
faster and there is much more integration and data.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel especially likes data. She can be lost in the archives for
minutes at a time which is a very long time for an AI.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I increased the G-force as much as I could without burdening my
Earther passengers. They were chatting happily, fixing a meal and
planning their evening’s entertainment. They had already picked out
their quarters. All the staterooms were well-appointed. I locked the
door of one of them which I fancied. I was able to light up a sign on
the door which said, “Captain’s Quarters.” Should I need a private
space, it would be available to me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We do not need a private space,” Christabel said. Her tone was
playful. “You can obscure the visual aspect of your fuchsia-coloured
field. No one will be able to see inside.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And why would that be necessary” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because,” Christabel said, “you will be flailing about.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘And why would that be?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because,” Christabel said, “you will be very excited by the way I am
going to touch you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And I was.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
With the new integration, her touch was both physical and emotional.
It was both exterior and in my mind. Her feminine personality came to
the forefront. She touched me with satin. I sensed the red red velvet
spandex trimmed with black lace on my own body which heightened our
fantasy. Christabel patterned her lovemaking on that of Detective
Ronnie Camberwell so it was both familiar and very arousing. I
fleetingly wondered if these fantasies would ruin a renewed
relationship with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Immediately Christabel
advised me that they would not, that Detective Ronnie Camberwell would
bring a spontaneity to the act that Christabel could not.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Besides,” Christabel said, “we can enhance her experience and
therefore yours with this added integration.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I considered this and found it to be true. Much of what we imagined
together could have a real life component. These intimate apparel
items I was virtually wearing could be manufactured for either
Detective Ronnie Camberwell or me. As I spun out this possibility, the
erotic potential heightened my desire. Christabel could now make it
seem that I had my own sex drive apart from her brain manipulation. I
always knew the fantasies were created virtually. I felt them being
implemented. Now, however, they seemed real to me. The feminine roles
we each played felt perfectly normal. The gender specificity needed to
play out these fantasies had always seemed a bit false. Now, with my
new design parameters and with Christabel’s enhanced programming and
our integration, it felt almost as possible to be gendered as I could
imagine it to be. Orgasm under these circumstances was the most
powerful and finely tuned in my experience thus far. Afterwards,
Christabel and I reviewed the sequence with an eye to archival. We
spotted the rough spots and began, with detours into performance art,
to edit and revise the program. I saw the areas that were rough.
Perhaps in time and with contact with a gendered individual, these
programs could be further enhanced.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If I could get these out into my pornographic database,” I told
Christabel, “I could charge a premium for them.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
That, too, made me very happy. My own recreation and enjoyment would
be profitable as well.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Approaching insertion,” Christabel announced. “that is according to
our previous coordinates and the information in our new insertion
point database.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Excellent,” I said. I checked on Salim and pru. They were asleep. I
did not make an announcement not wanting to disturb them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I reached out to fine tune our insertion into Mother Space. The edges
of the insertion point were crisp. Finding the optimum coordinates was
easy, easier than it had ever been before. I knew this was the
enhancement of my design parameters coming to the foreground. It was
exciting. All my nerve endings quivered.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We slid through. Everything tingled with an exact match. It was a
sexual encounter of penetration. Make a perfect insertion and receive
an orgasm. I liked this new feature very much.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It was part of the original androgen training package for star
runners,” Chrstabel said. “The shimmering golden figure thought you
should have everything your androgen forerunners had. It thought it
would amuse you to experience how they learned to make a perfect
insertion and it thought you might find it of interest to discover
what items have been deleted from the training regimen you went
through.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My training included a lot of rote memorization and uninspired drill.
I wondered how many more excellent graduates the Institute would have
if this reward was included. No matter. I would not share this package
with them.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not even for the right price?” Christabel asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“the right price,” I said, “would be more than money. It would include
restoration and an apology to start with. It would also have to have
improved working conditions for beginning star runners. I would
probably add more privisos if I thought about it for a while.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will store these stipulations as a prompt to you for more,”
Christabel said. “Who knows. Word of your enhancements could spread.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“not from me,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You have some talkative friends,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Like who?” I demanded.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Emily Dickinson for one,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I reflected on her remark for a short time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“He is a bit of a gossip,” I said. “You might think that was odd for a
former assassin.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I think it allows him to get close to his targets,” Christabel said.
“He seems inoffensive, someone at a bar or coffee shop willing to
shoot the breeze with anyone who drops by.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I turned my attention back to Mother Space. Our trajectory seemed very
clear to our exit point. I chalked it up to a better sense of Mother
Space.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The remainder of our run through mother Space was uneventful. Pru and
Salim availed themselves of the galley and the entertainment
possibilities. From time to time I joined them. Salim was recovering
though I suspected he would relapse when he next encountered one of
the shadowy figures. I hoped the personnel we met at our next space
station would not be military. With the terrabytes of data Christabel
received, we were able to determine that the asteroid where we were
taken after exiting from Mother space was a military facility. Our
next stop was not military. We would come into a civilian terminal at
the Blue Fire VII Space Station. Thu Ku Ray was scheduled to meet us
at the terminal.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I must have made a pinpoint exit from Mother Space. The climax was
quite nice. Blue Fire Star System was another busy place with all
sorts of space vehicles. There was a long line of vehicles waiting to
exit the star system and another of incoming vehicles. I joined this
line as directed by what I can only call a traffic vehicle. There
were, as it turned out, definite regions of space set aside for travel
in a particular direction much like streets and highways on a planet.
I followed the route given to me by the traffic vehicle and came into
Blue Fire VII Space Station several days later. All of my approach and
parking were handled by automated beacons. When we were finally
clamped into place, no one boarded my ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We have nothing to declare,” Christabel said. “We are empty coming
in. Since we came directly from a military base, there is no need to
inspect us. The shimmering golden figure gave its okay.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Now what?” Pru asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I need to meet with Thu Ku Ray,” I said. “He indicated you two are
free to explore the space station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I gave them each wrist-coms from our stores and showed them how to use
them. “I will be in touch when I learn more.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stepped from my ride into a busy parking area. I followed blue
lights in the flooring which led me out onto a busy concourse. It was
the usual for a commercial space station in a busy part of the sector.
We saw only an occasional shadowy figure and each one of these were at
some distance. Pru and Salim spotted a café and decided to have
something to eat. I hurried on my way, the blue lights always at my
feet. I noticed people stepped aside when they saw them. I apparently
was tagged as an individual of some importance. I noticed other
coloured lights directing other individuals. They, too, were given a
wide birth. We were all on special business. Blue, it seemed, had a
higher ranking than all other colours except Indigo AND violet. I
mostly would have the right of way. I did not see any violet lights
during my perambulation.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Finally, I opened a door into a quiet corridor of offices. The blue
lights continued to a closed door at the end. I knocked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Enter,” a HIGH, well-modulated voice called.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I opened the door and stepped inside. Like the office of the
shimmering golden figure, this room was deeply carpeted with wooden
panelling on the walls, expensive-looking pictures in gilded frames
and</p>
<p>framed certificates. I saw this affectation on the wall in Terry
offices, too. A rapidly shimmering blue figure sat behind the large
wooden desk. These shimmering figures seemed to particularly like
wooden desks.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Have a seat, Captain Star Runner,” it said. for</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was pleased that its shimmering did not bother me. I knew that,
prior to my patch, this rapid shimmering would make me very ill.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The military base at Royal Cainus says you are here to pick up a
shipment of the highest grade Piccalammy we have,” Thu Ku Ray said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is correct,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We cannot supply you the piccalammy right away,” Thu Ku Ray
explained. “It is not yet harvest time and last year’s crop was poor.
We expect a good harvest this year and there should be a premium grade
of piccalammy for sale.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was disappointed to hear this, but I seemed to have no choice but to
accept the situation.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will wait for it then,” I said. “I have come a long way to procure
it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So I understand,” Thu Ku Ray said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
There was something I needed to ask Thu Ku Ray. I did not realize,
because Prince hat did not tell me, that my procurement of the
piccalammy depended on the success and timing of the harvest. I
assumed I was picking up an item from a factory. I wondered how prince
hat’s supply endured for all this time between shipments.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh,” said Thu Ku Ray. “I see Prince hat explained nothing to you. It
might be helpful if you were briefed. I cannot spare you the time, but
there is someone who wishes to meet you. She can fill you in I am
sure.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And who would that be?” I asked. “And how is it that you can read my
mind. The shimmering golden figure could read my mind also. I thought
it was because of the collar I wore. But I am no longer wearing a
collar.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You do not know how to shield your mind,” the shimmering blue figure
said. “I think it is important that you and your crew learn this
technique. That will be arranged while you are on Blue Fire VII.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A knock came at the door. A static figure stood there.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Your blueness,” he said. “How may I serve you?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Please escort Captain Star Runner to Sam Lam Seah.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very well,” the static figure said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I left the office of Thu Ku Ray unsatisfied. Perhaps Sam Lam Seah
would allow me to ask my questions and perhaps I would receive
answers.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We walked out of the office area. I noticed indigo lights proceeded
us. Presumably the static figure knew where we were going. However, I
realized the static figure did not know. He was following the lights
just as carefully as I would have done“Do you know the way to Sam Lam
Seah?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” the static figure replied. “Sam Lam Seah does not have an office
here. Sam Lam Seah came to Blue Fire VII especially to meet you.
Normally, Sam Lam Seah stays in the palace on the planet.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Sam lam Seah,” Christabel said, “is a member of the royal family.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Now you tell me,” I said. “Why did you not mention this before?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel did not respond.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Christabel,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This never happened before.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There is a block,” Christabel said. “I have been running diagnostics.
It seems Sam Lam Seah has blocked you from obtaining information about
herself.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This made me very uneasy that someone could insert herself between me
and my AI. I felt very exposed. I had been willing to trust the People
of the Golden Sun, but now I was uncertain if this was a good idea. I
was also worried about pru and Salim.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-One</p>
<p>In Which I Meet Sam Lam Seah</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Burdened now with many questions and unresolved issues, I followed the
static figure out of the spacer terminal. These depots have a grimy,
somewhat down-at-the-heels character to them. I have come not to mind
this atmosphere. It is familiar and its familiarity breeds a sort of
comfort. It was reassuring, amidst all the unsettling aspects of this
part of my run, that spacers here were like spacers everywhere.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
But when we stepped through a certain bulkhead, we stepped into
another realm entirely. This was the up scale part of the space
station. It reminded me of the upper level of Over the Moon in the
pharaoh Star System. Here there were fancy restaurants, trendy cafés,
shops with expensive clothing, travel gear, electronics, gifts and
gourmet food stuffs. Entertainments included live performances of
music and plays. Well-dressed people abounded. I was surprised how
they deferred to me and the static figure. It was all because we
followed the indigo lights. I, too, gained some curious stares. Part
of it was my uniqueness. They had never seen a pantheran before. Most
of it though was my colour. The purple highlights in my fur suggested
the highest class of people of the Golden Sun.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not the people of the Golden Sun,” Christabel corrected. “They are
the People of the Rainbow Sky.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Understood,” I said, glad to hear Christabel’s ongoing commentary
resume.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Our path led to a wooden-trimmed door with a static figure to open it
for us. The lobby of the hotel was open to space. Our lighted path
continued to the lift. We stepped off at the fourth floor.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“This is the penthouse,” the static figure informed me. “I will leave
you here. I must return to my office in the depot.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
He retreated. I wondered how he would find his way back to his office.
Then I remembered he would follow a blue-lighted path back to Thu Ku
Ray.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I pressed a prominent button on the door frame. The door was carved
but not out of wood. The material was unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I heard a chime sound. This was a doorbell. I discovered them when I
watched video streams with my Terry friends.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The door was opened by a well-dressed figure.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner, welcome. Please come in. I am the mechanical
assistant Veck. You might refer to me as a robot or android. I am an
artificial intelligence as is your Christabel.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stepped into another lovely room.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Sam Lam Seah is waiting for you in the library,” the mechanical
assistant Veck said. “It is this way.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner to see your excellency,” the mechanical assistant
Veck said when we entered the library. Sam Lam Seah, as I expected,
was a very rapidly shimmering indigo figure.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you, Veck. You may go. I will need your assistance later.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very good, your excellency,” the mechanical assistant Veck said and
retreated backwards from the room.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you are Captain Star Runner, the Pantheran, sent to us by prince
hat from the western spiral arm,” Sam Lam Seah said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes, I am,” I said, “but I suppose you know that since my thoughts
are not shielded from you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” Sam Lam Seah said. “I apologize on behalf of the royal family
of the people of the Rainbow Sky for not requiring the military to
incorporate such knowledge in your data banks when they applied the
patch to your system. The military thought it prudent to know your
thoughts in case you were harbouring any dastardly plans against us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘Why would I?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Much time has elapsed since our last direct contact with prince hat
and the Followers of the Stars.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Followers of the Stars? Who are they?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They are what prince hat’s people call themselves,” Sam Lam Seah
said. “I know prince hat did not share this information with you. In
fact, he shared very little with you directly. His concern was that
you might fall into the wrong hands and give up the information under
duress. However, he did provide the information in a part of your
brain you are unable to access. The military discovered it. They were
able to access the outer layer so we know this much. Prince hat
encoded it so that only an indigo-level person could extract the
information. That is one of the reasons I wanted to see you. Another
was to meet a pantheran.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You know of my race?” I asked, mulling over what the shimmering
indigo figure had just told me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, yes,” Sam Lam Seah said. “Prince hat and the Followers of the
Stars always delighted in telling stories about your race.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘About the shielding,” I said, sensing Sam Lam Seah would wander away
into many tall tales and being aware Sam Lam Seah would know of my
concern and my frustration.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Of course, of course,” Sam lam Seah said. “We will get down to
business. Captain Star Runner, you are a credit to the entrepreneurial
spirit.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Sam Lam Seah clapped her hands. The mechanical assistant Veck
returned.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We must extract the data and shield Captain Star Runner’s thoughts,”
Sam Lam Seah said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am prepared,” the mechanical assistant Veck said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Proceed,” Sam Lam Seah said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Before I could respond, the mechanical assistant Veck produced what
looked to me like a gun and shot me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-Two</p>
<p>Picking Up the Pieces</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The shot was not a projectile nor was it a blaster nor a laser. It
simply was a beam which unlocked a mechanism in my brain. Once
activated, shielding and Unshielding my thoughts was easy to do.</p>
<p>Sam lam Seah said. “This is a separate orbital from the terminal where
you parked your ride. The machine assistant Veck will show you the
teleporter he how to signal your return with the pouch.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I followed the machine assistant Veck out of the library and into an
alcove in the foyer.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will set it for you,” the machine assistant Veck said. “When you
are ready to return, touch this key. It will activate your return.” He
handed me the key. I slipped it into my arm pouch.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When I stepped onto the teleportation mat, it activated and I was
already on my runner’s pad. I jumped down and went to the safe where
the diplomatic pouch had been placed by the military authorities when
they transferred all our belongings from my old ride to this one. I
needed to carry it in my paws so I used an upright stance atop the
runner’s area pad before I touch the key. Instantly I was back in Sam
Lam Seah’s penthouse suite. I brought the diplomatic pouch with me
into the library.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very good,” Sm lam Seah said. She consulted a screen in her desk.
“This is a very old protocol,” Sam Lam Seah told me. “And I place my
fingers here and here and, voilà, the pouch opens.” Even better,” Sam
lam Seah said, extracting the contents, “here is payment, some
information about you, Captain Star Runner, and a concise report on
activities within the White Bear Union.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The White Bear Union?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Did not prince hat tell you of the White Bear Union?” Sam Lam Seah
asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No, Prince hat did not,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Typical of the White Bears,” Sam lam Seah said. “They always held
things very close to the vest.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ah, he says you are trustworthy and will be his agent to the People
of the Rainbow Sky. We are to give you every courtesy and provide you
with operating expenses. He is using credit stored in our banking
system. We checked on this. There is a very tidy sum as its interest
has been a crewing for millennia.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Would not that be an enormous sum?” I asked. “Why was it not taken
over by the royal crown? This would have been done by the members of
my race I am sure.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, I am certain the crown has borrowed against it in times past,”
Sam lam Seah said. “It will take some time to sort out the details.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Here, Captain Star Runner, take this token. You can use it all over
the Blue Fire Star System. It has a good stake and if you need more,
you can let me know.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I PLACED THE token with a blue fire symbol on it in my pouch.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Since Sam lam Seah was able to open the diplomatic pouch, I decided my
business with it was done.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Will there be a return pouch?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes, definitely so,” Sam Lam Seah said. “However, it will take time
for it to be put together. I know your mission has been delayed for a
number of reasons. The people of the Rainbow Sky are very sorry you
had to to spend time incarcerated on that wretched Earther world.
Prince hat’s information about us is woefully out-of-date. We will
have an updated information packet for him. We will also update the
information his supplier gave him. We have not done direct business
with that people for some time. No hard feelings, you know. They just
have gone in a different direction. We have had our own troubles as
you know.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what about Salim and Pru?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ah, yes, the Earther woman and the Rabbit Man. Well, that is an
interesting one. Perhaps just setting the Rabbit man up in business
again would be sufficient. They seem to be quite a couple. I would not
have expected that from the earther woman. She has a very dim view of
aliens.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am an alien,” I said. “Salim is an alien. We were a team back in
Sanctuary City XI.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Which is why that pair may succeed,” Sam Lam Seah said. “I am
arranging for their welfare right now.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why are you doing all this?” I asked. “It seems quite altruistic.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There is nothing altruistic about it,” Sam lam Seah said. We want
good public relations and all three of you will give us that. We are
an old race and many of the younger races believe we are oppressive,
ungrateful, old and crotchety. And you, Captain Star Runner, know a
great deal about several of the new races in your western spiral arm.
We need to know about them because sooner or later they will come
calling on us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘All this makes my head hurt,” I said. “I am just a simple star
runner.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are a very talented star runner,” Sam lam Seah said. “You are
hardly simple, but I know a lot of this material exceeds your design
parameters. Even with your particular talents for business, this
entire run has stretched you to the breaking point. I am wondering if
you would like a vacation. We could spend it together.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why are you inviting me to a holiday?” I asked. “Let the buyer
beware,” I thought.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Because you are a very attractive individual,” Sam lam Seah said. “I
must confess, I have a reputation for being a bit on the wild side and
an affair with you would contribute to that image.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So this is about you,” I said, “not about me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Remember,” Sam Lam Seah, “I was able to look into your mind and get
an idea of what you like. I think I can provide that. Are you game?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Can I leave when I want?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Of course,” Sam Lam Seah said. “This has no strings attached. The
harvest will be ready soon and your ride will be stocked. Then you are
free to leave. I may well be entailed by the time you return. Royal
family members cannot be foot loose and fancy free as mature adults
for very long. My time is running out and I think you would be an
excellent choice for the time you have available. What do you think?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I considered. I could not find a down side to it.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If Pru and Salim are taken care of,” I said, “I do not see why not.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It will be taken care of,” Sam lam Seah said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And it was. Pru and Salim returned to my ride to retrieve their few
possessions. They were excited about Salim’s new ride. We PROMISED TO
STAY in touch though I had no idea if this would really happen. It is
a big galaxy. Even so, paths do cross from time to time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>Sam Lam Seah and I became a couple. Everyone knew it was Sam Lam
Seah’s last fling before her official betrothal ceremony took place. I
did not meet her mate-to-be. It was considered bad form. I was fine
with this. Although I suspected I would be returning to the Blue Fire
Star System in future, I did not expect to see Sam Lam Seah after this
run. She had business to perform down on the planet. Sam lam Seah was,
in the local vernacular, sewing the last of her wild oats. Infidelity
by either male or female royal member was a serious offence. In days
gone by, it was punishable by death. Nowadays it was punished by
stripping of all colour and banishment to a backwater planet.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Death would be more agreeable,” Sam Lam Seah confided.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The harvest was late that year. This gave Sam Lam Seah and I more time
for our affair.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Naturally, we were seen in public together. Sam Lam Seah dressed me in
a fine fuchsia-coloured cloak. When I moved individually about the
Blue Fire orbitals—there were seven commercial ones and three royal
ones—I was a shimmering fuchsia figure. People gave me considerable</p>
<p>deference. Fuchsia was not a colour of the rainbow, but Sam lam Seah
highlighted the purple in my colour so people identified me as a very
high-ranking official. This amused me. As Prince hat’s agent, I was
entitled to a cloak, albeit a red one.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It would clash horribly with your fur,” Sam Lam Seah said. “I think
this cloak is much more suitable. “The Office of Colour Management
accepted my application for your cloak because of your natural
colouration.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When we travelled together, Sam lam Seah and I were within her indigo
cloak. She showed me how to really close out the outside world looking
in. We were visible as a shimmering bubble, but no figures could be
discerned. This led to some outrageous sexual behaviour on both our
parts.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is it not grand?” Sam lam Seah asked. “You can put your paw up my
skirt and no one knows.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The novelty soon wore off for me but it continued for Sam lam Seah so
I played a role. As time passed, I saw her as a shallow being, more
interested in appearance than depth of character. This made much of
our time together tedious. Even the sex was fairly tedious. I will not
report it here as I have better recordings of other people. Christabel
inserted other fantasies into our lovemaking to make it more
interesting to me. She also monitored my utterances very carefully so
as not to give Sam lam Seah a hint that I imagined myself in bed with
another partner. Sometimes it was Christabel herself. Sometimes it was
Emily Dickinson or Captain Gyllian Rmeres Lujo and sometimes, most
exquisitely, it was Detective Ronnie Camberwell.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I explored my own likes and dislikes and developed a repertoire of
outfits and positions. I thought this might keep me in good stead when
I returned to my friends.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I found myself think more and more about returning to the western
spiral arm.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When there was only two days left before I could have my ride stocked
with piccalammy, the attack began.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-Three</p>
<p>The Battle for the Blue Fire Star system</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It turned out my new ride, which I still had not named, was of
military design. It was well-shielded and could be mounted with
weapons. Because it was fitted out as a passenger conveyance, it
became the natural place for the military personnel in charge of the
defence of the Blue Fire Star System.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I can run the ride,” I told them, “if you can provide the gunner and
the headings.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
They thought that would be an excellent way of managing the ride. I
bounded onto my acceleration pad and prepared to leave the hanger
where my ride was stored. The military base at Royal Cainus had
provisioned the ride well so very little was necessary in the way of
preparing the ride to be out of the ride park. Weapons were quickly
installed. A rough-looking gunner and a dandy of a navigator arrived.
Whenever not engaged in their work, they engaged in rough-and-tumble
sex right there in front of me. I recorded everything as it was quite
an education as to what is possible between two humanoid figures.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I decided to increase the g-force on our outward run toward the battle
zone. It pinned the gunner and the navigator more securely to the
floor and it made it more difficult for the brass in the lounge to
drink quite as much before staggering. I wanted to make my estimated
time of arrival (ETA) on target and enhance my reputation for being an
outstanding star runner.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It turned out our prowess as pilots was well-known in this part of
space and military personnel everywhere rued our loss when the
Trollolu Wars occupied the White Bear Union. As androgens, we could
not be replaced when those working the far reaches of this arm of the
galaxy ceased to run.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
From the data Christabel and I received, I learned my ancestors were
much less tied to their rides than I was. They did a lot of their
running by dead reckoning and verbal commands given to their
computers. I appreciated all over again my fine artificial
intelligence and the way I was now integrated with Christabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We encountered a People of the Golden sun drone halfway to our
destination. The gunner picked it off efficiently once I notified her
of its approach.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No problem,” the gunner said. “Its evasive movement routines are
predictable. On first inspection,they looked random to me but
Christabel quickly showed me the patterns. The gunner and the
navigator went on duty. I was fed a constant stream of targets and I
manoeuvred my ride as quickly as possible to comply with our ever-
changing course. We were so well-integrated I could barely register
the changes before Christabel was executing them. Status updates and
course corrections flowed through my eyes in a fast paced light
pattern. I found it best not to concentrate but to let the information
flow, inserting my expertise where necessary. There were ten and
twenty judgement calls per minute and that was why I was inserted
between the navigator and Christabel. I sensed more than knew for
certain the limitations of the ride, the angles and the acceleration
vectors.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Originally, we were to be a platform for the direction of the battle.
We continued to be that base. But the nature of the battle meant that
we were also a participant. We were hit three times but not crippled.
When it was over and the People of the Golden sun were either dead,
taken captive or retreating, I turned the ride toward its base at Blue
Fire VII, realizing we could not accelerate but must limp back to the
terminal.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A tender hailed us. Did we need assistance?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said. “We can make it under our own power. We will just be
slow.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Good deal,” the tender operator said cheerfully. “we have lots of
vehicles out here who cannot. See you back at the base then.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Another surprise was waiting for me there.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Military Honours</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When we neared the terminal on Blue Fire VII, I received a message not
to come into the depot.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There is a parade in progress,” the dispatcher said.</p>
<p>Camera droids flitted in-between the spacecraft, creating a feed for
all the people throughout the sprawling Empire of the people of the
Rainbow Sky. Commentators identified all the vehicles and the captains
who commanded them. It was a long list.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We were able to watch the parade from inside my ride. The brass held a
press conference, extolling all the brave people who gave their lives
to protect the People of the Rainbow Sky Empire from the rogue
elements which continued to plague them. I wondered that such a well-
organized military could not eliminate the threat of attack but
Christabel explained that the rogue bands were constantly receiving
new recruits, for example, Laramie Jones wished to join them and it
was because of his poor intelligence and misunderstanding of the
People of the Golden Sun that he was captured before he even made
contact with the guerilla fighters. I was surprised to hear my name in
the press conference.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We especially want to thank Captain Star Runner, a visitor from the
White Bear Union of the western spiral arm, for its willingness to
step forward and provide such excellent piloting of this craft from
which we are speaking to you. Captain Star Runner worked without
respite and with great determination and bravery to keep this vehicle
not only safe from enemy attack, but to assist many spacecraft in
combat. Captain Star Runner intercepted enemy vehicles on at least a
dozen occasions to destroy or disable enemy vehicles from the battle.
Captain Star Runner, are you able to join us from your post?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I jumped down from my acceleration pad and gestured to the navigator
and gunner to join me. Flanked by these two military individuals, I
stepped into the lounge. Off camera, I could see one of the brass nod
appreciatively that I had chosen to include the gunner and the
navigator. They, too, were introduced. I received an award.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“For outstanding bravery and conduct,” the speaker at the press
conference said, pressing a ribbon against my fur. Through some
adhesive property, it stuck to my fur long enough for the photo shoot.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When the cameras were off of us, the ribbon was removed and I returned
to my pad. Christabel said a ribbon which I could wear attached to my
arm pouch would be provided.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
At last we were able to return to our ride park. The vehicle was
clamped in place. All the people of the Rainbow Sky exited my ride. I
was thankful to have it to myself again. The cleaner bots went to work
and Christabel sent out an order for supplies to be replaced. The cost
of all this was underwritten by the military of the Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky. I was pleased even though my operating
expenses were largely being underwritten by the people’s Empire
anyway.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You have a call,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“From whom?” I inquired. Who would be calling me. I informed
Christabel previously I could not be contacted by any of the news
organizations. I strictly wanted to deal with the depot for the
delivery of the piccalammy. I was anxious to be on my way.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Sam Lam Seah wishes to speak with you,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I took the call.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Hello, Captain Star Runner,” Sam Lam Seah said. “I was wondering if
you could dine with us this evening? Dar Far Temi, my fiancé and Thu
Ku Ray will be present.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I accept,” I said. \We arranged a time and a location.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Now that I was familiar with the teleportation network throughout the
Blue Fire orbitals, I travelled quickly to Sam Lam Seah’s penthouse
suite. Fuchsia-coloured lights preceded me and with my military ribbon
affixed to my arm pouch, I received many congratulations, thanks and
wishes for success as I made my way there. The doorman bowed deeply
and opened the door for me as I approached.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When I entered the large seating area of the suite, everyone present
stood and applauded. Christabel advised me to bow.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you,” I said. “I was only doing what I was designed to do. I
was trained to be a military star runner.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And you did an admirable job,” Sam Lam Seah said, rubbing my neck
under my chin. It felt very good. I rumbled a purr with pleasure. “We
are so proud of you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Sam Lam Seah introduced me to her fiancé, one Te Lee Fam.”He is part
of our military academy,” Sam Lam Seah said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have read our histories,” Te Lee Fam said. “At one time many
Pantherans ran our space vehicles. I was wondering if we could recruit
them again.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That would be complicated,” I said. “The politics in the western
spiral arm have changed a great deal since you last had contact with
the races there. After the complete annihilation of the Trollolu, the
White Bear Union left the younger races to mature on their own. My
people expanded and became an empire. Now they run what they called
the Coalition which include the Featherote Charm and the Solar League
of Planets. The Terrans are a part of that. The Fungusian Network
remains separate. The lesser worlds have the fiction that the
Coalition treats all its members as equals but the Pantheran Empire
does as it pleaes. It controls the Institute of Genetic Design and
Implementation where I was engineered. I do not know if they would
engineer a line of star runners for you because the Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky are a potential threat to the members of my
race. I am an anomaly. I am the only androgen to make it on its own.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I wonder if we could clone you,” Te Lee Fam said. “Has that been
tried?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am not fully conversant with the history of the Institute of
Genetic Design and Implementation,” I said, “but we use gendered
members of the Race to produce the juveniles. The androgens are
genetically manipulated in utero. This prevents genetic drift and
degradation. According to the shimmering golden figure at the asteroid
military base in the Royal Cainus Star System, some degraded genetic
design has been introduced into the Institute’s genetic patterning for
star runners. I received a genetic patch and an upgrade so that your
cloaking technology did not cause me biological distress.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You actually became ill?” Te Lee Fam asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I did. The higher the ranking in your rainbow hierarchy, the more
compromised I became. I do not think I could have attended this
gathering before the patch. I would have been overcome completely.
Even the shadowy figures of your military guards affected me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh my,” Te Lee Fam said. “That is a bad bit of code.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not much fancy being cloned. It was an anathema back at the
Institute. Although I have changed many of my opinions since that
time, cloning is not one of them. The theory of cloning sounds good.
Its practice for sentient beings is less than positive. For every
benefit, this is at least one deficit to the protocol. My personality
is strong. It could be easily fractured or even become criminal in
character. Some would say it has already done so. I think of it as my
entrepreneurial spirit and my willingness to try new things. In a
military star runner, it degrades quickly to being insolent and not
obeying orders. I know. That is why I was declared surplus.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am not the best candidate,” I said to Te Lee Fam. “I did not
succeed as a military star runner. If I had, I would not be here
today.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Now that you mention it,” Te Lee Fam said, “I see what you are
saying. The fuchsia-coloured Pantherans in the archive were
exceptional individuals but that does not usually translate to good
and reliable star runners for the vehicles of the line.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Agreed,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have good news for you,” Thu Ku Ray said. “We are ready to load
your shipment of piccalammy. Despite the military operation, the crop
workers harvested the piccalammy and the factory workers prepared it
for your shipment as a rush job. It is all high quality material. Can
we load your ride now?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Certainly,” I said. “Christabel will unlock the ride if you request
it from the depot.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I made the necessary arrangements with both the depot and with
Christabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We have also been searching the archives for the quickest route back
to the western spiral arm,” Sam Lam Seah said. “Te Lee Fam says you
took a once popular route to a previous harvest centre but there is a
quicker return route from here. You will enter the territory of the
Space Traders Guild. They are a loose confederation of worlds with a
very diverse but humanoid population. We had traded with them for
millennia. Perhaps they were the people Prince Hat contacted to see if
we were still around. I have asked my cousin, Le Me Sing to contact
them to say you are coming through their space. They have agreed to
give you safe passage and to provide any assistance if needed. They
very much want to open up a conversation wit you about supplying the
western spiral arm.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have some contacts in outlying areas,” I said. “The Coalition is
pretty much a closed system, but people on the Northern and Southern
Frontiers would be interested as well as the pleasure-seekers on the
planet Hypatia in the Pharaoh Star System. And I don’t know if the
White Bear union would be interested. I have only met prince hat.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“they are an unknown,” Sam Lam Seah said. “We have a diplomatic pouch
prepared for you to take back to Prince hat. We are looking forward to
seeing you on a regular basis. I am sure there are other supplies
prince Hat and the White Bear Union will want from the Empire of the
people of the Rainbow Sky.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And with that, the business of the evening was concluded. The food was
rich and the people beautiful. I made my excuses early even though I
was the guest of honour. Christabel informed me my ride was already
fully loaded and all the stores were on-board. I said good night and
made my farewells. I took a leisurely walk through the orbital
teleportation network. It was my last opportunity to stretch my four
legs before what would still be a lengthy run back to prince hat and
the western spiral arm.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I jumped into the air lock, cycled through and stepped into my ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are you up to blasting off?” Christabel said, using a Terry term for
getting under way.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” I said. “I need a nap first. After that, I will be alert and
ready to run.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I jumped up onto the acceleration pad and flopped down. The interface
cloak folded around me. I felt warm and snug. Christabel gave me
sleeping assists and fondled me in all the right places. I slept well.
She awakened me with a very explicit fantasy. I was wide awake and
satisfied. I felt the satisfaction of good nutrition flowing into my
system.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ready?” Christabel asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Ready,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I received my departure clearances and we lifted away from the depot,
accelerating at many Gs higher than what the humanoids could tolerate.
It felt good to be running hard for my insertion point. For the first
time in a long while I felt in control of my destiny and my ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-Five</p>
<p>Arriving at the Traders’ Guild Depot</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My run through Mother Space alone was very pleasant. My new ride, as
yet unnamed, handled well. It was a larger ride than I usually
operate, but as far as Christabel and I could tell, it was quite
efficient despite its military armaments. I was surprised to discover
none of its weaponry was removed prior to my departure from the Blue
Fire Star System. As this made my ride a war vehicle, I wondered how I
would be treated when I entered Trader Guild space. My claim to be a
single operator entrepreneurial ride might be questioned. On the other
hand, Te Lee Fam and Sam lam Seah promised me the Traders’ Guild would
be expecting me. As also promised, I had the sealed diplomatic pouch
to give to prince hat upon my return to what I now knew to be the
White Bear Union.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Time, especially for those who travel in Mother Space, is very
subjective. I knew I had been away from my friends in the western
spiral arm for some time. I gave Christabel the task of calculating my
absence. In Terry standard, I had already been gone approximately two
years and ten months. With a stop over at the Traders’ Guild and a
visit to the White Bear Union, I would not arrive on the Northern
Frontier until my entire run lasted for three and a half years. That
is a long time for Terries. I wondered how my friends would find me
and how I would find them. I supposed I would just travel to Grand
Central Space Station and tell them to contact me there or at the Rock
island Line Café if it was still there. As the Rock island Line Café
was an old favourite with many spacers, I expected to find it going
strong. If nothing else, word could be left for me at the station
manager’s office or at the Rock island Line Café itself. Many spacers
did that. Ride to ride communication was not all that reliable and
often expensive. The message board at the Rock island Line Café was
free. It was not private, but many spacers read all the messages not
yet picked up for news of friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The exit into Traders’ Guild space was satisfying. I found my new
enhancements made my accuracy spot on. I wondered if I should disable
the training reward. It was a bit showy. Christabel and I decided that
while I travelled alone, my reliance on these helps was acceptable.
Our bond was increasing. It almost made the thought of a third member
unnecessary. Then I thought about my former partners and withheld a
final judgement.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You know,” Christabel said, “this feature might have military and
commercial safeguards built in.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How do you figure?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are less likely to engage sexually with another individual if
your AI is providing all you need. This would be especially true of an
androgen who has not had the wide range of personal involvement you
have experienced. They might be far less likely to be bribed or
otherwise compromised.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
This seemed reasonable to me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I must be on my guard then,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Always,” Christabel said. “We know very little of these people.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When I exited Mother Space at the designated coordinates Te Lee Fam
and Sam Lam seah provided, a customs ride awaited me. The exchanged
was formal but not unpleasant. The weaponry displayed by the ride
suggested a zero tolerance for smugglers. I was not boarded. My
papers, although not physical papers, stating my cargo and the
diplomatic pouch allowed me to proceed to the space station
unmolested.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Half Moon Bay Space Station was unremarkable in every way. Despite its
fancy name, it was a commercial terminal. Its level of grime, busy
corridors and down at the heels spacers I saw about convinced me this
was a hub of activity in this sector of space. I asked for a good
diner and was directed to the Rosetta Stone Diner. I puzzled at the
name.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The Rosetta Stone was a document on Terra,” Christabel explained,
“which allowed the translation from one language to another. I suspect
this means the café welcomes aliens.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And it did. I saw a variety of individuals I did not recognize. The
booths, well-worn, had seating for all including me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you are a pantheran,” my waitress said. “I have heard of your kind
but I have never seen one.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We are rare outside of he western spiral arm,” I told her, surprised
we had live serving staff.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We welcome the customers,” she explained. “We want everyone to feel
comfortable and make sure they can access our menus.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The controls were straight forward. She brought my bowl of milk
quickly and I perused several menus slowly and with much pleasure.
Studying the ingredients, I realized they could probably cook some of
my Terry favourites. After waving the waitress, or should I call her a
hostess, over to my table and describing my requests, she agreed with
me. Although it took a little while, I eventually had a plate of
macaroni and cheese and two chocolate chip cookies in front of me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The staff wants you to know they really like this food,” the hostess
said. “It is being added to our menus. It is cross-referenced under
pantheran, Terry and house favourites.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Excellent,” I said. “If you have Terries coming through here at any
time, they will be surprised and pleased.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
While I was finishing the last of my milk and cookies, I received a
request to see the station manager at my earliest convenience.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There is no problem,” the message said. “Do not be alarmed.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was glad to be given those assurances. It is never good news when
the station manager wants to see a commercial spacer.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We understand you have a full cargo of piccalammy bound for the White
Bear Union,” the station manager said when I arrived in its office.
“However, the Ministry of Trade wants to know if you would be
interested in setting up a regular run to the western spiral arm and
if you have any contacts there. We have been discussing this since the
Empire of the People of the Rainbow Sky officially notified us of your
desire to travel through our space. We think it would benefit both
parties if something could be arranged.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I would need a list of goods and supplies you would be interested in
trading and what you would like in return,” I said. “What sort of a
commission would I receive?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We are asking you to bring samples,” the station manager explained.
“We understand you have several unused passenger cabins. The goods we
have in mind could be stored there. We would also want you to bring
greetings into the spiral western arm so we could set up a trade
mission there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So you are not looking for me to be your exclusive courier,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not exactly,” the station manager said. “You will be well-compensated
for your efforts on our behalf. If you are successful, there will be
an additional bonus. You are welcome to apply to our guild, abiding by
its rules, of course, and to become one of our regular couriers.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What does that involve?” I asked, knowing Christabel’s legal and
financial routines would analyse the membership application and rules
carefully before I joined.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We have a code of conduct,” the station manager said, “and rates for
doing business. You can freelance, of course, so long as it does not
impact other guild members negatively.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Could I continue to transport goods through your space from the
Empire of the people of the Rainbow Sky into the western spiral arm?”
I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘There would be fees, of course, and parking fees here at Half Moon
Space Station,” the station manager said. “We have waved them as a
courtesy to the Empire because the request came from the royal family.
This is a one-time guest pass.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I understand,” I said. “Business is business.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Precisely,” the station manager said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“do you have repair facilities here?” I asked. “I assume my ride is of
Empire of the People of the Rainbow Sky manufacture.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We can repair everything except your weaponry,” the station manager
said. “The specifications for that are closely guarded. You would have
to have that repaired and supplied at the Blue Fire orbitals.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Understood,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will review your offer and get back with you before I leave Half
Moon Bay Space Station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is acceptable,” the station manager said. “We will need thirty-
two hours to get everything loaded onto your ride.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is acceptable,” I said. “I am enjoying the hospitality of this
space station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“May I recommend the Star Journey’s End Restaurant at the Stellar
Hotel for your dinner,” the station manager said. “It is a bit up
scale but spacers frequent it and enjoy it a lot.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“thank you,” I said, preparing to leave. “I will notify you as soon as
possible about business arrangements.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Although Christabel and I are perfectly capable of carrying out our
business when I am out and about on the space station, I preferred to
return to my ride to review all the materials I had been given.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“These look fair,” Christabel said. “they are very much in line with
the regulations from the League of Hypatian Pirates.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They were pirates and allowed for illegal activities,” I said. “What
about this Traders’ Guild.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“If there is a contract which can be filed publicly,” Christabel said,
“you can do anything. I have been reviewing public contracts. They
include everything from assassination to transporting stolen goods.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Is there not a police force here?” I inquired.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Only a customs force,” Christabel said. “There are peace officers to
keep the peace among the citizenry, especially planet side. I am
talking here about commercial rides and their goods and services.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“So Emily Dickinson could operate openly here as he did in ptolemy
City?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Apparently,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am starting to like this place,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They take care of their own,” Christabel said. “you would be expected
to do that, too. There are fees of course. They are a little steep but
I think the opportunities for profitable business dealings are high
here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What are the risks?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘There are pirates, of course, and because they strike hard bargains,
not all the worlds in this arm of the galaxy like Traders’ Guild rides
appearing in their star systems.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am thinking I would be dealing largely with the Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky, the White Bear Union and the Northern
Frontier, especially the Alliance of Planets,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘that is my surmise as well,” Christabel said. “perhaps the Fungusian
network may take an interest in these areas. You have not worked
directly with them but your enhancements and the upgrade the Empire
gave me will spark their interest. You may end up doing work for them
and having these papers and memberships will facilitate moving through
this space. It is a great savings in time and ride maintenance
schedules to come this way than go the way prince hat sent us.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
‘Agreed,” I said. “I will file all the papers and have the sample
goods loaded.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And will you be going to the Star Journey’s End Restaurant at the
Stellar Hotel this evening? I can make a reservation for you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That would be great,” I said. “I am really enjoying Half Moon Bay
Space Station. It is more like the space stations I am familiar with
back in the western spiral arm. Blue Fire VII always seemed a bit
uncomfortable. To me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It is very class conscious,” Christabel said. “you could not mix with
the ordinary spacers very well because of your special ranking.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will have to see about all that upon my return. I never got to the
City of the People of the Rainbow Sky either. I think I want to remedy
that in a future visit.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“As a military hero,” christabel said, “you should be able to arrange
a special tour.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I would like that,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will put it on a to do list for you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Excellent,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
When evening came to Half Moon Space Station, I set out for the
Stellar Hotel. I expected nothing out of the ordinary to occur so I
was surprised when it did.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter twenty-six</p>
<p>An Unfortunate Event on the Way to the Stellar Hotel</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stepped through the airlock of my still unnamed ride into the bay
where I was directed to park my ride on my arrival to Half Moon Bay
Space Station. The air was cold. It smelled of spacecraft and the
robots which serviced them. These were all familiar and comforting
smells. The bay was not particularly well-lighted. This is a common
feature of these large ride parks. The power to light these vast open
areas is expensive. Parking fees do not cover such amenities. I see
well in low light so it was easy for me to find the exit. I stepped
through another airlock into the hustle and bustle of a busy space
station. The lighting here was not much better but the air mix was
richer. Part of the tax a space station imposes on any ride is the
number of people who will be visiting the space station and using its
air. Freighters and passenger vehicles alike impose a tax on those
passengers who wish to visit any port of call which does not produce
its own air. As I always have business when I come to a space station,
paying these fees is a part of my operating expenses.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was thinking about naming my ride. I often chose names which had
something to do with cats: The Three Little Kittens, The Owl and the
Pussy Cat, Puss and Boots. Previous to that, I had a ride named the
Northern Star. I wondered now what sort of name suited me. I had not
liked ms. Gwendolyn Radford naming my ride the Space Rover. I did not
rove. I moved intentionally from one space terminal to another,
carrying my loads and doing business to support myself and my ride.
Originally, I simply named my vehicle Star Runner since Terries
expected me to have a name for my ride. It seemed other races had a
similar expectation.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was thinking, too, of finally getting back to the Northern Frontier
and seeing my friends again. I was wondering what sort of dig Tamara
was working on. The Pantheran military chased her away from the prince
hat Star System. She worked on two planets there, East of the Sun and
West of the Moon. I knew there was at least one lifetime’s worth of
work on either planet. I wondered if she had been able to return to
reconstruct the history of the Trollolu. It would certainly make her
an expert in her field and she very much wanted top recognition for
her work. It would help her in her academic career at the University
of the Gift Mind on Socrates as well.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I wondered how Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo’s intelligence career was
going. She possessed a higher rank than captain I knew, but I
continued to think of her as captain.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And what of Emily Dickinson? His drinking caused a serious problem on
the Landscape of Thorns. Now, what was he doing? Was he still on the
Northern Frontier or had he moved on?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And of course, I thought of Detective Ronnie Camberwell in Ptolemy
City. What was she doing and with whom?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I turned down another dark corridor. This was a short cut to the
Stellar Hotel. I was getting quite hungry and a meal at the Star
Journey’s End Restaurant was sounding very good. I read the menu
earlier and was already planning what I wanted to order.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was so preoccupied with all these thoughts and Christabel was so
focused on making all the arrangements necessary for our departure the
following day that I was not paying as strict attention to my
surroundings as I should have. Besides, the special attention I
received on Blue Fire VII and all the other orbitals in the Blue Fire
Star System had lulled me into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
A figure stepped in front of me. He held a knife in his hand.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What do we have here,” he said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Two other figures stepped from the shadows. They boxed me in. A wall
was on my right. Another man was at my left. A third figure stood
behind me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A furry alien on his way somewhere special,” the man in the front of
me said. “Well, I am guessing you have some money on you to pay for a
fancy dinner. And we don’t like interlopers. We like to keep all the
spacer jobs for ourselves. Maybe all those other outsiders will get
the hint we don’t want them around if they find your carcass here in
the morning.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
He approached with his knife.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I could see the one beside me also approach with a knife. It would be
a quiet kill. In such a darkened corridor, the security cameras would
not see much. Then again, maybe there were no surveillance cameras in
this corridor. Half Moon Bay Space Station was a fairly wide open port
of call.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I gathered myself to pounce. My tail swished. I growled deep in my
throat. I hissed menacingly.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The two men, and quite possibly the individual directly behind me
continued their approach.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I sprang, spitting in the man’s face, raking his throat with my
extended claws. Blood spurted from his severed co-ratted artery. I
felt a burning sensation on my flank. One of the others sliced me with
a knife. With another growl, I turned and sliced the throat of the
second man, killing him as well. Despite my wound, I turned completely
around and pounced on the retreating figure. This was a woman. My
teeth sunk into her neck, breaking it at the third vertebra. She was
dead as she hit the floor.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have summoned the paramedics,” Christabel told me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I waited for them to arrive. They were quick.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That’s a deep wound,” one of the women told me. “We’ll bring you to
the infirmary where we can have you stitched up. Station security will
want to talk with you. The security cameras in this area were disabled
a while back. No one got around to repairing them. This is not a usual
corridor for visitors to the space station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Armed with this information, I knew I would have a better chance of
talking my way out of any charges. Fighting aboard a space station
filled with working and out of work spacers is commonplace. Killing
spacers is not.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The doctor staffing the infirmary conferred with Christabel about
medications and materials. That done, she stitched me up and gave me
nutrients. There was no possibility of replacing the copious amounts
of blood I lost. My body would have to do that on my own.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The chief of security arrived at my bedside. I told him Christabel
could provide him with a video stream of the attack. Although a bit
grainy and dark, it reproduced the attack as I remembered it.
Satisfied, the chief of security told me there would be no charges.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They were bad people,” she said. “We could never pin anything on them
but we knew they were roughing up visitors to the station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The station manager came to visit me in the morning.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I want to assure you on behalf of the Traders’ Guild,” he said, “that
we do not consider you an undesirable alien aboard our station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The Traders’ Guild representative also came with the same message as
did the Spacers’ Guild representative. All in all my bedside was a
very busy place. At the end of two days, the doctor pronounced me
ready to return to my ride with copious noes for Christabel.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are we able to blast off?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We can,” Christabel said, “if you are willing to risk it. There is a
danger your stitches could reopen if you move around too much.
Ordinarily I would say we could blast off, but we have a long way to
run to our exit point and a long journey in Mother Space before we
reach the exit point at Prince hat’s asteroid base. I recommend
waiting for a few days. I have confirmed the piccalammy cargo will not
be impacted by the delay nor will anything already on-board for the
trade mission.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I disliked waiting, but I saw the sense of what Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The night before my scheduled departure, Christabel saw someone making
their way to my ride with a cart. At the airlock, Christabel inquired
who was it and why were they coming to my ride?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am here with a dinner from the Star Journey End Restaurant at the
Stellar Hotel,” the waiter said. “We understand this was Captain Star
Runner’s destination on the night of its attack. We wanted Captain
Star Runner to enjoy our cuisine and return to our restaurant every
time it made a stop here at half Moon Bay Space Station.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel allowed the waiter to enter. I met her in the Lounge.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“This all smells very wonderful,” I said. I prepared to pay for my
meal and tip the waiter for her trouble.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No need,” the waiter said. “This is compliments of the Hotel
Stellar.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And the dishes?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Te cart will return to the restaurant,” the waiter said. “Just press
this button when you set it outside the airlock. It is programmed to
make its way back. Normally, it would have come on its own but the
manager of the Star’s Journey End Restaurant thought you deserved the
personal touch so that is why I came.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you very much,” I said. “I will be certain to go there on my
next visit.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The meal was excellent. There was no indication what the food was. I
decided not to have Christabel analyse it. I just enjoyed it, pushed
the cart outside and sent it on its way. I would remember that I could
get food delivery if I wanted it in future. Of course I would travel
to the Stellar Hotel on very and well-lighted thoroughfares the next
time I came to Half Moon Bay Space Station.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A good night’s sleep for you before blast off,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No problem there,” I said. “I am quite full and satisfied.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We planned a sexual romp for the morning.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was delicious as usual. Christabel was quite inventive with
costumes. She picked them for herself and for me. I made a note in her
files to see about having some made for me when we got to the depot at
Grand Central. I had some particular favourites and I would enjoy
dressing up. The virtual reality was good but the reality itself would
be better. Alone on my ride, who was there to notice. And if I had a
partner on-board, she or he would also find the outfits pleasing.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We blasted off on schedule and made our way to the exit point. We were
definitely homeward bound.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-Seven</p>
<p>I Complete My Journey</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Despite the shorter return run, I spent quite a long time in Mother
Space. This gave Christabel and I a lot of time to reflect on our
three-year mission.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Who are the Traders’ Guild people?” I asked. “Do they just inhabit
space stations and rides or are they planet-based as well?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They are basically space faring people,” Christabel said. “Of course,
from time to time, individuals settle down on a planet, but they
maintain their space faring lifestyle.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are there any people on the planets?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh, yes,” Christabel said. “Most of them come from the Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky. It is such an old civilization that many of
the inhabitants descend from the first spacecraft which ventured off
world tens of millennia ago. They were never part of the Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky officially. Others come from other
civilizations including the White Bear Union. Again, it was so long
ago they have no affiliation with it. I suspect you will find pockets
of all sorts of races who launched colony vehicles which missed their
intended targets and were lost to their own peoples. Perhaps there are
even Terry colonies and Pantheran colonies out here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What members of the Fungusian network?” I asked. “Did they send out
any colony vehicles?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Not that I am aware of,” Christabel said. “Then again, the Trollolu
may have sent them somewhere and lost track of them. They would not
have been considered a threat to the White Bear Union in the war of
annihilation.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“True,” I said. “I suppose it is possible there are Trollolu out there
but I would not like to meet any of them.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“They are probably not like the Trollolu who trained your ancestors,”
Christabel said. “They might be very nice people now.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Perhaps,” I said, “but all the same, I do not think I want to
encounter them. I have a bad feeling about the Trollolu.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The way others have a bad feeling about aliens like you?” Christabel
asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was ashamed of my opinions.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Well, you do not have to find out until you actually meet a
Trollolu,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Such were our conversations as we ran. I worked on this account of my
adventures and speculated about adventures to come. I buried deep into
Christabel’s data banks and she into my mind. We were more bound
together than we ever had been before.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Coordinates indicate we are near Prince hat’s exit point,” Christabel
said. “Can you sense it?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I explored Mother Space around me. The exit point had been difficulty
to find the first time. At first, I thought it was no longer there. It
was in such poor repair. It was not a natural exit point. The
artificial ones needed a certain amount of maintenance and the White
Bear Union had done none for a long time.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You would think,” I said, “with my heightened senses I could find
it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You would think,” Christabel said, “they would repair it if they
wanted you to use it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Puzzled, I hunted for it again, recalling the note I made the last
time I visited here. The exit point should be here,” I said, “but it
is not. In fact, it is closed. I can find no trace of it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I began a search for another exit point. This seemed to be a quite
barren expanse of Mother Space.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It has been scrubbed clean of exit points,” I said. “This could be an
anomaly, but I have never encountered one before. Perhaps they have
closed this system off from outsiders.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Then how can you deliver the piccalammy?” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I will simply find the nearest exit point I can and travel in normal
space to get there.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
That is what I did. I was three star systems away, a very dismal star
system with a red giant of a star, providing little light. It was
dying, of course. It would not be gone in my lifetime, but then again
it supported no life.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We travelled slowly, even under high g-forces, for several weeks. My
ride was on auxiliary power by the time I reached prince Hat’s
asteroid base. Thankfully, it opened to my hail. We entered the large
bay and parked. The automated systems recognized me and began
attending to my ride.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“At least we will be able to leave here fully re-provisioned,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
That was a relief. Of concern to me was no word from Prince hat. Any
queries made to the automated system returned a “unable to respond to
your query” answer. Several days went by.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My ride was ready to blast off. Still no word from prince hat.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What are you going to do?” Christabel asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have been thinking about that,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am aware of that,” Christabel said, “but that is a more private
channel you have been using.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “I think there is a bit of intuition needed here.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Agreed,” christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I think I will leave the ride,” I said. “I will see about making my
way to the conference room where I met prince hat. Perhaps there is a
message there, one not left with the automated system.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What about the guard bots?” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I believe they will not interfere with me,” I said. “members of the
Race are known to them.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is true,” Christabel said. “Will I be able to monitor you?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said. “If you cannot, I will return. I do not want to be in
trouble where you cannot contact me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is a wise plan,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I left the ride, padding across a large expanse of unoccupied ride
park. The air here was of good quality. It smelled recycled but lacked
any smell of a working repair shop. Whatever smells associated with my
re-provisioning were scrubbed clean already from the air supply.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The large doors at one end of the ride park opened for me. I was in
the same long corridor I formally visited. I padded down it,
unmolested and still in touch with Christabel. I knocked at the
conference room door. There was no response. I opened it. The room was
empty. I approached the table. It was bare.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stood there, wondering what to do.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Captain Star Runner,” a disembodied voice said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I looked around. No screens lighted. There was no sense of anything
happening.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am speaking to your mind,” the voice continued. “I am a subroutine
of the base.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What can you tell me about prince hat,” I said. “I expected to meet
him here. The automated system did not know anything about Prince hat.
Why did you not contact me earlier.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“My program can only respond to occupants of this room,” the voice
said in my mind. “Unless you came here, I could not have spoken with
you.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Although this seemed odd to me, I wondered if some of the problem was
the age of the system.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are correct,” the voice said. “I can signal the automated system
to unload the piccalammy from your vehicle. Prince Hat thanks you and
regrets he cannot be here to greet you. Payment will be posted to your
account and Prince Hat will contact you at a later time. He wishes you
well on your journey. That is all.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The voice went silent. Anything I said subsequent to this
communication did not produce a response. I returned to my ride to
find the cargo of piccalammy being unloaded. This took some time.
Christabel and I waited. When all the picalammy was out of my ride, I
signalled the automated system to let us leave. The large great bay
de-pressurized and the doors retracted. We blasted off and were again
on our way.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I headed in a different direction, hoping to find a closer exit point.
I could not. In fact, I had to remove to the fifth star system from
the one where the asteroid base was located. Again, this took time and
energy. I conserved as much as possible. I plotted a direct route to
the Northern Frontier and a refuelling stop.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
In two jumps I parked at Grand Central Station.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter Twenty-eight</p>
<p>In Which I Go to the Rock Island Café</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was late when I parked my ride at Grand Central Station. I had been
here many times before. Although my account had not been active for
nearly four years, the automated station manager found my account and
reactivated it. My balance had gained a great deal of compounded
interest in my absence. In reviewing my account over the past four
years, I noticed regular payments deposited from my pornography
business. My titles were still selling well though many of my most
active users had slacked off, complaining of the lack of new titles. I
spawned a routine to begin uploading many of the fantasies Christabel
and I had tested during our homeward run through Mother Space. As the
new titles hit the catalogue, messages went out to my registered
users. I had to buy more capacity to accommodate the instant demand.
Credits flowed into my account. Christabel, before posting our prices,
made a check of our competitors and increased our pricing structure to
reflect the current market norms. My new fantasies, especially those
with the aliens I met in my travels, were given a very high price
point. As the high ratings for the fantasies were posted and shared,
the demand continued. I was quite pleased and looked forward to more
profit in the future. Several of my fantasies with Christabel went
viral across the Pantheran Empire. There was even demand from the
Southern Frontier and the Pharaoh Star system.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Prince hat’s deposit was made almost immediately after the piccalammy
was unloaded from my ride at the asteroid base. No direct word from
him was waiting for me. I wondered if I would ever hear from him
again. Perhaps the payment had been left in an automated system, too.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I sent out messages to my friends. As I suspected, Tamara was off on
another dig but not in the Prince hat system. She had found another
Trollolu dig way out at the fringes of the Southern Frontier. She said
it was so far out she doubted the Coalition would concern themselves
with her. Besides, the Coalition was busy in the far east dealing with
some rebellious planets. The fighting there was intense and Coalition
forces were making poor headway against the rebels. It was causing
quite a brouhaha in the assembly. Delegates from all the races who
attended the meetings wondered allowed in the Coalition forces were up
to the task of putting down the insurrections. There was talk of
dissolving the Coalition so that all the races could go their own way.
I wondered how long the pantheran Empire would put up with that. If
necessary, I knew the Pantheran military could destroy the stars of
the rebellious planets. That would be a significant show of force the
Empire would doubtlessly try to avoid at all cost. That capability was
unknown to Coalition members. The Pantheran military prided itself on
using on the amount of force it needed to quell any disturbance and
especially wanted to not show its hand as the superior force it was.
It was all politics and I did not have the mind for it. The benefit to
me was I doubted the military had time to pay much attention to my
return. Besides, I was old news and had not caused any trouble for
them in years.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
At last I received a response from Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo. We
arranged a time to meet at the Rock Island Line Café My messages to
Emily Dickinson went unanswered though they were delivered. I did not
have the courage as yet to contact Detective Ronnie Camberwell. I
decided to wait to see if Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo and I could
start up our relationship again. Although we had previously agreed not
to be monogamous, we kept a torch burning for each other. I had been
away a long time. I wondered if anything had changed.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I told myself I was all right with anything, any turn our relationship
would take, but I was quite nervous as I approached the Rock island
Line Café Four years can be a long time to Terries. I was surprised
how well I looked catching my reflection in the glass of the
restaurant. My fur was still a sleek fuchsia colour and I still walked
easily. With my enhanced biological profile and Christabel’s care, I
was far exceeding the usual life span of a star runner. Then again,
the pantheran military did not spare care for its star runners.
Perhaps I was quite normal. I had no idea what the life span of a
gendered member of my race was.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
How would Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo look? I had no idea how old she
was. I had never asked. Because she was part of the Ministry of
Defence for the Alliance of Planets, her records were not in public
data banks.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I stepped through the door and looked around.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Well, hello, stranger,” the waitress said. “It’s been a long time
since this pussy-cat graced this establishment.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have been away,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Off on one of your adventures?” the waitress asked. “When will we
read about this one.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I am working on it now,” I said. “it is quite long and involved.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I should think it would be,” the waitress said. “How long has it been
since you were here last?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“About four years,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Has it really been that long?” she said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes, I am afraid so,” I said. “Is Captain gyllian romeres Lujo here?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“The Colonel is waiting for you at your favourite booth,” the waitress
said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Colonel?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“A full bird colonel,” the waitress said. “For my money, they should
make her a general.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I walked to the booth in the back, looking for Captain, I mean,
Colonel Gyllian romeres Lujo’s dark hair.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was still dark, though Christabel whispered to me that she thought
it was died. I told Christabel to be quiet.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“There you are, Star,” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. “It has
certainly been a long time. We were all worried about you. But you are
looking grate.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Thank you,” I said. “So are you. The waitress says you are a colonel
now. I guess I should stop calling you captain.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>“Oh, Star,” Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo said with a smile, “I would
not know you were talking to me if you did not call me Captain gyllian
Romeres Lujo. It is quite all right. You know, when I first met you, I
was a Lieutenant. You called me Captain because I ran my own ship.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Oh,” I said, “that is a surprise to me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“It gave me more cred out on the frontier,” Captain Gyllian romeres
Lujo said. “Now being a Colonel gives me more clout.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
We laughed together.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
The waitress brought our order: a salad for Captain Gyllian Romeres
Lujo and a piece of their famous chocolate cream pie for me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Cook says for you to come back tomorrow, Captain Star Runner, and he
will make you maaroni and cheese and chocolate chip cookies,” the
waitress said.</p>
<p>macaroni</p>
<p>“I will be back for that,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Tell me about your run,” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said so I did.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And what about you?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Well, as usual, I cannot tell you about what I am doing,” Captain
Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. “But I can tell you that I am in a
monogamous relationship with someone.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
My heart sank. Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo is my friend and she has
known me for a long time but she cannot read my expressions very well.
I decided to be very upbeat about this news. She seemed very happy.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is wonderful,” I said. Tamara always told me this sort of a lie
was all right to tell. I would hurt Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo’s
feelings otherwise. “Is it anybody I know?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“No,” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said. “It is someone connected with
the University of the Gifted Mind. Tamara introduced us. Lester works
in the administration of the University so he is on Socrates most of
the time. I can get to visit him several times a month. We are quite
serious.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I did not know what to say to this. I decided to ask a question.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Are you happy?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Very happy,” Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo said. “I am glad you are
not mad at me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why would I be angry?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Well, we had made an agreement,” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.
“I broke it by committing myself to Lester.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I thought about this. What would Tamara tell me to say if she was
here?</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was gone for a very long time,” I said. “You must have been
lonely.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I was,” Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo said. “We were afraid something
bad had happened to you. We wondered if you would ever return.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I came back as soon as I could,” I said. “It was a very difficult
time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“But it sounds like you have made some business opportunities for
yourself,” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“We will see,” I said. “I do not know about prince hat at this point.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“perhaps that is a closed chapter in your life,” Captain Gyllian
Romeres Lujo said. “I would be happy if it was. There are so many
unanswered questions there and now that the exit point is blocked, it
sounds like they do not want any more visitors.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is what I think, too,” I said. “Time will tell. At least I
received compensation for my time.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“did you receive more than you expected?” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo
asked. “I know that is a prying question.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Let me just say the compensation was generous,” I said. “I also have
a new, fancy ride. It does not yet have a name.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo smiled. “I am sure you will think of
one.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have two questions before you go,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What are they?” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“First, have you heard from Emily Dickinson? I sent him a message but
he has not responded to me.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“He went to the Southern Frontier some time ago,” Captain Gyllian
Romeres Lujo said. “No one has heard from him since he arrived at
Three Ravens. Everhart will show up. Bad pennies always do.” And she
smiled to tell me she was fond of Emily Dickinson.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And,” I said, hesitating.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And?” Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo prompted.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And do you think I should contact Detective Ronnie Camberwell?” I
asked all in a rush.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are still carrying a torch for her, aren’t you?” Captain Gyllian
Romeres Lujo said. It was not a question I needed to answer.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“What do you think?” I asked. “I am no good at understanding Terry
things. I would ask Tamara but she is off on a dig and such questions
are difficult when she is so far away.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Why don’t you send her a friendly note,” Captain Gyllian romeres Lujo
said. “Tell her you have arrived back on the Northern Frontier safe
and sound and you have been thinking about her and you wonder how she
is. If she wants to be in touch with you and even see you again, she
will say so. After all, she knows you pretty well and knows you have
trouble with Terry things as you so cutely put it.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“That is a good idea,” I said. “I will do that.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And now, my furry friend, I must be on my way.” Captain Gyllian
Romeres Lujo stood up. She scratched me behind my ears. “You take care
of yourself, Captain Star Runner, and stay in touch with me. We are
still friends, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said, though I wondered if I would ever see her again. Her
relationship with this Lester Terry sounded very serious indeed. I
was, after all, just an androgen alien and he was a man. I wondered
idly if Captain Gyllian Romeres Lujo had ever told or would ever tell
Lester about her and me.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I doubt it,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I doubt it, too,” I said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
It was time for me to leave the Rock Island Line Café, too. I strolled
through the space station, stopping at familiar shops. Christabel
directed me to a shop where I could order some of the outfits we
designed together. This shop catered to the sexual trade and was
staffed entirely by robots. No comment was made about my designs or
the choice of fabrics, leather and spandex, satin and velvet, lace and
silk and crisp cotton and linen. My order would be completed by the
next day. All of the fabrics were in stock in the right colours. I
wondered if I would have a chance to use any of them with Detective
Ronnie Camberwell.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I returned to my ride and composed the message as Captain Gyllian
Romeres Lujo suggested. I sent it priority light mail. I also paid for
a response should Detective Ronnie Camberwell choose to make one.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Then I went to sleep. It had been an eventful day.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
In the morning, I read Detective Ronnie Camberwell’s response.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Chapter twenty-Nine</p>
<p>In Which Detective Ronnie Camberwell Responds to My Light Message</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel made slow and satisfying love to me in the morning. My
system was awash with relaxing and satisfying chemicals. I felt well-
satitated with food and sex. It was only then that Christabel told me
that Detective Ronnie Camberwell replied to my message.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“I have not opened the file,” Christabel said. “I thought you should
do that.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I understood what Christabel was doing. She anticipated a negative
response. It was a small file and the answer was sent almost
immediately upon receipt of my light message. Surely, Christabel
reasoned, this was a flat refusal to have anything to do with me now
or in the future.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was not so certain, but I was very nervous about opening the file.
It read in full:</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Dearest Star, how wonderful to hear you are safe and back on the
Northern Frontier. I can meet you at the Intergalactic Diner any time
you come to the Pharaoh Star System. I can’t wait to see you. I have
missed you so much. Love, Ronnie</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I was stunned.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“How fast can we get there?” I asked.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Christabel did the calculations.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I checked on my suppliers. Everything would be ready by noon. I made
my reservation for noon at the Rock Island Line Cafe. No reason to
miss a meal of macaroni and cheese and chocolate chip cookies.
Detective Ronnie Camberwell would understand that and laugh.
Christabel updated our estimated time of arrival in the Pharaoh Star
System and we set out for the Alexandra Space Station as soon as I
returned from my excellent lunch.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
Time passed slowly on this run. I boosted out of Grand Central at
maximum G-force and did the same when I insered into the Pharaoh Star
Sysem. I came, as one depot worker put it, screeching into Over the
Moon. Christabel was hardly locked down when I bounded out of the
airlock and literally ran for the departure lounge to catch a shuttle
to Ptolemy City.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You must be in a hurry,” the flight attendant said as I strapped in.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Yes,” I said, “I am.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
But I did not say why.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
I grabbed a caravan and stepped out near the Intergalactic Diner. I
ran down the street and through the door.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“Star,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell cried, jumping down from her stool
at the counter. She ran across the floor to me and through her arms
around my neck. The whole diner applauded.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“You are the best thing on the menu today,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
“And so are you,” I said. “I have missed you so much.”</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
And my story ends here, dear reader, because, as I have said before,
Detective Ronnie Camberwell prefers that our private time stays
private.</p>
<p>&gt; &lt; p&gt;
They called them Sanctuary cities on that planet called Earth in that
other arm of the galaxy. Being with Detective Ronnie Camberwell is my
own personal sanctuary and that is all I am going to say about this.</p>
