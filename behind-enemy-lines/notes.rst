I was going to spend November editing several projects and call that
my `Nanowrimo`_ experience for 2014. I whimped out doing such a
project in July for `Camp Nanowrimo`_. However, the bug is back for
writing. Additionally, Mike is getting excited about writing so it
will be fun to write alongside him.

This will be an ongoing post with notes for my novel.


Where Are We?
-------------

Ronnie and Star have gone to the adjacent arm of the galaxy (I suppose
they could have stayed in the same arm but that's not how I wrote the
other novels so I'll stick with this.) as Star is working out of Half Moon Bay Space Station.

Ronnie is working as a detective for Jack Whicher. She is not a
citizen of Half Moon Bay. She can't be. Only the original Trade
Guilders can be. However, she carries the necessary papers (and pays
the necessary fees) to be an official guest. As such, she can operate
on the station. Like Star, she is a private operator.

As such, she went off station to Planet X. (a story I haven't written
yet but I've started a number of times.) Star took her there, expecting
this to be a holiday of sorts. It didn't work out that way.

Star, always wanting to make a profit, agreed to transport Heracles
Fromm, one of the archaeology students ffrom Planet X, to Space
Transfer X (Ten) in the Lystra Empire. Space Transfer X is in a war
zone.

Working on the Plot
-------------------

Ronnie was appalled when she found out.

Once there, Ronnie and Star could not receive clearance to leave.

Lystra was an old regime. It was hierarchical, broke, falling apart, and
yet it saw itself as grand though over centuries most of its far-flung
holdings were taken away.

From Ronnie's perspective, they were being held behind enemy lines.
She was afraid.

From Star's perspective, they were not. This was just another delay
and Star fretted about its profits.

 
She became more afraid when the authorities came calling, asking her to
solve a mystery.Heracles Fromm had recommended Ronnie. He is from an
old family and his recommendation carried weight.

Ronnie thinks the Fromm boy is misguided and as the novel progresses,
she wonders if he can be trusted.

.. admonition:: Twist

          Write more about why. What is Fromm's motivation? What is
	  his assessment of Ronnie's ability to solve the mystery? Or
	  is he willing to sacrifice Ronnie 's inability to solve the
	  mystery quickly to divert attention elsewhere? 

Ronnie made Star promise it would not leave the transfer point without her.

.. admonition:: Twist
 
            Star breaks this promise in pursuit of profit and because
	    Star thinks leaving the space transfer point will promote
	    the greater good. Star's interpretation of how its actions
	    will contribute to the greater good is ill-conceived as
	    usual. 

War Zone
--------

Time to look up who some of the players are in this area of space.

Lystra
  An aging empire at the end of its run. Its neighbors have captured
  many of its outlying star systems and are moving towards its home
  star.

Empire of the people of the Rainbow Sky


Space Traders Guil



White Bear Union
  Ronnie comes to learn of their participation. At the opening of the
  novel, all that is known of this ancient people that Prince hat was
  Star's contact in *Sanctuary*. 

Conflicts
---------

1. Ronnie and Star: Going into a war zone.
2. Ronnie and Star: Entering Lystran space.
3. The war itself.
4. Heracles Fromm's breezy manner towards Ronnie's growing fear for
   her safety from the perpetrators of the mystery.
