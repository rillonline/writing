I was going to spend November editing several projects and call that
my `Nanowrimo`_ experience for 2014. I whimped out doing such a
project in July for `Camp Nanowrimo`_. However, the bug is back for
writing. Additionally, Mike is getting excited about writing so it
will be fun to write alongside him.

This will be an ongoing post with notes for my novel.

I was going to develop Planet X as a separate project. I have started
it several times and only gotten as far as a page or two. I can
imagine the hotel on top of the mountain and the funicular going up to
it. There is a dark and stormy night as Star tells us in one of my
tries at an opening. i can also hear a scream which is followed by an
unexplained death. 

Ronnie has been sent to guard the dead person and another student
named heracles Frome. Because she was not able to save  Suri Iglesia,
she sets about to solve the murder while protecting heracles. Ronnie
is unsuccessful in solving the murder. She believes powerful forces
are blocking her investigation. 

Suri and Heracles were brought to Planet X to study some ancient
structures in the Chalk Valley. These structures are now heavily
encrusted with chalk. The accepted age of these structures is eleven
thousand years old which fits with the known history of the planet.
However, Heracles and Suri believe the structures are much older. This
means the civilization know to exist on Planet X at that time did not
build these structures although they made Good use of them. 

Ronnie is convinced Suri was killed because she sent out a message
claiming that the Empire of the Rainbow Sky may have built these
structures in one of their expansion periods.

Why the Empire of the Rainbow Sky would want to cover up this
information is unknown.


Where Are We?
-------------

Ronnie and Star have gone to the adjacent arm of the galaxy (I suppose
they could have stayed in the same arm but that's not how I wrote the
other novels so I'll stick with this.) as Star is working out of Half Moon Bay Space Station.

Ronnie is working as a detective for Jack Whicher. She is not a
citizen of Half Moon Bay. She can't be. Only the original Trade
Guilders can be. However, she carries the necessary papers (and pays
the necessary fees) to be an official guest. As such, she can operate
on the station. Like Star, she is a private operator.

As such, she went off station to Planet X. (a story I haven't written
yet but I've started a number of times.) Star took her there, expecting
this to be a holiday of sorts. It didn't work out that way.

Star, always wanting to make a profit, agreed to transport Heracles
Frome, one of the archaeology students from Planet X, to Space
Transfer 724  in the Lystra Empire. Space Transfer 724 is in a war
zone.

Working on the Plot
-------------------

Ronnie was appalled when she found out.

Once there, Ronnie and Star could not receive clearance to leave.

Lystra was an old regime. It was hierarchical, broke, falling apart, and
yet it saw itself as grand though over centuries most of its far-flung
holdings were taken away.

From Ronnie's perspective, they were being held behind enemy lines.
She was afraid.

From Star's perspective, they were not. This was just another delay
and Star fretted about its profits.

 
She became more afraid when the authorities came calling, asking her to
solve a mystery.Heracles Frome had recommended Ronnie. He is from an
old family and his recommendation carried weight.

Ronnie thinks the Frome boy is misguided and as the novel progresses,
she wonders if he can be trusted.

.. admonition:: Twist

          Write more about why. What is Frome's motivation? What is
	  his assessment of Ronnie's ability to solve the mystery? Or
	  is he willing to sacrifice Ronnie 's inability to solve the
	  mystery quickly to divert attention elsewhere? 

Ronnie made Star promise it would not leave the transfer point without her.

.. admonition:: Twist
 
            Star breaks this promise in pursuit of profit and to
	    answer a request made by Sam Lam Seah, a royal family
	    member  from the Empire of
	    the People of the Rainbow Sky, a former lover. 
	    Star thinks leaving the space transfer point will promote
	    the greater good. Star's interpretation of how its actions
	    will contribute to the greater good is ill-conceived as
	    usual. 

War Zone
--------

Lystra
  An aging empire at the end of its run. Its neighbors have captured
  many of its outlying star systems and are moving towards its home
  star. Chief among these are the People of the Golden Sun and the
  Empire of the People of the Rainbow Sky.

Empire of the people of the Rainbow Sky
  An old and very advanced race that has predominated in its space for millennia. 

People of the Golden Sun
  A renegade and often changing group in revolt against the Empire of
  the People of the Rainbow Sky

Space Traders Guild
  A loose confederation of humanoid peoples focused on trade. Their
  interest is not territory but free access to space stations,
  transfer points and spaceports. Star's friends Salim and Pru are now
  part of this group.
Q
White Bear Union
  Prince Hat's people and perhaps others. Prince hat's people may call
  themselves Followers of the Stars. Until Star made contact with
  Prince hat in *Landscape of Thorns*, there had not been contact with
  anyone in the White Bear Union for centuries. Upon its return in *Sanctuary*, Star
  did not encounter prince hat.

  Ronnie comes to learn of their participation during her investigations.

Mysteries
-----------

1. Who killed Suri Iglesia?
2. If the Empire of the Rainbow Sky orchestrated Suri Iglesia's
   murder, why?
3. If Heracles and Suri are right about the age of the structures, why don't they want anyone to know they built the
   structures on Planet X? What are they hiding?

---------
Conflicts
---------

1. Ronnie and Star: Going into a war zone.
2. Ronnie and Star: Entering Lystran space.
3. The war itself.
4. Heracles Frome's breezy manner towards Ronnie's growing fear for
   her safety from the perpetrators of the mystery.
