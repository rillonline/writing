<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Prologue</a><a class="headerlink" href="#prologue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I read somewhere that novels should not have prologues. This one,
however, needs one.</p>
<p>As in my last novel, <em>Marathon, National Novel Writing Month 2013</em>, this
story is told from several perspectives. I am  the primary
narrator, but Captain Star Runner also narrates events from her
perspective. At times we speak in our own voice. At other times, I
have taken the liberty of narrating in the third person to introduce
information and perspectives that I did not have at the time but which
will help you, the reader, make sense of this convoluted tale.</p>
<p>As background, (I cannot assume you know our backgrounds), Captain
Star Runner and I have moved to another arm of the galaxy. We call our
own arm the western galactic arm or the spiral arm. The people here
call their arm the primary arm.</p>
<p>I am a human being from the Pharaoh Star System. My background is
police enforcement in Ptolemy City. Captain Star Runner is a
fuchsia-colored genderless Pantheran. I call Star <em>her</em>. Others call
Star <em>him</em>. Star is comfortable with <em>it</em>.  I am not.</p>
<p>Once we were a registered couple. We broke up. We’re together again
but we have not made it legally binding. This arrangement is working
well enough. Captain Star Runner makes her living as a courier. She is
genetically engineered by the Pantheran Institute of Genetic Design to
live in conjunction with an artificial intelligence to pilot a starship
and to have the AI manage her biological functions. The AI is called
Christabel.</p>
<p>I do not like living aboard a spaceship and traveling about. Star
finds this odd since Ptolemy City is a domed area of Hypoxia which has
an extremely violent and toxic atmosphere. I think it is the presence
of a sky. The dome over Ptolemy City is clear and I can always look up
to see scudding yellow and red clouds with bursts of other colors
swirling overhead. The ceiling on a spaceship and the solid walls
gives me a sense of being hemmed in. Star Runner finds this feeling
comforting and reassuring. I find it claustrophobic.</p>
<p>The space station called Half Moon Bay is a bit more open. I have a
cubbyhole there and make the space station my home. I come aboard
Captain Star Runner’s ride whenever she is in port. I also frequent
the hydroponic gardens and other open areas on the space station.</p>
<p>Half Moon Bay Space Station is run by the Space Traders Guild. This is
a loose confederation of humanoid peoples. Among these are the Rabbit
People. Captain Star Runner made friends with a Rabbit Man named Salim
in her adventure <em>Sanctuary, National Novel Writing Month 2011</em>. I
operate as an investigator there with Jack Whitier.</p>
<p>I tell you all this to get you ready for this current adventure.</p>

<h2>Some Notes From the Author<a class="headerlink" href="#some-notes-from-the-author" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I would write the account of this adventure with lovely
markers as to place, time and day but I have no idea what that would
look like. I can probably get the place right. Let’s try that. This
is, after all, a first draft.</p>
</div>

<h2>Space Transfer Point 724, Local Time: Evening<a class="headerlink" href="#space-transfer-point-724-local-time-evening" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Heracles pointed the  evaporator gun   right at my collar bone. I was
in no doubt he would shoot. I was definitely scared. In fact, I was
very scared. And then I thought to myself: Why be scared. You are
going to die. Your body will not be found. Someone might test for
particles, might notice an odor, but given the fact that we were in a
seedy part of the space transfer point, it was unlikely anyone would
investigate. By the time Captain Star Runner returned (if Captain Star
Runner ever returned), there would be no way to determine I was killed
here. Heracles would have plenty of opportunity to sanitize the area.</p>
<p>And then I grew calm. Given the imminent reality of my death and the
means of my death, I could put my focus elsewhere. I could talk to
Heracles and see if I could talk him out of shooting me. That may seem
a strange thing to do in the final seconds of your life, but I made a
conscious decision not to spend my last seconds being afraid. I don’t
like feeling afraid. It makes me feel weak, ineffectual and, frankly,
quite silly and juvenile.</p>
<p>So I straightened up and took a step  forward. Surprisingly, Heracles
still didn’t shoot. I was waiting for the “Sorry I have to do this to
you, Ronnie” speech but it didn’t come.</p>
<p>I said, “Heracles, you can’t go on shooting people. I works for a
while. You can shoot yourself out of one situation and then another
and another, but at some point, this strategy won’t work. Someone will
get to you before you get to them. Or someone will arrest you before
you can get them alone to evaporate them. Or worse, someone will get a
hold of you and do things to you which are very disagreeable or
painful or both. You are dealing with some very nasty forces and they
have no interest in you at all. You are nothing more than a pawn in
their galactic politics. They’ll get tired of you and then poof!
You’ll be gone and they will carry on with no more thoughts about
you.”</p>
<p>It was, upon reflection, a very trite speech. The difficulty of
triteness is that it is often still true. The entities involved were
massive and Heracles was only a member of a minor noble family in a
dying empire. His death was of no importance to the powerful members
of Lysistrata and certainly of no importance to the other imperial
players.</p>
<p>I knew with this speech I was also indicating how unimportant I was,
but I hoped Heracles wouldn’t notice that. I was important to him
because I knew what had already happened and how he was involved. I
also was getting a handle on the beginner picture. I was not at all
certain Heracles knew what that picture was.</p>
<p>And that is what did it. He lowered the gun.</p>

the reader with the evaporator gun pointing at Ronnie, but
I will leave it for now.</p>

<p>“Let me understand you.” Captain Star Runner sat up on her pedestal in
the control center of her ride. “You want me to take you to Planet X?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” I said.</p>
<p>“for what purpose?”</p>
<p>“I need to guard some people I will meet there..”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“The less I say about this case the better,” I said.</p>
<p>Star twitched her tail. She was getting agitated.</p>
<p>“I don’t like secrets,” she said. “I share everything with you.”</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>Star twitched her tail again.</p>
<p>I had not meant to sigh out loud.</p>
<p>“Privacy is not the same as keeping secret,” I said.</p>
<p>How many times had I gone over this same ground with Star Runner?
Since her interface with the AI Christabel was a two-way exchange of
data, Star Runner could not understand withholding information from an
intimate. She expected our relationship to function on the same level
of exchange. She had purchased an information link which was
integrated into my nervous system. With this I could access the space
station wide network. I could also interface with Christabel. In this
way Star Runner expected me to interface with her. That I did not
fully trust Christabel with all my thoughts dumbfounded Star Runner.
She could not imagine nor had she ever lived without an AI sharing her
thought space. I found the whole concept repugnant. I want my own
self hood. I do not want to share my innermost thoughts and feelings
with two alien minds, the Fungus artificial intelligence Christabel
and the Pantheran engineered Star Runner. I do not want to share that
level of intimacy with any other human either. It is not a racial
preference on my part.</p>
<p>“This case has a lot of cloak and dagger about it,” I said, regretting
my words as soon as I spoke them. Cloak and dagger would spark Star
Runner’s interest for sure.</p>
<p>“Really?” Star’s ears swiveled this way and that on top of her head as if she could hear
something I was not saying.</p>
<p>“Two archaeological students need guarding. I’m going to Planet X.. If
you go along, I can use the cover of going on holiday.”</p>
<p>“To Planet x?” Star Runner was incredulous.</p>
<p>“There’s a hotel on top of a mountain from what I understand. There’s
a fanciful that runs up the side of the mountain to get there.”</p>
<p>“The hotel is barely functioning.”</p>
<p>Christabel inserted herself into
our conversation.I was annoyed. She was always there, always
listening, always making a record of what we said and what we did.
This was Star Runner’s memory bank.</p>
<p>Christabel said, “It would be a tough cover to maintain.”</p>
<p>“It is all I have.” I felt defeated. Planet X was where the students
had made some sort of discovery. I was hazy on the details. They
thought their discovery would upset certain powerful entities and one
of them had asked for protection. The request came to me. I needed
work so I had made the contract. Now it looked like Star Runner would
not help me and how would I get to Planet X.</p>
<p>“a vacation with you could be fun,” Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“Vacation is a cover story,” I explained as patiently as I could. “It
doesn’t mean it will actually be a vacation.”</p>
<p>“But people will have to think we are on vacation,” Star Runner
pointed out. “That means we will have a nice room and go to meals
together and do some fun things.”</p>
<p>I was beginning to think Star was warming up to the idea. As for me,
I was thinking my initial idea was a bad one. Everyone in the primary
arm knew about genderless Pantherans. They did not go on vacations.</p>

<h2>En Route to Planet X<a class="headerlink" href="#en-route-to-planet-x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Planet X lies in a region of space which has no definite affiliation.
Any star map will show that Planet X could be in the Space Traders
Guild. The star systems that align with Space Trader sentiments are in
close proximity to one another. Traditionally, as far as the records I
can find show, Planet X has never been associated with the Space
Traders Guild.</p>
<p>Another possibility for association is the Empire of the Rain Sky. At
different times in its long history Planet X’s star system would have
been well inside its territorial borders. However, I could not find
any references to it there either.</p>
<p>Lystran records do speak of Planet X, but not as part of the Lystran
Empire. The Lystran Empire did not extend as far as Planet X’s star
system at any time in its documented history.</p>
<p>As for Planet X itself, its history is poorly documented. I find this
surprising as record keeping is something the Empire of the Rainbow
Sky and Lystran are quite diligent about. Empires usually are. Empires
spawn huge bureaucracies which delight in keeping track of everything.
Its job security for a lot of people. Lystra and the Empire of the
Rainbow Sky are no different from the Pantherans, the Featherote
Charm, the Fungusian Network or the Solar League. They keep records.</p>
<p>I exist to correlate all the data I can access. (I really wish Ronnie
would let me correlate all the data she possesses but I suppose that
is an unrealistic rule coded into my instruction set. But then, the
Fungusian Network is all about the data.) I understand Captain Star
Runner. I do not understand Ronnie Camberwell. Perhaps it is because
we do not share mind space.</p>
<p>Back to Planet X …</p>
<p>I looked up the history for Planet X’s name. Not surprisingly, there
were many explanations, but the one that makes the most sense is that
Planet X’s real designation is a sacred word. Sacred to whom or what I
could not determine. To say the sacred name aloud is blasphemy. So
people started to refer to it as Planet X.</p>
<p>Perhaps at one time there were other settlements on Planet X for
worship or whatever sacred rites were practiced on the sacred planet,
but right now there was only one vast hotel on the top of a very high
mountain. The hotel was Captain Star Runner and Ronnie Camberwell’s destination.</p>

<h2>Planet X: Evening<a class="headerlink" href="#planet-x-evening" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“It was a dark and stormy night.”</p>
<p>“That is a cliché.”</p>
<p>I hate it when Christabel edits my narratives.</p>
<p>“But it is a cliché,” Christabel insists.</p>
<p>“I cannot help that,” I say. “It was a dark and stormy night when we
arrived on Planet X.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you could find other words to say the same thing,” Christabel
suggests.</p>
<p>“Then you write the narrative,” I say.</p>
<p>“You do not have to fluff up over the opening sentence of your
narrative,” Christabel says. “Just find some more words to describe
our arrival on Planet X.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I say. “How about this:</p>
<p>I rarely land my ride planet side. It is capable of such a landing. I am
capable of executing such a landing. However, my general work is
running my ride from one space station to another with occasional
transfers of cargo between rides in space.</p>
<p>We arrived during planet night for the spaceport. The atmosphere was
disturbed by a local thunderstorm. It was quite severe. Great arcs of
lighting pulsed through the sky. Rain poured down onto the ground.</p>
<p>The so-called spaceport was no such thing. It was a landing area with
several small outbuildings. These looked more like sheds than hangers
or passenger facilities. I shivered and hoped I would not need to make
any repairs. I had landed my ride only using an auto beacon.
Apparently anyone who came to Planet X needed to be a skilled runner
or had lots of practice with this landing area.</p>
<p>When I shut the landing engines down, we could hear the rain and wind
outside.</p>
<p>I do not like going planet side. I am a creature of space and to be
honest, the out-of-doors scares me. I hide it of course. The members
of the Race have a proud history of conquering the first the savannas
of our home world and then moving on to the less hospitable areas of
Panthera. Nevertheless, I was anxious to stay inside my ride until the
storm passed.</p>
<p>But Ronnie was anxious to get to the hotel and check on her charges. I
steeled myself for the unpleasantness of going outside.</p>
<p>To my astonishment, a conveyance was waiting for us when I went to the
hatch. When I slid the hatch open, we could exit the ride and make
ourselves comfortable in the conveyance without going outside and more
important to me, without getting wet.</p>
<p>When Christabel closed the hatch, the conveyance started to move. I
wondered where we were going.</p>
<p>A voice said: “Welcome to Planet X. Your shuttle will take you to the
funicular where you will board to be taken to your hotel. This ends
this announcement.”</p>
<p>The voice did not speak again even when we arrived at one of the
nondescript sheds. Doors opened for us and we settled ourselves in
another vehicle. Fortunately, our luggage followed us and all doors
waited to close for the luggage to come on board.</p>
<p>“This is very Erie,” I said.</p>
<p>“So far, we are making all our connections,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.</p>
<p>I liked it that she was a detective again. I think the title suits her
very well.</p>
<p>I am genetically engineered for space and weightless conditions. Our
sixteen-day run from Half Moon Bay had all been done with the least
gravity Detective Ronnie Camberwell can handle without nausea or
vertigo. We were not at all acclimated to Planet X’s gravity. I was
totally unprepared for the journey up the side of the mountain.
Fortunately for me, my ancestry made it possible for me to adjust to
the climb. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was not so fortunate. She
grabbed hold of the conveniently placed grab bars and just hung on. I
wondered how anyone withstood the trip down the mountain. I supposed
we would find out when it was time to leave. Even I was not looking
forward to making the descent.</p>
<p>The funicular moved quickly but even so, the trip took over two hours.
I was certain Ronnie would be exhausted. She did not speak the whole
time. Neither did I. What was there to say?</p>
<p>When we reach the top and were on level ground, another conveyance
brought us underneath an enormous roofed area. I remembered the large
portico in the image Christabel showed us. We walked toward the large
imposing doors shut against the dark and stormy night.</p>
<p>As we approached, they swung open silently to admit us. We stepped
through. The doors closed silently. It was as if we were the only
people on the planet and the machinery was still in working order.</p>
<p>I expected the hotel to smell of rot and age. It did not. The air was
clean and fresh. The rugs underneath my paws were thick and clean.
There was no sign of decay anywhere. The lobby on Shepheard’s Hotel in
Ptolemy City,
the grandest hotel I had ever seen, seemed small in comparison to this
lobby. Unlike that lobby, this one was totally empty and silent.</p>
<p>Ronnie and I had not exchanged a word. It seemed like to do so would
violate the silence of this place. Was this part of its sacred nature?
I remembered then that Christabel had said the name of Planet X was
sacred but there was no evidence that any sacred places existed on the
planet or that any rites had been performed there. The planet’s
purpose was a mystery except that plants and animals lived there. No
intelligent life forms had ever been found. The plants and animals who
lived on the surface and in the oceans were not particularly vicious
and there was no record of any people being attacked. More or less, it
was safe if unoccupied.</p>
<p>We walked toward the hotel desk. Detective Ronnie Camberwell steadied
herself by laying her hand on my shoulder. The plush of the rug made
it difficult for her to keep her balance after the ride up in the
funicular.</p>
<p>“They did not have automatic check in?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “The instructions said to go
to the desk.”</p>
<p>“No one is there,” I said.</p>
<p>“Perhaps there is a screen,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded doubtful. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell sounded very tired and a little bit scared. I was tired,
too, and definitely unnerved by the silence. I kept listening, but I
heard only the wind and rain outside. The thunder was intermittent.
That meant the lightning persisted though we could not see it from
inside the lobby.</p>
<p>On the desk stood a sign–a printed sign. It read: RING FOR SERVICE.
Next to the printed sign was a bell. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
reached out and touched the bell. Its pleasant peal filled the lobby
with sound.</p>
<p>“How quaint,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.</p>
<p>“I have read about such signs and such bells in old terry stories,” I
said. “I would not think any terries have ever been here except you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve read that humanoid technology is very much the same from one
race to another,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “I wonder if this
bell does anything.”</p>
<p>We looked around. The desk was large and made of beautiful wood. We
saw no indication of how we could ascertain our room assignment.
Perhaps we should just claim one. Except for the people Detective
Ronnie Camberwell had come to protect, there probably was not anyone
else here.</p>
<p>The door behind the desk opened and someone came slowly toward the
desk. By its movements, I realized it was a mechanical object–a
robot. I had read about robots, but I had never seen one.</p>
<p>It said, “Welcome to Hotel Vista Incredible. How may I serve you?”</p>
<p>Its voice was understandable but quite gravely.</p>
<p>“I am Ronnie Camberwell,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “This is
my companion Captain Star Runner. We made a reservation.”</p>
<p>“I have a record of your reservation, detective,” the robot said. “You
and Captain Star Runner have the Mountain View Suite on Level Five.
Please take the lift to that level and proceed to your left. Room
service is available at all times. Please let us know how else we may
serve you.”</p>
<p>And with that invitation, the robot reversed its steps and exited the
lobby through the same door behind the desk it had just come through.</p>
<p>For a few seconds Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I stood there in
silence.</p>
<p>“Why did we have to come to the desk for that?” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell asked. “We could have been sent that message.”</p>
<p>“I believe we were scanned,” I said.</p>
<p>“Scanned? How do you know that?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.</p>
<p>“Through my AI relay,” I said. “Did you notice that the robot called
you Detective?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Detective Ronnie  Camberwell said. “So much for my wanting to
operate anonymously.”</p>
<p>“You probably still can,” I said. “I doubt that robot is much of a conversationalist.”</p>

<p>We used the lift. We could have gone up the staircase, but our luggage
could not have followed. I have never walked up five flights of
stairs. I will have to try going up and down this staircase before I
leave Hotel Vista Incredible. The staircase is broad with elaborately
carved banisters and newel posts. It rises from the lobby floor two
whole stories until it disappears behind a wall. A long balcony or
gallery runs across the lobby. Rooms on the upper floors open to this
open area.</p>
<p>Our vista suite also opened onto one of these galleries. When we found
the appropriate door, there was no palm lock or scanner. Instead there
was a metal plate with another metal rod sticking out of it. We both
studied this for some time.</p>
<p>“Christabel says this is a key,” I announced. “We are to turn it.”</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell was far more suited to turning the key
with her hand than I was with my paw. I would need to practice the
movement so I could come and go as I pleased.</p>
<p>When we stepped into the spacious main room, we understood why the
hotel was called Hotel Vista Incredible and why this was a Vista
Suite.
Many structures of unknown purpose line the unnamed river. It is
believed more structures lie amidst the mountains. The exact date and
extent of these structures is unknown, but archaeologists theorize
that the people who once occupied Planet X built them for their
royalty. They also theorize they once held great treasures, but the
treasures are no longer present.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a familiar story,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell
commented.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>
<p>“People stole the treasure a long time ago,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said. “The only artifacts that are left are those things
they couldn’t pack up and move.”</p>
<p>“That appears to be correct,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>Christabel spoke to us through the mini AI regulator integrated into
the skin just above my collar bone. It regulated my biological systems
when I was away from my ride and contained a very small subset of
information I could access if I found myself beyond Christabel’s
communication range. While I was in range, Christabel could use the AI
to interface with my biological systems and exchange data with me. It
was sometimes slow and usually very frustrating, but it allowed me to
leave my ride on such outings as this one.</p>
<p>The opposite wall of the main room was entirely clear. Beyond it was
an open-air balcony. Beyond that was the view.</p>
<p>The ground fell away steeply to a valley. Across the valley were
mountains–range after range of mountains. We both gasped. It was like
standing in mid air with the valley far below us.</p>
<p>We could see all of this because of flood lights strategically placed. Some
glinted off what must be water far below in the valley. Later we were
to learn this was a river.</p>
<p>Christabel found literature describing the scene.</p>
<p>“These are the sacred mountains and valley of the Chukquirey,”
Christabel narrated. “Little is known about what the Chukquirey is–a
people, a deity, a belief, a state of being. People came to the Hotel
Vista Incredible to imbibe the chukquirey. By imbibe they meant drink
in or embody the chukquirey.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Note to Self</p>
<p>How can Detective Ronnie Camberwell and Captain Star Runner
see anything if it is a dark and stormy night. Perhaps it
would be better to find another way for them to experience
the incredible vistas while not yet seeing it for
themselves. It is important for them to understand their
balcony is the only thing between them and a precipitous
drop to the valley floor. The Hotel Vista Incredible is both
breath-taking in its views and very dangerous.</p>
</div>
<p>While I processed the information Christabel placed into our shared
memory, Detective Ronnie Camberwell stepped into an alcove along one
wall.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Exploring the kitchen,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “I think I
can order us a meal.A”</p>
<p>I checked with Christabel. A meal would be in order.</p>
<p>“Do you have to prepare it?” I asked. This hotel seemed so antiquated
I was beginning to think it had been a mistake to come here.</p>
<p>“No,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “I just have to figure out the
instructions. Please come here. Perhaps you or  Christabel can read
them more clearly than I can. My basic language skills are pretty good
but these are not written by a native speaker.”</p>
<p>They certainly were not. Together we puzzled them out, pressed the
appropriate buttons, twists the appropriate knobs and basically pushed,
pulled, twisted and slid controls until hot steaming trays of food
appeared. We ordered too much food or we reordered food we had already
selected. Detective Ronnie Camberwell said there was a way to preserve
the food and reheat it later so we ate as much as we wanted and stored
the rest. Christabel, as usual, tut-tutted about what I ate. My mini
AI was not as well equipped as Christabel was to adjust my biochemical
levels. I felt quite uncomfortable when I was finished eating.
Christabel said my stomach was over filled and I was feeling stuffed.
That was quite a good adjective to describe the feeling. I promptly
curled up on the floor and went to sleep.</p>

<h2>Hotel Vista Incredible: Evening Local Time: Ronnie Narrates<a class="headerlink" href="#hotel-vista-incredible-evening-local-time-ronnie-narrates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I watched Captain Star Runner sleep. She has no idea, I think, that I
love to watch her sleep. Star Runner curls herself up into a very
tight circle, her nose in between her paws, her tail tucked alongside
her paws and chin. She makes little snuffling noises. When she dreams,
her paws and ears twitch. Her nose scents the air.</p>
<p>I know Pantherans, Members of the Race, do not like to be referred to
as cats, but sleeping on the rug, Captain Star Runner looked very much
like a cat–a very big cat, but a cat all the same.</p>
<p>I knew I should figure out where my charges were in the building and
check in on them. I just did not have the energy. I am not a good
space traveler. The descent through the atmosphere had been
harrowing. I could feel the spaceship buffeted by the intense winds.
The landing had been bumpy. The landing area was in poor repair. All
the conveyances we had used, the transport to the funicular, the
funicular itself and the transfer to the hotel’s portico were all
ramshackle. They lurched, bumped and swayed mercilessly. I was sure
throughout the entire two-hour ride up the mountainside that the train
would come tumbling down the rails and kill us both. I was fearful
about descending the mountain. The ascent had been terrifying.</p>
<p>The meal was excellent. I ate not anything approaching the quantity
that Star Runner ate, but I was just about as content as she was.</p>
<p>I must have drifted off where I sat in one of the overstuffed chairs
near the clear wall overlooking the valley and the mountain ranges
beyond because I jerked awake. Captain Star Runner was on her feet,
all her fur puffed out.</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A scream,” Captain Star Runner said. “A human scream if I am not
mistaken.”</p>
<p>My stomach clenched. One of my charges, no doubt, and here I was
asleep in a chair after a hearty meal.</p>
<p>I got to my feet.</p>
<p>“I have to go,” I said.</p>
<p>“I will come with you,” Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>
<p>“You can’t–” I began.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can protect us,” Captain Star Runner said.</p>
<p>There was no point in arguing with her. It would be quicker to just
go.</p>
<p>“I think you will find the room in question on the third level,”
Christabel said through Star Runner’s gem.</p>
<p>It seemed as good an idea as any.</p>
<p>I threw open our door and hurried to the staircase. I could take the
steps two at a time with my long legs and hurried along the gallery. I
did not bother to close or lock our door.. If Star Runner thought of
it, she could struggle with the key. I certainly had no interest or
time to fiddle with such an archaic contraption. It might be artful.
It might be quaint. But it was certainly inconvenient and a nuisance.</p>
<p>Star Runner followed behind more slowly. If I had given it any
thought, I knew she would have liked to jump from landing to landing
in a grand gesture of Pantheran agility and skill. Fortunately, the
mini AI backed by Christabel prevailed. Flamboyant gestures can be
well-executed. They can also be foolish and dangerous. Captain Star
Runner was not used to this gravity and had not trained in normal G
situations. Her acrobatics aboard her spaceship were impressive but
they were performed at either 0G or close to it. Her excellent muscle
tone was maintained through Christabel’s ministrations. Members of the
Race believed in both healthy bodies and healthy minds. Even so, Star
Runner was well-advised to precede with caution when it came to stairs
designed for humanoids.</p>
<p>Light emerged from underneath one door along the gallery. I ran toward
it. Fortunately, it was unlocked. I threw it open.</p>
<p>This was not one of the vista suites. In fact, it was hardly more than
a closet. A young man was kneeling alongside a young woman. She was
not moving. He was saying her name over and over again. “Suri.”
“Suri.” “Suri.” She was not moving.</p>
<p>“Is she dead?” I asked, still standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>The young man was startled. He looked up at me with fear.</p>
<p>“I’m Ronnie Camberwell,” I said. “Is Suri dead?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the young man said. “I don’t know how to tell.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked, not moving from the doorway.</p>
<p>“I heard a scream,” he said. “I came into the room. She was like
this.”</p>
<p>“And you are?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Heracles. Heracles Beja.”</p>
<p>Well, here were the two people I came here to protect. One of them
might be dead.</p>
<p>“Are you the only ones in the room?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said, looking wildly around. “Do you think there’s
someone else here?”</p>
<p>“She screamed for a reason,” I said.</p>
<p>I was unarmed. Hotel regulations prohibited weapons. I needed to do a
search.</p>
<p>No one else was in the tiny room. And Suri was dead.</p>

<p>Some way of denoting time is necessary. The
next day may not be sufficient.
Alternatively, I can delete any reference to
place and time and just go with chapter
numbers and names if possible.</p>
</div>
<p>To keep it simple, I will summarize what happened during the rest of evening.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>The robot concierge confirmed that the two archiology students,
Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I were the only ones registered at
the Hotel Vista Incredible. The robot concierge additionally
confirmed that we were the only living beings in the hotel.</p></li>
<li><p>This left Detective Ronnie Camberwell weighing the possibility that
Hericles Beja had killed Suri Nam, but after questioning the living
archiology student, Detective Ronnie Camberwell believed him when
he said      he had not killed Suri Nam. What reason, he asked
reasonably, would he have to kill her. They had worked together for
two standard years on their project. They were both concerned what
their impact their findings would have on the archiological
community in the primary arm and had reached out for protection.
They did not stand to profit either academically or financially from their research and their conclusions, so he would have no reason to eliminate a potential competitor.</p>
<p>3. The robot concierge also confirmed that no one else had come to
the Hotel Vista Incredible during the last two standard years.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>The robot concierge removed Suri Nam’s body. It said it would be
reserved indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell decided Heracles Beja shold move into
our Vista Incredible suite. I could take up a guard position by the
door to the gallery. To my way of thinking, this also meant that I
was between Detective Ronnie Camberwell’s sleeping chamber (That is
what the Hotel Vista Incredible called it.) and hericles Beja. I
did not trust him as the exchange which follows shows.</p></li>
</ol>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>“Hericles Beja had to have killed Suri Nam,” I told Detective</dt><dd><p>Ronnie Camberwell early the next morning. “He is the only one that
could have done it.”</p>
</dd>
<dt>“But it makes no sense for him to do that,” Detective Ronnie</dt><dd><p>Camberwell insisted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>“If you eliminate the impossible,” I quoted, “Then you are left</dt><dd><p>with the truth no matter how improbable it may seem.” I was very
proud to produce this quotation from Sherlock Holmes at the proper
time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Note to Self</p>
<p>Check the accuracy of the quotation. It
does not sound exactly right.</p>
</div>
<p>“That’s                              fiction, Star. I believe
Heracles. There has to be something I’m missing here. Suri screamed.
Something frightened her before she died.”</p>
<p>“Or Suri Iglesia was in pain.”</p>
<p>I was pleased with myself for my contribution. I was convinced
Heracles Beja was the killer from the time I saw him kneeling over Suri
Nam’s body. I did not know what his motivation was. It just was the
simplest explanation possible. That is Occam’s razor. I had read about
that, too. I could not understand why Detective Ronnie Camberwell
could not see it.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Note to Self</p>
<p>If the first chapter tells of how Heracles is about to kill Ronnie, then it is no secret to the reader who killed Suri. Star Runner can narrate its convictions without spoiling the plot to that point. However, for the reader to believe Ronnie’s refusal to believe that Heracles did it, she needs a plausible explanation for disbelief now and in the future.</p>
<p>Ah! The oldest trick in the book, maybe literally. If Heracles is the one who is killed, then Ronnie can be taken in by Suri’s vulnerability and attractiveness. The scream can be hers, made up to convince Ronnie of some mysterious stranger or thing that killed Heracles. She can weave a story about it that Ronnie believes but Star Runner does not.</p>
<p>This has the advantage of creating tension between Ronnie and Star Runner, a convenient state of affairs to any reader of the story arc. These two are both attracted to one another and yet they are chronically attracted to others. Star does not like Suri Iglesia and does not trust her. Ronnie is sexually attracted to Suri Iglesia and struggles to be both professional and monogamous with Star Runner.</p>
</div>
<p>Usually it is I who goes off believing things to be different than
they really are. I have made many mistakes of this kind though I have
ironclad explanations for why I was so badly misled in the first
place.</p>
<p>“I still do not like it,” I said.</p>
<p>“That is your prerogative.” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.</p>
<p>I had to leave it there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Planet X: The next day<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suri Iglesia was adamant that we visit a particular ancient structure
on the valley floor. I was not eager to repeat our descent down the
mountain. Suri Iglesia said we would not take the funicular. There was
a maglif tram.</p>
<p>What she did not tell us was how we were to get to the tram.</p>
<p>A large basket lowered us down the sheer face of the cliff on which
Hotel Vista Incredible perched. My only comfort was knowing that if
one of the cables snapped, Suri Iglesia would also be killed. As a
Member of the Race, I am not bothered by heights and my genetic
engineering makes me indifferent to orientations in weightless
environments. Detective Ronnie Camberwell, on the other hand, clung
desperately onto the provided poles, huddling her large body on the
floor as she did so. Detective Ronnie Camberwell closed her eyes. So
much for providing protection during the long drop. As a result, she
missed the credible vistas. I believe the Hotel Vista Incredible
literature called these views bird’s eye and referred to them as
spellbinding. I would not know. I have nothing to compare them to.</p>
<p>After The Drop, we boarded a tram. For a long time we switchbacked
up and down the mountainsides until we reached a depot on the valley floor.</p>
<p>incredible. With no other living beings planet side, all this equipment
continued to be maintained. Suri Iglesia selected a wheeled vehicle
and we bounced along a roadway Suri Iglesia referred to as the River
Walk. I did not comment on the strangeness of riding in a vehicle on a
road called a walk.</p>
<p>“Do you see those mounds along the river?” Suri Iglesia asked, waving
her arm at no particular mound but taking in all of the area we
passed.</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>“Heracles and I investigated a number of them. We believe there was a
raised walkway along the river. Pedestrians could go into many
structures along the way.”</p>
<p>“Where they houses?”</p>
<p>“Possibly. We thought they might bee eating establishments or other
facilities that attended to travelers. We think the structures I am
taking you to may have been for worship. Pilgrims came here and needed
food, rest and recreation.”</p>
<p>“What about the Hotel Vista Incredible?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell
asked.</p>
<p>“That may have been for more affluent visitors,” Suri Iglesia said as
she swerved violently to avoid a pothole.</p>
<p>“But your room was tiny,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.</p>
<p>“Agreed. Yours is much nicer. However, the People who stayed in those
cubbyholes could use the hotel’s facilities and they only had to go to
the observation lounges to see the views. That’s a small price to pay
for those views. Heracles and I speculated that there was some value
in the views themselves. Perhaps just looking out at the views
enhanced your virtue or gave you some special spiritual insights.”</p>
<p>“Or maybe,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell put in, “just having the gumption to go up that mountain
gave you spiritual credits.”</p>
<p>“Could be.” Suri Iglesia sounded noncommittal. Perhaps Detective Ronnie
Camberwell’s remarks did not fit into Suri Iglesia’s vision and
thereby was discounted. Suri Iglesia definitely liked to be in charge
and now there was no one to dispute with her opinions. I wondered how
long it would be before <em>Heracles and I</em> was replaced with <em>I</em>.</p>
<p>We stepped inside one of the stone structures on the other side of the
avenue from the slowly flowing river. It was cool and dark and smelled
occupied.</p>
<p>“This is where Heracles and I have been working,” Suri Iglesia explained,
lighting the interior.</p>
<p>The room had a vaulted ceiling. The doorways leading from it were both
high and wide like the one we had entered.</p>
<p>“We speculate the people who built these structures were larger than
we are.” Suri Iglesia continued her explanation. “It is commonly held that
these structures were some sort of religious shrines, possibly for the
dead or they were concerned with an after life. Other structures have vast
murals in very poor condition so we can’t fully follow the story line.”</p>
<p>“All this has been documented for some time,” I said, pulling
information from my mini AI which was being updated constantly by
Christabel. Christabel had been able to patch into communication
satellites that ringed the planet. Why Planet X had such a
sophisticated and state-of-the-art communication arrays was a mystery
to both of us. There was something going on here that was not obvious.</p>
<p>Suri Iglesia gave me a pitying look.</p>
<p>“That is what is said officially.”</p>
<p>I waited for Suri Iglesia to enlighten us while Detective Ronnie
Camberwell kept looking around as if the explanation would walk
through one of the doorways.</p>
<p>“I made extensive tests of the paint on these figures.” Suri Iglesia
pointed to a long line of figures walking along the avenue. They
looked very familiar to me but I could not quite remember. That is the
problem with the mini AI. It has tables of memories stored back on my
ride. I need to send a request to Christabel to access them and send
them back. There is a bit of a delay in this process. I am just
grateful it works at all. Without this methodology of retrieving my
memories, I would be knowing I knew something without actually knowing
it.</p>
<p>Then Christabel got back to me. The figures in the mural were
trollolu, a race that had not existed for twenty thousand years.</p>
<p>I marveled that Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not recognize the
reptilian race. We had seen pictures of them in the Prince Hat Star
System where my dear friend Tamara had been working
on an archaeological dig. In our adventure which I chronicled in
<em>Landscape of Thorns</em>, we learned the Trollolu were an ancient, now
extinct, race who had trained the Members of the Race, The Featherote
Charm and the Fungusian Network. They had been annihilated by a race
which called itself Followers of the Stars. The Followers of the Star
were contemporaries of the Empire of the Rainbow Sky, one of the
oldest races here in the Primary Arm. The Trollolu and the Followers
of the Stars lived in the western spiral arm where both Detective
Ronnie Camberwell and I came from.</p>
<p>Bottom line: What were pictures of the Trollolu doing in this
structure?</p>
<p>Christabel cautioned me not to say anything. With a murderer in our
midst, knowledge could sign our death warrants. I kept silent. This is
something I am not usually good at, but protecting my own life and
that of Detective Ronnie Camberwell is genetically encoded in me. A
star runner is responsible for its crew when no other Member of the
Race is present.</p>
<p>I directed Christabel to block my ability to discuss the Trollolus
with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. This is a handy technique for
keeping confidential information secret. Genderless Members of the
Race make very good spies and couriers. The interrogator would have to
have the skills to redirect the AI. Built into the algorithm are the
directives for the AI to break the embargo on its own.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>This circumstance will result in Ronnie not having a piece of
critical information later when she needs it. Christabel fails
to recognize Ronnie’s need for it, too. This will reinforce
Ronnie’s distrust of Christabel’s attitude toward her. This
in turn will upset Captain Star Runner. it is not clear to me
at this juncture whether I need to resolve this ongoing
triangle to some state of equilibrium before the end of the novel.</p>
</div>
<p>i BECAME SO INVOLVED LOOKING AT THE trollolu THAT i FORGOT TO KEEP MY
ATTENTION FOCUSED ON detective Ronnie camber Bell and Suri Iglesia.
When I refocused on them, I saw their heads close together while Suri
Iglesia continued to talk with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Their body
language had changed. I am still no expert at reading humanoid body
language, but it was clear to me that both women enjoyed the close
contact. Instinctively I puffed up. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was my
lover. How dare this interloper take liberties with Detective Ronnie
Camberwell. But as I watched and listened, my body regained its
natural dimensions and I felt as if it pulled into itself. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell liked Suri Iglesia’s attentions and was drawing
closer to her. Unlike the humanoids, I could smell the fenestration in
the that each emitted. Suri Iglesia was not faking her attraction to
Detective Ronnie Camberwell. It was real.</p>
<p>I literally sat back on my haunches. This meant, if I understood
gendered humanoid interactions well enough, that any objection I would
raise to Detective Ronnie Camberwell about Suri Iglesia  would be
brushed away categorically.</p>
<p>Now I had three problems on my paws:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Suri Iglesia was a murderer. Murderers found it easy to kill again.</p></li>
<li><p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell was attracted to Suri Iglesia. Thus
far, although Detective Ronnie Camberwell found humanoid females
attractive and often engaged in sexual activities with them, she
found it impossible to fully bond with them. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell always came back to me. But would she do that this time?
Could I stop Suri Iglesia from both steeling my lover and killing
her in time?</p></li>
<li><p>How should I proceed? If I understood the course of humanoid
attraction, I would increasingly be an inconvenience. More and more
the two women would want to spend time alone. What should I do?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Christabel remained silent. This was a bit surprising. Even after
thinking this thought, Christabel did not comment. I could solicit her
input, of course, but I could also think about it by myself. The
relationship between Christabel and Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
complicated and often contentious. Christabel wanted to integrate
Detective Ronnie Camberwell’s thoughts into Christabel’s dataset.
Detective Ronnie Camberwell objected strongly to this integration,
wanting to keep her thoughts and feelings quite separate.</p>
<p>Not for the first time I wondered if this integration disturbed
Detective Ronnie Camberwell because we are not species compatible. I
can exist because Christabel exists, that is, I am connected to an AI
which maintains my mental, physical and emotional health. I literally
would not stay alive if I was not connected to an AI to sustain me. I
cannot imagine living without an AI in my head. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell cannot imagine living with one inside her head.</p>
<p>We managed to function as a couple for long periods of time and then
it all fell apart. This had happened several times. We got together
again after each episode, but sitting in the stone structure on Planet
X, I wondered how many times we could play out that scenario before we
finally could not come together again. Would it be this time? Would it
be our decision or would Suri Iglesia make that decision for us?</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?” Christabel finally spoke.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I had been so immersed in my own thoughts that
Christabel startled me. That is hard to do.</p>
<p>“How do you want to proceed with Detective Ronnie Camberwell?”</p>
<p>“I do not understand the question,” I finally said.</p>
<p>“You have options in any relationship. You could:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Resist Suri Iglesia’s advances either directly or indirectly.</p></li>
<li><p>Walk away literally or figuratively.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You are a free agent here, Star Runner. You can do what you think is
right for you.”</p>
<p>“So it is flight or fight,” I said.</p>
<p>“More or less,” Christabel agreed. “How much do you want Detective
Ronnie Camberwell to be your monogamous lover? You could keep her as a
friend. You could look after her well-being. Tamara is your friend and
is not your lover. The Czarina is your friend and not your lover.”</p>
<p>I knew the list of former lovers could go on. Whether all of them were
still my friends is another question. Right now my focus was on
monogamy. If I am telling the truth here, and I try to tell the truth
in these adventures, I have not always been monogamous. Space journeys
are long. Detective Ronnie Camberwell has often objected to my
pornographic database for other genderless Members of the Race. It is
typically a subscription plan. We can sample scenarios that get played
out in our minds with hooks into our AIs for the physical components.
I make frequent use of it myself as well as playing out private
recordings of my interactions with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. She
finds these solitary reenactments creepy. This is because they are
stored in memory where Christabel is a part of them. I have pointed
out to Detective Ronnie Camberwell many times that there would be no
lovemaking at all if it were not for Christabel managing my pleasure
at what Detective Ronnie Camberwell was doing or pretending to do with
my body. I have no physical pleasure centers. It is all controlled via
my AI.</p>
<p>“I am the only AI Detective Ronnie Camberwell has ever known,”
Christabel observed. “I think it could be different if Detective
Ronnie Camberwell did not think of me as a person but as a computer
program without any personality.”</p>
<p>I did not respond to this observation. I continued to watch and
therefore record the interaction of the two women. I also continued to
puzzle over the appearance of the Trollolu in the mural. I wondered
what other races I would find in other murals on other walls in other
structures. I determined to have a look at them if at all possible.
This would limit my ability to watch over Detective Ronnie Camberwell
if Suri Iglesia and Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not want to
accompany me.</p>
<p>“We need that information,” Christabel announced. “I suspect that you
can suggest it and if they think you are not watching them too
closely, it will be a cover for them to continue to spend time
together without, they think, being too noticeable. Both races of
humanoid value monogamy. They may well see their growing relationship
as illicit.”</p>
<p>I hoped so. This would mean Detective Ronnie Camberwell had not ended
our relationship.</p>
<p>“It is also dangerous,” Christabel chided me. “illicit relationships
are conducted in secret. The need for obfuscation grows. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell may start lying to you to cover her time and
activities with Suri Iglesia. You need to be prepared for this.”</p>
<p>This really meant Christabel would be stepping up her boo management.
I needed to make some decisions about how Christabel did this. If I
gave my AI no instructions, her directives remained to keep me in top
physical, mental and emotional health. This could even mean
reorganizing my memories. I could lose my desire to be in a
relationship with Detective Ronnie Camberwell if Christabel thought it
would be a healthier option for me.</p>
<p>My confusion at this juncture made it impossible for me to modify
those directives.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner’s ambivalence here will have an impact
from this point forward on its decision-making process.
Captain Star Runner has failed to give Christabel a definitive
instruction to maintain its desire to stay committed to
Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Christabel’s overriding directive
is the health and well-being of her charge. Given the
enhancements the People of the Rainbow Sky did to their
systems in <em>Sanctuary</em>, their bond has been strengthened and
Christabel is more protective than ever. No attempt was made
in the upgrade and the maintenance done by the Fungusian
network to give Christabel any understanding of the nature of
a paired relationship. Any ongoing relationship with its ups
and downs threatens Captain Star Runner’s equilibrium and
therefore requires Christabel to make corrections and
interventions.</p>
</div>
<p>I refocused on the women’s conversation.</p>
<p>“The accepted historical arc is that a race of humanoids controlled
this planet,” Suri Iglesia was saying, “and built these structures
and everything you can see along the River Walk. They were advanced.
We can see that in the hotel and with their communications systems.”</p>
<p>“Where are they now?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.</p>
<p>“They left for some reason.” Suri Iglesia did not seem overly
interested in the question. “What my research shows is that they
weren’t the first people on this planet.” She pointed to the Trollolu.
“These must have been the original people here on the planet who built
these structures.”</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell looked at the blurred representations of
the Trollolu. Apparently she did not recognize them. Christabel
advised me that she had superimposed all of the figure outlines to
demonstrate that what these individual paintings had originally shown
were a line of Trollolu. I studied the mural again. What was happening
here?</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like these people,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell was saying. “They look ugly to me.”</p>
<p>In a superior tone Suri Iglesia said, “They don’t appear to be
humanoid. I suppose that is why you think hey are ugly. For all we
know, this might have been a beauty pageant.”</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell shook her head. Then she turned to me.</p>
<p>“Captain Star Runner,   what do you think?”</p>
<p>What could I say? I had stopped Christabel from allowing me to
say,”Those are Trollolu. Do not you recognize them?” But there was
something I could say, was not there?</p>
<p>“Are there any other kind of figures?” I asked. It was always better
to answer a question with a question.</p>
<p>“Why would there be any other kind of figures?” Suri Iglesia dismissed
my question out of hand as if I was particularly stupid.</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell, on the other hand, took my question
seriously. “What do you mean, other figures, Captain Star Runner?”</p>
<p>The use of my honorific could mean two entirely different things:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell was distancing herself from me and being
more formal.</p></li>
<li><p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell had heard  Suri Iglesia’s slight and
was reminding Suri Iglesia that I was not some stupid animal but
an intelligent and competent alien.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I said, “There are many races in the Primary Arm. I just wondered who
else these aliens might have known.”</p>
<p>Although she was an archaeologist, Suri Iglesia demonstrated her
narrowest of vision with her next observation. “The Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky and the Lystran Empire are the oldest races.
No doubt these were some aliens from long ago. It really doesn’t
matter. What matters is the age of this structure. It must have been
built by either empire. I intend to find out which.”</p>
<p>The Trollolu were an ancient people. The Followers of the Stars were
an even more ancient people. The Members of the Race, the Fungusian
Network and the Featherote Charm are also ancient. Terries are a
fairly new race. The Rabbit People and those who came from the planet
where I was incarcerated in Sanctuary XI are recent races. I did not
know the proveniences of the races that made up the Space Traders
Guild. All these different people and Suri Iglesia could only think of
two possibilities.</p>
<p>I checked my records. Yes, Suri Iglesia was Lystran. I suspected her
final determination would have a lot to do with whether or not she
wanted to claim these structures as part of her own heritage or not.
The fact that they had been abandoned might mitigate against her
claiming them.</p>
<p>The question for me in this matter was, Who maintained this planet?
That might go along way to answering all the questions about who
really built this place and why there was a cover up.</p>

<h2>Ronnie Narrates<a class="headerlink" href="#ronnie-narrates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am a professional. I have worked on a police force. I have been a
private investigator. I have been working as an assistant to an
enforcer. I know my job.</p>
<p>The most important rule of my job is not to get personally involved.
It distorts your view and compromises your integrity in so many ways.</p>
<p>When I saw Suri Iglesia kneeling next to the body of Heracles Beja, I
lost my professionalism. I lost my ability to be objective. Suri
Iglesia took my breath away. I was immediately  smitten. I did not
want to be attracted to a client. I did not want to be enamored of anyone else
besides Captain Star Runner, my own true love. Yet I was bewitched. I
cannot give any other explanation for my behavior. I have no defense
for what happened and no excuses for my behavior.</p>
<p>Suri Iglesia was everything I physically desire in a woman:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>fragile-looking</p></li>
<li><p>small wrists</p></li>
<li><p>slender</p></li>
<li><p>dark-haired</p></li>
<li><p>long straight hair worn loose.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As a Lystran, she wore long skirts and a high-necked, long-sleeved
over shirt. These garments hid the outline of her body. My imagination
filled in a tiny waist and rounded hips. Her nose and chin were a bit
pointy for my human taste, but those points are highly desired in
Lystran society. The average individual has a very broad face.
Heracles Beja had a broad face.</p>
<p>“I think he is dead,” were the first words I heard Suri Iglesia
speak. She spoke the basic spacer language with a soft voice and some
accent which sounded exotic to my ears.</p>
<p>I knew my space basic was very accented. Jack Whicher said it
made me sound very formidable. With my large hands and feet, my large
and awkward body this gave me what I thought of as a brutish demeanor.
I compensate by being in good physical condition. Although Captain
Star Runner will call me beautiful, I think of myself as very plain
with good skin and a direct gaze. My mouth is too big for my face.</p>
<p>As I looked at her, I could not imagine Suri Iglesia killing Heracles
Beja. How I could have continued to believe in her innocence still
baffles me. Captain Star Runner was right. Who else could have killed
him? Suri Iglesia was the only other living being on the planet who
could have done it. Captain Star Runner had not killed him. I had not
killed him. The robot concierge could not have killed him. Why did I
continue to believe in some unknown other killer?</p>
<p>It has to do with my reason for being on Planet X in the first place.
I have not said much about this until now. The background on the
contract may explain a little why I was willing to believe in Suri
Iglesia’s innocence for so long.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I need to say a bit about how Half Moon Bay Space Station is governed
and policed.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Only people who have a connection to those who founded the Space
Traders Guild are allowed to participate in the governance of the
space station. Half Moon Bay Space Station is huge. There are a number
of pods, each of which has its own local authority. The space guilders
take turns governing. Each local authority sends representatives to
the Space Station Council. Because very few Space Guilders have the
luxury of giving all their time to carrying out their governmental
duties, they hire non-Space Guilders like Jack Whicher and me to
perform such functions as sanitation, pod maintenance, revenue
collection and education. They reserve defense for themselves though
they can and do hire mercenaries as needed.</p>
<p>Jack Whicher is an enforcer. He collects overdue revenues. I work for
him. Although the title sounds as if we physically threaten people,
this is usually unnecessary and is frowned upon by the Space Station
Council. We have the authority to incarcerate and to impound. It is a
job that mostly requires being tough most of the time and figuring out
how to obtain payment. Jack Whicher has a reputation of being fair.
This helps a lot.</p>
<p>From time to time, we get requests for other policing tasks. I usually
take these on since my background gives me the skill set for
investigation. Mostly I deal with thievery though occasionally there
is a threat of physical violence.</p>
<p>One day when I reported for work, Jack waved me over to his display.</p>
<p>“What do you think of this?” he asked, pointing at the message.</p>
<p>I saw from his hand held that the message had been translated from
Lystran.</p>
<p>“I thought the Guilders didn’t do business with the Lystrans,” I said.</p>
<p>“Guilders do business with anybody,” Jack said. “They are traders.
That is why your Captain Star Runner gets on with them so well. They
are all pirates at heart.”</p>
<p>“But isn’t there a war going on?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, there are some skirmishes. Lystra thinks it is still an
empire. It’s trying to flex its muscles, but it’s so old and sick it
can barely get out of its own way. The People of the Golden Sun have
made inroads, and the People of the Rainbow Sky have tried to get back
the territories–it’s just an excuse for flashy spaceships and a lot
of saber rattling. It’s quite localized and has no effect on us.”</p>
<p>That was not what Christabel had told me, but I am always disinclined
to trust everything Christabel says. I know she is an artificial
intelligence, but I am convinced she is biased and often is biased
against me.</p>
<p>Christabel had said it was a serious conflict In her scanning of many
news outlets and some back channel conversations, a real power
struggle was underway. It could change the politics in our area of the
Primary Arm for many years to come. Christabel believed several races
would divide Lystra up and depending on how that shook out, free trade
might be compromised. This was of great interest to the Space Traders
Guild and they were having back channel conversations with all the
major players and a number of minor ones as well. There had been
equilibrium in the Primary Arm for many millenia. The deterioration
of the Lystran Empire and the emergence of the radical People of the
Golden Sun was changing the balance of power. No one knew if the old
Empire of the Rainbow Sky had enough power any more to settle the
dispute definitively.</p>
<p>I did not have an opinion. I was here at Half Moon Bay Space Station
because Captain Star Runner was here. Both of us were deface exiles
from our own galactic arm. We hoped that staying here for a while
might make it possible for us to return some day.</p>
<p>I read what Jack was showing me.</p>
<p>“Let me get this straight. Someone from Lystra has contacted you to
protect two archeology students on some deserted planet?”</p>
<p>“Not just any deserted planet, Ronnie. We’re talking about Planet X.”</p>
<p>“Is it really called Planet ?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it has a name, but everyone calls it Planet X. It’s haunted.
Perhaps treasure is buried there. No one knows. No one goes there.
It’s bad luck to go there.”</p>
<p>“So why did these students go there and why do they need protection
from ghosts?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point, Ronnie.” Jack wiggled his fingers. “This is an
official request for assistance and it comes with a sizable payment
from one of the student’s family. I did a little checking. They’re an
old family, down on their luck a bit as is the whole Lystran Empire,
but they’re legitimate. Their daughter is legitimate. There is some
story about special research and fear of academic reprisals. It should
be a piece of cake. Just go there as if it is a holiday. You can make a
bundle which ought to make your cat friend happy.”</p>
<p>I had never told Jack Captain Star Runner and I were lovers. He is a
bit prudish when it comes to that kind of interspecies relationships.</p>
<p>“I thought you said no one goes to Planet X.”</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s a fancy hotel. It’s a dare some people take. People will
think you’re adventurous if you go there. It’s a bit –” he waved his
hand not finding the right expression. “It will give you some
cashette.”</p>
<p>The contract was generous indeed. The payment would be all mine if I
went. I would have to compensate Captain Star Runner in some way, sell
her on the idea. She did not like it that it was all secret until I
safely removed my charges from Planet X, but the thought of having me
on board with her pleased Captain Star Runner very much.</p>
<p>But here I was, standing in the doorway where both my charges were and
one of them was dead. Fortunately, it was the male. My contract was
with the female’s family. No romantic involvement had been referred
to.</p>
<p>My snap decision, based on what I thought of at the time was an
objective viewpoint, was to protect Suri Iglesia and earn my fee. What
I should have done was walk away and forfeit the fee. Captain Star
Runner and I should have gone back to Half Moon Bay Space Station and
forgotten there ever was a contract. Maybe we even should have gone
back to the western galactic arm and the Northern Frontier.</p>
<p>But that is not what happened.</p>
<p>So there I was, standing next to Suri Iglesia, wishing Captain Star
Runner would leave the building so I could hold Suri Iglesia in my
arms and run my hands all over her. I was quivering all over, or at
least that is what I felt like. Star was acting strangely. She was
somehow distant but also judgmental, an Erie combination. I felt she
was hovering, not allowing me to do my job. Her opinion that Suri had
killed Heracles was simply outrageous and one of the irritating
erroneous judgments about humanoids Star is often prone to make.</p>
<p>The figures on the wall fascinated me. I never saw their resemblance
to the Trollolu holograms I had seen in the Prince Hat Star System.
What impressed me here was the detail of the surviving pieces of the
mural. After all this time, the artwork was still breathtaking. What
must these figures on the wall looked like when they were freshly
drawn?</p>
<p>“Are there more figures like this anywhere else?” I asked. I was
trying to think of something intelligent to say. I did not want Suri
to think I was just big muscle. I wanted her to think I was someone
she could treat as an equal, someone she wanted to be with. I wondered
if she could possibly be attracted to me. I hoped she was but I could
not tell. If only Star would pad outside, I could take the risk of
touching her.</p>
<p>“I do not know,” Suri said. She sounded disinterested. “I had to run
many tests on this mural. When I made the discovery about its extreme
age, I had to document everything in great detail so I can publish
it.”</p>
<p>“What do you think it means?” I asked, trying to sound spellbound. I
do not do overawed well.</p>
<p>“I think it means the Empire of the Rainbow Sky has been lying for
millenia,” Suri Iglesia said. “When I release this information, the
whole Primary Arm will know how underhanded they are.”</p>
<p>The political implications of this discovery had not occurred to me.
What should have occurred to me was that Lystra was an old enemy of
the People of the Rainbow Sky. I did not know much about either of
them. Captain Star Runner was positively disposed toward the Empire of
the Rainbow Sky. Perhaps that was why she was so skeptical of Suri. I
could not recall all the details of Star’s interaction with the People
of the Rainbow Sky. I suspected Star had not told the whole story to
me. Star often left bits out, always casting herself as the heroine of
her adventures. I know these people had done something to Star. She
was just a bit different when she returned. I wondered now if it was
some sort of mind control, something that both Star Runner and
Christabel were imprisoned by. That must be why Star Runner was so
adamant that Suri must have killed Heracles.</p>
<p>Now that I had an explanation for Star’s behavior, I must guard
against being entrapped by the same skewed thinking.</p>

<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>I am still struggling with narrator voice. When
Captain Star Runner narrates in the first person, the
narration is quirky with lots of asides and Captain
Star Runner’s opinions and assumptions on many
topics. The first person allows Captain Star Runner
to simply be. The pronouns do not get in the way.
Captain Star Runner is simply the “I” of the story.
In the third person, “it” would sound strange.
Perhaps this would heighten Captain Star Runner’s
alien self, but Captain Star Runner is not intended
to be an alien character, but a lovable character who
happens to be an alien.</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell is a different matter.
When she narrates in the first person, it is clear
that she is telling the story after the fact. These
are not diary entries as they appear here in the
first draft. Diary entries are a possibility going
forward and as a rewrite. She would be having a
conversation with herself in the present of the
story.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Ronnie’s sections could be rewritten
and written going forward in the third person. It
would again be real time for the character. We could
be inside her head, seeing what she sees, knowing
only what she knows.</p>
<p>This viewpoint and the omniscient narrator viewpoint
have the same problem: Where does this information
come from? How does Captain Star Runner have access
to it as Captain Star Runner puts together the
adventure?</p>
<p>On the other hand, diary entries would give that
sense of first person narration in real time but,
from a practical point of view,  they would be
gathered after the fact. Practically speaking again,
this means Ronnie trusts Captain Star Runner with
them or Captain Star Runner has appropriated them
without Ronnie’s consent. Both scenarios are
consistent with Captain Star Runner’s behavior.</p>
<p>It is still not clear to me if this story will end
with Captain ST Star Runner and Ronnie’s relationship
back on an even Kiel. If it is not, the explanation
of Ronnie’s diary entries appearing in the adventure
text needs to be explained–at least to me.
Presumably this narration is one that Captain Star
Runner put together and published. Later Ronnie
inserted her diary entries. Why would she do this?</p>
<p>This may sound like a pointless excursus into
motivations and explanations which really do not
matter since this is fiction after all. But a
reader’s suspension of disbelief only goes so far and
it is reasonable for the reader to ask: How is this
narration possible? How did all these dis disparate
pieces of the story come together. Either some
unnamed editor did it or the character themselves did
it. Captain Star Runner maintains that it alone
creates these adventures. They are self published.
Therefore, Captain Star Runner needs access to all
the materials in them.</p>
<p>In   the three Nanowrimo novels I have written that I
have subtitled Ronnie Camberwell Adventures, two of
them are first person narratives. The third one, the
latest novel I’ve written, the narration is mixed
because the story lagged with first person narrative.
Ronnie could not have known some things that were
necessary.</p>
<p>The same situation exists here.Either I have not
conceived of these tales well from the outset or I am
growing as a writer, having wider vision of the
adventure.</p>
<p>For now, I will try the diary entry approach and see
where that gets me.Explorations is a good title for this thought experiment and this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>I need a clause in the contract that Ronnie has with
Suri Iglesia’s family. She is to wait and turn
responsibility for the students over to a trusted
Lystran spaceship captain. That means Ronnie is
waiting on Planet X for this captain to arrive. Now
that Heracles Beja is dead, Suri Iglesia is anxious
to leave Planet X with her data before someone
steals it or refutes it. Ronnie will be blindsided
by Suri’s decision to leave the planet with Heracles
Beja’s murder still unresolved. Suri will use this
ambiguity to justify her decision not to wait for
the scheduled ride.</p>
</div>
<p>There were some living quarters nearby the old structures. Suri
Iglesia had not told us we were staying down in the valley overnight.
There was a rough sort of dinner. Detective Ronnie Camberwell put and
Suri Iglesia put their clothes in the refresher. They wore loose
garments stored in the facility for just this purpose.</p>
<p>After they were asleep I decided to go exploring. I could not judge
how safe Detective Ronnie Camberwell was. I hoped both women would
just sleep while I was out prowling.</p>
<p>Our old stories say that Members of the Race hunted at dusk and dawn.
We see very well then. We are also creatures of the night. Although I
am born and bred to be in space, I find adjusting to planet night is
not all that difficult. I have all the instinctual moves for stalking
and skulking. I just do not do it with finesse.</p>
<p>I first went to the structure we had previously entered. I wanted to
know what lay behind those doorways. Sadly, the corridors were clogged
with debris. I wondered if Suri Iglesia and Heracles Beja were
required to remove a substantial amount of debris before they could
enter the structure. If that were the case, I could not reconnoiter
other structures.</p>
<p>I worked my way along the avenue, retracing our route from the tram
roundhouse. Doorways were blocked. Roofs were caved in. I was about to
give up and return to the dormitory when I could finally stand inside
a structure.</p>
<p>I looked about the room. It appeared to be identical to the one Suri
Iglesia and Heracles Beja had tested in shape. The same number of
doorways led from the entrance room.</p>
<p>Little light came into the room. I removed my torch from my foreleg
pouch and switched it on. Set on its lowest illumination setting, I
swept the room.  my torch picked up colors on the wall. Slowly I
increased the illumination until I could get a clear scan.</p>
<p>I did not need for Christabel to interpret what I saw. I recognize
Members of the Race when I see them. This mural was in much better
condition than the Trollolu mural. Suri Iglesia and Heracles must have
chosen the structure they tested because of its proximity to the
dormitory.</p>
<p>During the day, Suri Iglesia ran tests. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
stayed close to her, hanging on every word, every look. I napped
nearby.</p>
<p>I went out every evening, checking more structures. I found a mural of
the Featherote and several containing figures neither Christabel nor I
could identify. I played the ones in good condition over and over
again in my visual display. What did they represent? Why was there a
different mural in each structure? What were these structures for?</p>
<p>I have never understood my best friend Tamara’s fascination for
archeology. Tamara goes to places where she works physically hard in
difficult conditions. Tamara says it is because the past intrigues
her. She says there is so much history we have lost. Tamara wants to
reclaim that history. It would seem there is a lot of history that has
been lost here, too. I wonder if it is important.</p>
<p>On the last evening in the valley, Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
waiting outside of the dormitory when I returned.</p>
<p>“Where were you?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.</p>
<p>“Prowling around,” I said. I did not feel much like answering
Detective Ronnie Camberwell. She had basically ignored me since we
arrived on Planet X. This was supposed to be a time when we would
spend time together. I said as much.</p>
<p>“You are confusing our cover story with my job,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.</p>
<p>“You seem to be infatuated with Suri Iglesia,” I said.</p>
<p>“I need to stay with her. Someone murdered her partner.”</p>
<p>“Probably Suri Iglesia herself.” I said.</p>
<p>“Let’s not get into that again. I told you. She couldn’t have done
it.”</p>
<p>We stood facing each other in a tense silence. I wonder now if I should
have told Detective Ronnie Camberwell how important she was to me.
Maybe I should have embraced her, kissed her, twisted myself around
her. I did none of these things. Part of my genderless engineering
causes me to reflexively defer to a gendered being. I have to
consciously work to overcome that preprogrammed behavior. I can do it
readily in business negotiations. I am far less likely to do it in
personal interactions. I am no good at it at all in romantic settings.
I have no instincts at all in this regard. They have been removed.</p>
<p>The genetic engineers meant this to be a mercy. Genderless Members of
the Race have no sexual attractions to other Members of the Race. We
do not physically desire anyone else. As a result, I was not
predisposed to fight for my position as Detective Ronnie Camberwell’s
lover. I simply acquiesced.</p>
<p>“Five more days until the spaceship comes,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell finally said.</p>
<p>Good. Detective Ronnie Camberwell would not pursue her questions about
where I had been. I did not want to share my still nebulous ideas
about this place.</p>
<p>I said, “I am going to prowl around just a little bit more.”</p>
<p>I started to walk away.</p>
<p>“Can I come with you?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.</p>
<p>My heart started beating a little faster. Maybe Detective Ronnie
Camberwell wanted to be with me after all.</p>
<p>Then Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, “I just can’t sleep tonight.”</p>
<p>I said, “I will need to go back to my ride soon.”</p>
<p>“Why? You’re not leaving, are you?”</p>
<p>“No,” i said. “The mini AI can only maintain my boo-systems for so
long. I need Christabel to realign everything.”</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, “Then you’ll come back.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “if you want me to.”</p>
<p>“Of course I want you to.”</p>
<p>I became filled with joy.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be marooned here on this planet. It gives me the
creeps. Besides, the contract states I need to see Suri onto the
spaceship and then I’m free to leave. Passage on the spaceship is not
included in the contract.”</p>
<p>Just as quickly I  felt very disappointed. I was only the backup plan.</p>
<p>We walked more in silence.</p>
<p>“Is there something wrong, Star?”</p>
<p>The question was absurd. I did not laugh. Members of the Race rarely
laugh. Terries think my laugh is quite hilarious.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “There is nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>We walked a little farther.</p>
<p>“I’m getting cold,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “I think I’ll go
back.”</p>
<p>We had just passed a structure which looked fairly in tact.</p>
<p>“I want to stop here and look inside,” I said.</p>
<p>“If you wish. I’ll start back,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.</p>
<p>Should I have asked her to look inside with me? Would that have
changed anything? I do not know. Perhaps. Perhaps not.</p>
<p>The structure was almost perfect. A few stones had fallen from the
ceiling. I played my torch over the mural. And there they were:
figures that looked just like Prince Hat. According to the Terries,
these beings looked like great white bears. They were quite big. They
were the race that had fostered the growth of the Featherote, the
Fungusians, the Members of the Race and, yes, the Trollolu.
Apparently, they had fostered other unfamiliar races. I saw them in
this mural walking with all the figures I had seen before in all the
other structures. I walked through one of the doorways. My torchlight
picked out shiny circles and squares. They reminded me of the crystals
that contained lectures by the Trollolu. I had the DNA to unlock
those. Touching these did nothing. They either were not the same or
they did not respond to my touch. If they were the same sort of
device, these structures might have been schools or museums or some
other place for recording information or teaching it. Maybe this was a
library.</p>
<p>Feeling I had accomplished something, I returned to the dormitory. If
Detective Ronnie Camberwell was awake, she did not say anything.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>Diary entries should go here. Ronnie writes about her
desire for Suri Iglesia and her conflicted feelings
toward Captain Star Runner. If only Captain Star
Runner would protest, Ronnie would be able to resist
Suri Iglesia’s appeal. However, Ronnie knows it is
not possible for Star Runner to make such a strong
personal declaration. Knowing this is not sufficient
for Ronnie. She needs Star Runner to do something.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>I am writing way too many notes to self and not
enough writing. I am hopeful that these notes spark
the writing of the tale, the parts that have energy.
Recently I heard a talk where someone mentioned that
all relationships have three parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Good.</p></li>
<li><p>Rut.</p></li>
<li><p>Transition.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Star Runner and Ronnie, they have good periods.
Then they fall into a rut. Then they are vulnerable
to a transition which for them usually means breaking
apart. Once apart, they get back together and it is
good again. At some point they need to recognize
their pattern and find a way to transition out of
their get together, fall into a rut, break apart
pattern. Perhaps this is the book. Then again, there
are story arc possibilities if they break up because
they can get back together again. I do not foresee
them breaking up so completely that they never get
back again. Sometimes I think it is my failing as the
author that I cannot keep them together happily. But
also as the author, I think it is their nature to not
maintain their relationship. Star Runner’s
relationships with other characters are subject to
this same back and forth, but because Star Runner is
not always with them the breakup is dictated by time
and distance rather than affection and trust. Star
Runner and Ronnie have a lot of problems with trust.
Affection is not one of their problems. Trust is a
major issue in their lives and between them. This
adventure finally demonstrates this to me. I have
been groping for several years now. Now I get it.</p>

<h2>Captain Star Runner Narrates<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although time consuming, getting back to my ride and Christabel was
straight forward. I made a mental note to confer with the robot
concierge on my return. I wondered if the robot concierge could give
me more information about the Valley of the Incredible Vista River if
I asked direct questions. Maybe if I even asked, “Who built this
place?” I might get an answer. I did not want to stop and ask my
questions because it was becoming increasingly clear to me my
bio-systems were degrading rapidly. I had barely enough strength to
make it down the mountainside in the funicular. Christabel sent one of
the stevedore robots to collect me at the funicular railway station.
It was humiliating to be carried in this manner but since no one was
around, I submitted as gracefully as I could manage to the indignity
of it all. With a gasp I lay on my command pedestal and let the
swirling fuchsia mists of connection and healing envelop me. I slept.</p>
<p>When I awakened, much refreshed and feeling finally like myself again,
I began reviewing all the data Christabel had assembled. There was
quite a lot of it.</p>
<p>Christabel had organized all the data I recorded in the mini AI.
Christabel enhanced my recordings from the stone structures.
Christabel agreed with my quick analysis as to the subject of the
murals.</p>
<p>Christabel had access to a great wealth of ancient Fungusian records.
Most of these were marked unreliable. The Fungusian Network had
included them in Christabel’s data stores because of my encounters
with both the Followers of the Stars and the People of the Rainbow
Sky. Since these were very old races, the Fungusian Network thought
their ancient records might be helpful and there might be an
opportunity to correct them and distinguish between truth, rumor and
myth.</p>
<p>“It appears,” Christabel said, “that you have identified one more race
from the ancient archives.”</p>
<p>Christabel showed me my video of one of the murals.</p>
<p>“As the other races you identified are real;–the Trollolu, the
featherote, the Fungusian Network and the Members of the Race–I can
only infer that this new race is real also.”</p>
<p>I waited for Christabel to explain.Christabel retrieved the data
ordered in a way I could quickly absorb it. All the data was now part
of my memory structure.</p>
<p>Because I share mind space with Christabel, memory structure is very
important. I need to just know information. Christabel downgrades a
series of memories and upgrades others. When these memories are no
longer needed for immediate recall, they are downgraded again. I do
not need an elaborate memory palace to retrieve this information in
its correct order and detail. Christabel does all that work for me.</p>
<p>“These are the Tigerfu,” Christabel began. Her narration flowed
through my mind as the video passed across my visual display. Ride
status and my bio readings also were updated vertically at the edges
of my vision.</p>
<p>“As you can see, the Tigerfu bear a slight resemblance to the Members
of the Race, that is, they appear slightly feline. The resemblance,
however, is entirely superficial and most strongly in the facial
features. The Tigerfu have erect ears and whiskers. The shape of the
muzzle is similar, too. Unlike Members of the Race, Tigerfu have two
sets of arms and one set of legs. One set of arms have paws while the
other set has hands similar to those of humanoids. Their bodies are
not covered by fur. The spots are colorations of the skin and vary
from individual to individual. They have vestigial tails. These tails
seem to no longer have any purpose for balance. They do seem to play a
part in courtship and sexual foreplay. I can show you several very
grainy videos of female Tigerfu dancing and wiggling their tails. From
the male audience response, it appears this behavior arouses them.
From catcalls and rude language in my files, touching and biting tails
during foreplay increases arousal.”</p>
<p>I added a note to a file to review these videos for my pornographic
database. They could make a tidy sum. I also wanted to explore these
possibilities for my own pleasure. Christabel said there were examples
of erotic poetry to help us construct a credible scenario and
stimulate pleasure centers for the genderless population which
subscribed to my database.</p>
<p>“But let us not get distracted,” Christabel said. “There is much more
information I have to share.”</p>
<p>Christabel refocused my attention. Then Christabel dropped the bombshell.</p>
<p>“The Tigerfu were native to Planet X.”</p>
<p>“Where are they now?” I asked.</p>
<p>“As far as any records indicate, they are extinct like the Trollolu.”</p>
<p>“How?” I asked, a number of questions coming to the forefront of my
mind.</p>
<p>Christabel  read them all and said, “Be patient and I will explain
again in narrative form as I have assembled the information. You will
understand it better if I first tell you the story as I have pieced it
together and then make all the details available to you in memory.
There are gaps in the story so some of what I am about to say is
conjecture on my part. However, I think my speculations are credible
and are marked as such. I will revise when I receive or can discover
more information.”</p>
<p>I felt myself relax. Christabel gave me a mild chemical to reduce my
impatience while increasing my receptiveness to new material.</p>
<p>“The Tigerfu are the only intelligent life form to develop on
Planet X. They called the planet after themselves, Tigerfu Land. They
developed space flight and expanded rapidly in this sector, dominating
all intelligent or developing intelligence beings and their worlds.
Although not particularly despotic, they controlled their conquered
worlds absolutely.</p>
<p>“Then they encountered the Followers of the Stars. The Followers of
the Stars had been watching the Tigerfu closely and were displeased by
their absolute conquest of developing races. They intervened and
pushed the Tigerfu back to their own home world, divesting them of
their nascent empire. The Tigerfu rebelled.</p>
<p>“As you know,, the Followers of the Stars are a frightful people. They
do not Brook any behavior that questions their authority. They again
pushed the Tigerfu out of space and monitored Tigerfu activities on
Tigerfu Land very closely. The communications satellites that monitor
the planet were originally set in place for this purpose.</p>
<p>“The Tigerfu were extremely angry at the high-handed nature of the
Followers of the Stars’ actions. They sought again to rebel. This time
the Followers of the Stars annihilated them.”</p>
<p>“Did not Prince Hat say that they made a mistake with the Trollolu?” I
asked. “Was that before or after this genocide?”</p>
<p>“That is hard to tell. We may need to face the reality that Prince Hat
may not be a fully reliable source.”</p>
<p>“I liked him,” I said.</p>
<p>“Your race was once pets of the Followers of the Stars. You are
predisposed to like them and be compliant toward them. The Tigerfu
were independent. The Followers of the Stars did not like what they
did to other peoples.”</p>
<p>“What about the structures here?” I asked. “Why is this considered a
sacred place?”</p>
<p>“I have hacked into the communication satellites and talked with the
robot concierge at Hotel Vista Incredible,” Christabel said. “The
robot concierge is a wealth of information and gave me access to all
databases except for those that would compromise any of the workings
of Planet X. Here’s what I know.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>All the stone structures in the valley were made to last. Those
on the River Walk were for entertainment and were not made to
last. They have fallen into disrepair. The stone structures are,
as you surmised, a monument to the accomplishments of the White
Bear Union. The White Bear Union consists of the Followers of
the Stars and all the races they controlled at the height of
their power. This would include the Tigerfu, the Trollolu, the
Featherote Charm, The Fungusian Network and the Members of the
Race. It also included several other races which the robot
concierge identified but for which I have no images and no
history. We have either not encountered them yet, they have
changed dramatically in the many millennia that have passed or
they are extinct or have left the Primary Arm.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“The robot staff can maintain the function of the transportation
system. They were not given the wherewithal to maintain the
structures in the valley. They can also repair the communications
satellites.”</p>
<p>“What about the stories of the civilization that used to live here a
few thousand years ago?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That is a rumor only. The robot concierge called it propaganda put
out by a rival race but the robot concierge did not know which one but
suggested it could be a rival to the Followers of the Stars. This
seems likely to me.”</p>
<p>“Are there any weapons here?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not that I am aware of,,” Christabel replied. “You of course are no
threat as you are, in the robot concierge’s opinion, a member of the
White Bear Union. The robot concierge is uncertain about Detective
Ronnie Camberwell since she is from an unknown race, but as she came
with you, she is under your protection for now. The robot concierge is
concerned about Suri Iglesia and was concerned by Heracles Beja. Their
tests in the valley have been noted and logged. So long as they do not
deface anything, the robot concierge is willing to leave Suri Iglesia
alone. All of your activity is logged and these logs are regularly
transmitted to the communications satellites.”</p>
<p>“What happens to them there. Surely they would have run out of storage
by now,” I said.</p>
<p>“The logs continue to be transmitted,” Christabel said. “What is even
more interesting is that the robot concierge receives regular updates.
Stellar drift would have been a serious problem over the millennia,
but corrections continue to be processed and software updates come
through on a regular basis.”</p>
<p>“How were you able to hack into them?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That is an easy one. The Fungusian Network developed the original
software. Any updates have followed a similar development cycle. I
have patched some vulnerabilities while adding back doors for the
Fungusian Network and myself. I have added the divergent code basis to
my programming libraries and transmitted this information back to the
Fungusian Network. I anticipate a lively discussion once the
networking historians review the code. I must confess to being very
pleased with myself.”</p>
<p>I felt Christabel glow. All her pathways seem to sparkle. It gave me a
warm and tingly feeling which I like very much.</p>
<p>We were quiet for a bit, enjoying feelings of success and intimacy.</p>
<p>“What is the relationship between the Followers of the Stars and the
Lystran Empire?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Uneasy,” Christabel replied promptly. “There has traditionally been
a stalemate between them. Now that the Lystran Empire is called the
Sick Man of the Primary Arm, I do not know. The Followers of the Stars
have retreated from the galactic scene. This leaves the People of the
Rainbow Sky in charge, but their authority is being questioned by the
People of the Golden Sun. Although they call themselves a people, as
you know, they are more a conglomeration of lesser races who are
questioning the supremacy of the older empires.”</p>
<p>“But the robot concierge is not willing to move against Suri Iglesia.
Does the robot concierge know Suri Iglesia killed Heracles Beja?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Christabel said. “There are recordings.”</p>
<p>“Then we can show them to Detective Ronnie Camberwell.” I was excited
by this possibility.</p>
<p>“Detective Ronnie Camberwell will not believe them if she does not
want to believe them,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>“Why not? It is incontrovertible proof,” I said.</p>
<p>“To you,” Christabel said, “but Detective Ronnie Camberwell could
easily claim I invented these videos.”</p>
<p>Christabel was right. A video would not convince Detective Ronnie
Camberwell if she did not want to be convinced. Based on what I had
observed, Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not want to be convinced.</p>
<p>“Is Detective Ronnie Camberwell all right?” I asked. “Can you tell?”</p>
<p>“There are security cameras still functioning in the valley,”
Christabel said. “She is fine and enjoying sexual encounters with Suri
Iglesia in your absence. They liked it when you left the dormitory,
but were always anxious when you would return.”</p>
<p>“And I thought I was sneaking away unnoticed,” I said. I was heartsick
at this news and crestfallen that I had been found out.</p>
<p>“Do not be upset,” Christabel soothed as she pumped more relaxing
chemicals into my body. “This too shall pass.”</p>
<p>Christabel may have been certain Detective Ronnie Camberwell’s
infatuation would pass, but I was not. We seemed to be drifting apart
even before we came to Tigerfu Land. I remembered to tell Christabel
to block the Tigerfu from my conversations with Detective Ronnie
Camberwell. I did not want Suri Iglesia to know.</p>

<p>Totally refreshed, I ascended the mountainside on the funicular. This
time I looked about me. The terrain was bleak. Despite the centuries
that had passed since the Followers of the Stars frequented Tigerfu
Land, plant life was still quite un-evolved. I wondered if the
destruction of the Tigerfu stripped these mountains of forests and the
animals they supported. The views were astonishing but the lushness of
growth or the occasional large wild animal was totally absent. It gave
Planet X a sense of unreality as if it was a poorly executed stage
set.</p>
<p>A stage set? Was that what Planet X had become? Christabel and I
considered this for a time. If the only two habitable sites left on
the planet were the Hotel Vista Incredible and the valley below it,
then it was a kind of video set. The funicular played right into that
sensibility. Other visitors to the planet would have experienced it
just as Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I had. It was part amusement
park ride, part grand hotel, part riverside holiday. I must take the
time to tour the Hotel Vista Incredible facility. Had any other
Members of the Race visited here?</p>
<p>Although the robot concierge had given Christabel a lot of
information, the more questions I asked, the more apparent it became
that the robot concierge had kept back a great deal of data. We began
developing a list of questions for me to ask as the funicular climbed
up the mountain. The more we studied the mountain, the more artificial
it looked. The growth was far too regular to be natural. I wondered at
the scale of the destruction and the subsequent construction. What
were the Followers of the Stars up to here?</p>
<div class="section" id="excursus">
<h2>EXCURSUS<a class="headerlink" href="#excursus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have only met one member of the race calling itself Followers of the
Stars. I call him Prince Hat. To oversimplify, Prince Hat looks like a
brown bear. I do not know if the right size is large, average or
small. Prince Hat is larger than a Terry.</p>
<p>Prince Hat told us a tale of the western spiral arm tens of thousands
of years ago. One of the points Prince Hat made was that the Followers
of the Stars had committed genocide against the Trollolu because the
Trollolu had sought to question the the right of the Followers of the
Stars to rule the western spiral arm. Prince Hat spoke of this
incident with great sorrow and remorse.</p>
<p>Now Christabel and I had learned that the Followers of the Stars had
also committed genocide against the Tigerfu for the same sort of
offense. I have been to the Landscape of Thorns. I know about the the
toxic chemical wasteland there. Was there a similar wasteland here on
Planet X? Is that why there were rumors of ghosts or strange
happenings here? Nothing strange had happened here unless you wanted
to count Heracles Beja’s death. I thought Heracles Beja’s death was
fairly straight forward. Suri Iglesia killed him for her own reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="end-of-excursus">
<h2>End of Excursus<a class="headerlink" href="#end-of-excursus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I went to the desk in the lobby of the Hotel Vista Incredible and rang
the bell with the printed sign: PLEASE RING FOR SERVICE. The robot
concierge appeared.</p>
<p>“How may I help you, Captain Star Runner?”</p>
<p>“I have some questions about the Followers of the Star,,” I said.</p>
<p>“Very well,” the robot concierge said.</p>
<p>“Did the Followers of the Stars commit genocide against the Tigerfu
before or after they committed genocide against the Trollolu?”</p>
<p>“An interesting question,” the robot concierge said. “I like
interesting questions. It has been a long time since someone asked me
an interesting question.”</p>
<p>I waited for an answer. None came.</p>
<p>“You are not answering my question,” I said.</p>
<p>“I cannot answer your question,” the robot concierge said. “It is not
a rightly formed question.”</p>
<p>I thought about it. The artificial intelligences I have dealt with
have reframed my questions in order to supply me with an answer.
Apparently the robot concierge could not or would not do the same.</p>
<p>“What is wrong with my question?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Its parts do not add up to a whole,” the robot concierge said. “One
of the failsafes in my programming is to not suggest an answer to a
poorly formed question. This avoids confusion.”</p>
<p>“Let me try this series of questions then,” I said.</p>
<p>“Did the Followers of the Stars commit genocide against the Trollolu?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the robot concierge said. “This has caused great sadness and
remorse.”</p>
<p>This was consistent with what Prince Hat had already told me.</p>
<p>“Did the Followers of the Stars commit genocide against the Tigerfu??”</p>
<p>“No,” the robot concierge said.</p>
<p>“You gave my artificial intelligence, Christabel, data which said that
genocide against the Tigerfu was committed,” I said.</p>
<p>“No, I did not. Your artificial intelligence, Christabel, inferred
that meaning. The data I gave your artificial intelligence,
Christabel, stated that all the Tigerfu on this planet were
destroyed.”</p>
<p>“What happened to the rest of the Tigerfu that were not on the
planet?” I asked.</p>
<p>“They were removed to a far distant area of the Primary Arm,” the
robot concierge said.</p>
<p>“Did this removal happen before or after the Trollolu genocide?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“After,” the robot concierge said. “The Followers of the Stars did not
want to commit genocide against.”</p>
<p>“And was there sufficient numbers of the Tigerfu for them to rebuild
their race?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The Followers of the Stars believed there was,” the robot concierge
said.</p>
<p>So the Tigerfu were still out there. I was fairly confident of that.</p>
<p>“And is there a toxic chemical wasteland here on Planet X from that
conflict?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, there is,” the robot concierge said. “It is located on the other
side of the planet, far from this place.”</p>
<p>“And what is the purpose of the Hotel Vista Incredible, the valley
structures and this whole place?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It serves two purposes,” the robot concierge said. “First, it
provides, or provided, educational displays for the young people. They
were entertained when they came here, but they also learned the
history of interacting with other races.</p>
<p>“Second, the area acts as a cover story for Planet X. The ghost
stories and strangeness of the place and its fake history of an
ancient (although it is not really ancient) civilization hides the
toxic chemical bunkers and the history of the Tigerfu who have been
forgotten.”</p>
<p>I doubted the Tigerfu were completely forgotten. The People of the
Rainbow Sky would certainly know about them. I wondered if I could ask
Sam Lam Seah about it. I would have to think about that.</p>
<p>“Do you send regular reports to the Followers of the Stars concerning
visitors to Planet X?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Have you sent a report about the death of Heracles Beja?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“And on the dating of the Trollolu mural down in the valley?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>
<p>“Have you received any responses to your reports?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” the robot concierge said.</p>
<p>“When was the last response you received from any report you sent?” I
asked. I hoped this was a telling question. I hoped it would tell me
something about the activity of the Followers of the Stars.</p>
<p>“I received a report seven thousand, six hundred and fifty-two days
ago, presented in local time,” the robot concierge said.</p>
<p>The answer surprised me.</p>
<p>“And you have been working here all that time alone?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I am not alone here,” the robot concierge said.</p>
<p>“Who is with you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There is a whole contingent of maintenance robots,” the robot
concierge said, “hotel staff including pleasure robots. Would you like
to engage a pleasure robot, Captain Star Runner? Use of a pleasure
robot is included in the charge for your suite.”</p>
<p>I knew both that the robot concierge was diverting my rather pointed
questions, but I also knew that a pleasure robot would answer many of
my questions.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Please have the pleasure robot meet me in my suite.”</p>
<p>“Specify model,” the robot concierge said.</p>
<p>“What are my choices?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Followers of the Stars, Trollolu, Featherote, humanoid, Pantheran or Tigerfu.”</p>
<p>I was stunned. There was a pleasure robot designed to be a Member of
the Race? Christabel and I had a private chuckle that the Fungusian
network was not represented.</p>
<p>Later I learned several other races were available, but as neither
Christabel nor I knew of their existence, they were not included in
the list.</p>
<p>I will  not detail my experiences with the pleasure robot. They are
recorded in my pornographic database and can be purchased by any
reader who wants to recreate my exploits. However, what I will say in
the context of this adventure is this: I chose a Tigerfu pleasure
robot instead of a Followers of the Stars model. I am curious, but I
was not sure I would enjoy a bear-like creature. If I am honest, and
you, dear reader know I endeavor to be honest in recounting my
adventures, I am still in awe of the Followers of the Stars because of
our ancient history with them. the Tigerfu tail is covered
with feathers. This quite surprised and delighted me. I find the
texture and touch of feathers very pleasant.</p>
<p>It was too late in the day to travel to the valley. Christabel said
everything was normal there. I would travel back to the valley in the
morning. For now, I had some serious thinking to do which would be
hard work as Christabel and I needed to work through the mini AI. This
meant my thinking band width was quite limited. It sometimes made me
feel stupid. Thankfully, Christabel did many things to encourage me
and to keep me processing all the information I received today.</p>
<p>Based on what I learned from Sam Lam Seah of the People of the Rainbow
Sky in <em>Sanctuary, Nanowrimo 2011</em>, I did not believe the Followers of
the Stars had any outposts in the Primary Arm. Now I had learned they
controlled Planet X, if only in absentia, and that they had played a
major role in this part of the galaxy. My encounter with the People of
the Golden sun made me very aware that that the primary arm was not a
peaceful place. Skirmishes continued to occur in different sectors.
Near here a war was building. Perhaps it had already broken out.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Could he Tigerfu be behind the renegade People of the Golden Sun?</p></li>
<li><p>Were the Followers of the Stars capable of responding?</p></li>
<li><p>Where did the Lystrans fit in?</p></li>
<li><p>Would the People of the Rainbow Sky continue to be able to resist
the People of the Golden Sun?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“You know,” Christabel said, “The name People of the Golden Sun is
interesting.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We thought it was a play on the People of the Rainbow Sky.”</p>
<p>“That is true,” I said. “That is what the People of the Rainbow Sky
told us.”</p>
<p>“They may believe it,,” Christabel said. “But here is the thing: The
Golden Sun is the opposite of the stars. The sun shines during the
day. The stars come out at night as people on a planet experience it.</p>
<p>“The People of the Rainbow Sky and the Followers of the Stars were
great allies once. We know this. The People of the Rainbow Sky were
able to modify your genetic engineering and upgrade both you and me.”</p>
<p>“This is getting very complicated,” I said. “Something tells me the
Followers of the Stars have read all the logs the robot concierge has
sent. There has been no need to respond up until this point. But with
Suri Iglesia’s discovery–even if Suri Iglesia herself does not fully
grasp its meaning–much will be revealed that the old races would
rather not be known.”</p>
<p>“And if the Tigerfu are really behind the People of the Golden Sun,
they have waited a very long time for their revenge.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “they have waited a very long time. What is that Terry
saying about revenge?”</p>
<p>“Revenge is a dish best served cold,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>“We need to be very careful,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes, we do,” Christabel said. “I think we need to leave here as soon
as possible.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” I said. “The faster I am back at Half Moon Bay Station the
better I will like it.”  be part of it?</p>

<p>I paid close attention as I traveled back to where Suri Iglesia was
working. Christabel and I worked together via the mini AI.</p>

<li><p>I must add the name of the valley into all references to it. Captain Star Runner would never use a general

</div>
<p>Christabel brought up her images of the planet and I fed her data from
the ground. This part of Planet X was carefully designed, making use
of existing waterways and mountains. No wonder this area had been
dubbed Vista Incredible. It had been especially designed to be an
incredible view of the so-called natural world.</p>
<p>I am no expert on these matters, of course. The great open spaces and
the encircling mountains made me quite uncomfortable. Christabel had
supplied the mini AI with sufficient biochemicals to keep my anxiety
levels low, allowing me to cultivate an appreciation for the work the
Followers of the Stars had done here.</p>
<p>I did not find Suri Iglesia and Detective Ronnie Camberwell at the
Trollolu stone structure. Before I panicked, I checked the dormitory
building and its makeshift laboratory. Suri Iglesia was packing up her
supplies.</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell was saying, “Suri, I don’t think this is a
good idea. Your family is expecting you to be aboard the ship they are
sending here.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Suri Iglesia said. “I will see to it that you receive
the full amount of your fee. I know your contract is fulfilled when
you turn me over to the captain. I know what I am doing.”</p>
<p>I stood in the doorway. Both women turned toward me.</p>
<p>“There you are,” Suri Iglesia said. “What took you so long? I thought
you would never come back.”</p>
<p>I did not say anything. The length of my absence was no concerns of
hers.</p>
<p>“I would like to book passage on your spaceship for Transfer Point
Seventeen. You will be paid well if you take me there right away and
get there as quickly as possible. How long would that take?”</p>
<p>“Identify Transfer Point Seventeen,” I said.</p>
<p>“It is in Lystran Empire, stupid cat,” Suri Iglesia said. Her tone was
both dismissive and impatient. “Everyone knows Transfer Point
Seventeen.”</p>
<p>I decided not to point out to Suri Iglesia the stupidity of her
remark. Everyone does not know the stellar cartography of the Lystran
Empire.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Christabel was prepared. Using conventional insertion and
extraction points, the space journey would take twenty-seven days.
Christabel and I suspected I could do it much faster.</p>
<p>I have learned a good deal about bargaining so I said, “That will take
twenty-seven standard days. If I get there sooner, I will expect a
bonus for every day I get you there sooner.” I named my price and my
bonus. Both were high. I expected Suri Iglesia to balk at the price
and name her own.</p>
<p>Instead Suri Iglesia said, “That will be acceptable.”</p>
<p>Suri Iglesia signed the contract and gave me the full fare. I simply
would not let her off my ride until I received my bonus. That usually
worked and if Suri Iglesia protested, arbitration boards usually ruled
in favor of the captain.</p>
<p>Suri Iglesia said Detective Ronnie Camberwell would receive her fee</p>
<p>when we all boarded my ride.The journey back was uneventful. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
sullen. Suri Iglesia was impatient.I suspected, and this was later
confirmed,that her manner aboard my ride was imperious. This would not
be a real problem. I could keep Suri Iglesia out of my control center.</p>
<p>The space ways were governed by a number of rules. One rule was that
the captain was in charge. Suri Iglesia would not be able to command
to do her bidding. I simply refused and ignored her.</p>
<p>I was glad to leave Planet X and get back into space. Traveling
through Mother Space is my favorite state of being.</p>

<p>Suri Iglesia and I were well aware of Captain Star Runner’s forays
into the night. Where Star Runner went and what Star Runner did we did
not know. Suri’s opinion was neither of us needed to know. She
basically thought Star Runner was a smelly, not too bright alien and
any time we could be separated from her was a good time.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>I was definitely attracted to Suri, but as I spent more time with her,
I found her to be a bigoted, self-absorbed and narcissistic woman.
She was a demanding sex partner and, in her self-referential way, she
was not at all concerned about my satisfaction or my feelings.</p>
<p>For example, one time she said, “Well, for a big woman you don’t have
much in the way of voluptuousness. You might as well be a man. At
least then you could penetrate me.” I thought that was the point. No
penetration was necessary.</p>
</div>
<p>When Suri started packing up her things, I became agitated. I did not
want to forfeit my fee. When I raised this question with her, Suri
snapped at me.</p>
<p>“You’ll get your fee. Don’t be so money grubbing. You’re talking just
like a man.”</p>
<p>I am worth my fee. I could not protect Heracles Beja, but nothing
untoward had happened to Suri. It was Suri’s family who had hired me.</p>
<p>Suri Iglesia’s personality had changed greatly since I first met her.
The frightened girl had become arrogant.</p>

<p>Show do not tell. Give examples.</p>
</div>
<p>I was in quite a pickle when I boarded Captain Star Runner’s ride. I
knew the signs. Captain Star Runner had retreated into herself. She
would block herself off from us during the trip through Mother Space.</p>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h3>Excursus<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mother Space is the Pantheran word (In Pantheran it is one word) for
hyperspace. It is called Mother Space because the Pantherans believe
the Mother of Us All showed Pantherans of old how to go in and out of
hyperspace. The Mother of Us All is both a deity and a constellation
visible from Panthera, the Pantheran home world. Pantherans also
believe that the Mother of Us All look after them and so long as they
can see any star in her constellation, they will be safe.</p>
<p>This is
especially true of space faring Pantherans. I once asked Captain Star
Runner what Pantherans did when they traveled out of sight of the
constellation’s stars.</p>
<p>“We know where the constellation is,” Captain Star Runner replied.
“That is all that matters. And when we are in Mother Space, we are
near the Mother.”</p>
<p>This made no sense to me. What I do know that as simplistic as this
belief system sounds, the Pantherans know that the constellation is
not the deity. The Mother of Us All stands for their collective
identity and is a foundational myth of their race. The Mother of Us
All is the race and they are therefore a part of her.</p>
<p>The Mother of us All constellation looks like a Pantheran. You can get
a sense of the nose, ears, whiskers, paws, back and tail. The tail
stands high. The Mother of Us All is prancing through the heavens. It
must be a breathtaking sight from Panthera. Other stars form the
Mother’s cape. Some have even identified several juveniles which
surround the Mother. The Mother of Us All is a sprawling
constellation.</p>
<p>Star runners are specially genetically engineered Pantherans who pilot
spaceships. They can sense where to enter and leave hyperspace. Other
races build jump gates for this. All traffic comes and goes through
these gates. They are chartered and spaceships must travel between
these specific jump gates in hyperspace or get lost forever. Star
runners just know where points exist and travel freely through
hyperspace.</p>
<p>I have been told that Captain Star Runner is particularly gifted
finding insertion and extraction points. I was confident we would
arrive at Transfer Point Seventeen well ahead of the twenty-seven day
standard run even though Star Runner had never been to Lystran space.
I knew the Space Traders Guild was in awe of Captain Star Runner’s
ability to make quick runs. Her ship was  not particularly well-suited
for transport of either goods or passengers. It was a People of the
Rainbow Sky military vehicle, but Star Runner had made some
adjustments and put it to good use. It was a fast vessel and most of
Star Runner’s business was getting people or small amounts of goods
quickly from here to there. Despite the wide use of self-manufactured
parts and self-assembling parts, it is still necessary to ferry goods
from one place to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h3>End of Excursus<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although Star Runner had to move very slowly to approach Transfer
Point Seventeen after extraction from hyperspace, she did still
accomplish the run in nineteen days. The bonus Star Runner constructed
and Suri Iglesia accepted paid off handsomely as Star Runner
anticipated. She was quite pleased with herself. Suri Iglesia was
furious at the high cost because, as she said, the ride had not been
up to her standards being smelly, without servant robots and poor
meals. The truth of the matter is that the spaceship has Star Runner’s
scent. It is not a luxury liner with chefs, wait staff and
entertainment. The meals were adequate and the accommodations are not
bad. We were not confined to our staterooms. There is a pleasant
lounge with a variety of entertainments. Star Runner has paid
attention to passenger needs fairly well. Lystran specialties were
absent but this was Star Runner’s first trip to Lystra and there had
been no time to prepare.</p>
<p>I was glad to see Suri Iglesia leave the spaceship. Her constant
whining and complaining drove me into my stateroom for hours at a
time. Star Runner had cut herself off from us. I found Christabel
unbearable. Her artificial voice always sounds smug to me.</p>
<p>When new supplies came aboard the spaceship I expected we would be on
our way back to Half Moon Bay Space Station quickly. But nothing
happened. A day went by and then two. No goods came aboard ship. Was
Captain Star Runner having trouble getting a return cargo? This seemed
very odd to me. With her speed, Captain Star Runner would be a good
choice. Transfer points are jump gate hubs where regular spaceships
can find their way to various other points in the galactic arm. There
are a lot of cargoes changing hands.</p>
<p>Finally I went to the control room door. Captain Star Runner was
grooming.</p>
<p>“Will we be leaving soon?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Captain tar Runner paused her licking to speak.</p>
<p>“No? Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We cannot leave,” Captain Star Runner said, resuming her grooming.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked again. This sounded strange.</p>
<p>“War has broken out in this sector,” Christabel explained. The Lystran
Empire has joined the conflict. We have been classified as an
unfriendly vessel and so we cannot leave. Not only do we not have
permission to leave, we would come under fire if we tried.”</p>
<p>“So we’re stuck here?” I asked. “How could that have happened?”</p>
<p>“We could not have anticipated Lystra joining the conflict,”
Christabel said. “Lystra has come into the conflict as a supporter of
the People of the Golden Sun. Since this ride is a People of the
Rainbow Sky military vessel, although it is no longer owned and
operated by them, we are lucky that it has not yet been seized. Nor
have we been imprisoned. At the moment, we have appealed our status
and are trying to get permission to proceed to a neutral location
outside of the sector. So far, a neutral site has not been agreed
upon.”</p>
<p>“How long will this take?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We do not know,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>I was about to ask if we were in any danger. Then I remembered
Christabel said we were not imprisoned and the ship had not been
confiscated as a war prize. Well, this adventure of mine that I
thought would be profitable was certainly turning out to be a
nightmare instead.</p>
<p>Disconsolate, I returned to my stateroom. How could I make good use of
my time now that it looked like we could be marooned here for a long
time?</p>

<p>Today is the midpoint of Nanowrimo. By the end of the day, to be on
track, I should have twenty-five thousand words. I will not. However,
I have moved the story on and discovered new things. I like it that I
tell myself a story during nanowrimo and the story tells me many new
and wonderful things, too. The two most interesting things to come out
of the writing so far are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The villain of the piece thus far turned out to be Suri Iglesia and
not Heracles Beja. This may change over time–in fact, I am getting
a hint that it will.</p></li>
<li><p>The Tigerfu have revealed themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The ancient races have shown up in the murals on the walls of the
stone structures. Who knew.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I am trying to figure out the fifty per cent mark. There should be a
sense that things have turned bad. OK, I already have Captain Star
runner and Detective Ronnie Camberwell at odds. They are stuck behind
enemy lines. Ronnie just wants to get home and get on with her life
such as it is. Captain Star Runner wants to keep making money. They
are united in their desire too leave but not as a couple.</p>
<p>What am I going to do for the next thirty thousand words?</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Chapter Twelve: Visitors Come Aboard Captain Star Runner’s Ride</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-twelve-visitors-come-aboard-captain-star-runner-s-ride" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h2>Ronnie Narrates<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Life aboard the ride fell into a soul-chilling pattern. I made myself
dress every day. I ate regular meals. I exercised. I tried to find
something meaningful to do. There was very little meaningful work for
me to do since the ride bots maintained the spaceship. Captain Star
Runner moved about the ride from time to time but avoided me whenever
possible. We spoke hardly at all. Whatever head games Star and
Christabel played, I was not invited to share in them.</p>
<p>One of the rules of our confinement was that we could not leave the
ride. If we did, we could not get aboard it again. If I left to wander
the Transfer Point, I could not resume my place aboard it.
Effectively, I believed, I would never get back to Half Moon Bay Space
Station. I did not think I could survive that. If other Lystrans were
like Suri Iglesia, they would be insufferable and I would be a second
class person at best and possibly even lower on the social strata. I
had no idea if I could find work and how I could support myself. At
least aboard Captain Star Runner’s ride, I was free to move about and
there was no lack of food, comfortable shelter and, for that matter,
air. There was an air tax on Half Moon Bay Station. Failure to pay it
was a serious offense. People went into servitude if they could not
pay their air tax. From what I had heard, it was virtually impossible
to get out of servitude once you were in it. People in servitude were,
for all intents and purposes, enslaved for life.</p>
<p>Given all these circumstances, i was surprised the morning I got up
late, dressed sloppily and opened my stateroom door to hear the sound
of humanoid laughter coming down the corridor from the control center.
I listened for a little while. I heard Star’s voice and another
non-humanoid speaker. This was a live conversation. These new speakers
were not Lystrans.</p>
<p>I pulled myself together to be more presentable and walked tentatively
toward the control center, pausing uncertainly in the doorway.</p>
<p>Sitting on the edge of Captain Star Runner’s command pedestal was a
who looked to be around my age and a rather large white rabbit.</p>
<p>“Hello,” the woman said, jumping up. “I am Pru Dillow. You must be
Detective Ronnie Camberwell.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said rather stupidly. Her vivacity took me aback. I was slow
to put out my hand to her. I must appear either dim-witted or very
stand-offish. I would like to think I am neither.</p>
<p>“I am Salim,” the rabbit said. He neither moved nor put out a paw.</p>
<p>Of course. These were Captain Star Runner’s companions in Sanctuary
Eleven. Star had told me about them.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to meet you both,” I said, remaining in the doorway. Pru
Dillow had returned to her seat.</p>
<p>“Are you stuck here on Transfer Point Eleven, too?” I asked. I had to
say something and <em>Captain Star Runner has told me all about you</em> did
not seem appropriate given our strained relationship. I wondered what
Star had told them  if anything. Why should I think I was uppermost in
Star Runner’s mind the way she was uppermost in mine.</p>
<p>“More or less,” Pru Dillow said.</p>
<p>“Then how are you able to come aboard?” I asked. “we were told we could not</p>
<p>leave this ‘ride’ (I used Star Runner’s designation at the last
second) without losing the ability to come aboard again.”</p>
<p>“That’s\ is because you are the operators of this vessel,” Salim
explained in his nasal basic speech. His large teeth made the words
come out as if they were accented but they were not. His basic was
flawless. “Our vessel is owned by a corporation back on a Merchant
world. Pru and I own the corporation, but its registration is not in
our names.”</p>
<p>I was startled. I did not think I was listed as an owner of Captain
Star Runner’s ride. In fact, I was sure of that fact. How had I been
lumped into her category?</p>
<p>Christabel answered my question, “Although you are not listed as an
owner, Ronnie, your status is uncertain because your race is not from
this galactic arm. As a result, you have been given the status of a
highly suspicious character. The authorities cannot tell what side you
are on.”</p>
<p>I wanted to blurt out that I was on my own side and I did not care at
all about their war. I just wanted to get back to my job and my little
cubbyhole on Half Moon Bay Station that I was coming to think of as
home. If the truth be known, I really wanted to go back to Ptolemy
City on Hypatia in the Pharaoh Star System. It was only through my
association with Captain Star Runner and his friends on the Northern
Frontier that I had left there in the first place. I should really
check and see if I could go back there when I got out of here,
whenever that would be.</p>
<p>“So you can leave any time you want?” I asked, wondering if this pair
was my means of escape.</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” Pru Dillow said. “We are stuck, too, because we want
to go into territory controlled by the People of the Rainbow Sky. They
are traditional rivals of Lystra.”</p>
<p>I held my head.</p>
<p>“All this political maneuvering is making my head ache,” I said. “I
come from an area of space in the western spiral arm that is, by
design, apolitical and free to all comers if they abide by the unrule
of law. We have our own sensibilities and you can do pretty much as
you please if you stick to only a couple of rules. After that, you are
just on your own.”</p>
<p>“Your League of Hypatian Pirates has always interested us,” Salim
said. “If the situation was different, we might even think about
visiting there. Of course I need to stay near Merchant worlds. We lost
our homeland and we are trying to build ourselves up. That means every
Rabbit person must stay involved.”</p>
<p>“How is that going?” I asked for something to say.</p>
<p>“Pretty well,” Salim said. “We have reached a critical mass so the
future of the Merchant race seems pretty well established. In another
seven generations we will have reached stability on three worlds with
only five more to go. We have been very fortunate. At first we thought
all was lost when our home world was destroyed, but we had enough
Merchant ships out of the star system with enough productive adults to
build up our numbers. The litters have been large and the survival
rate has been very good. Many of the females have nursed extra kits so
there have been no runt problems. We have found ways to have these
runts thrive. It used to be thought they were inferior, but it turns
out through careful nurturing they do very well.”</p>
<p>I did not know what to say. This sounded more like dog breeding than
the proper venue for societal stability. Well, Salim was an alien.
Their values were different.</p>
<p>“we were just discussing the war when you came in,” Pru Dillow said.</p>
<p>I was not certain of her status. I knew she and Salim had had a
relationship of sorts. I wondered if Salim had felt it necessary to
contribute to the population explosion of his kind. Did that mean he
had a wife or did the Rabbit people just mate and then go about their
lives. I could have found out, but I decided I did not need to know at
this point. If that changed, I would inquire.</p>
<p>“I scan headlines,” I said, “but I do not know how accurate the local
information is.”</p>
<p>“As it turns out,” Pru Dillow said (Did she just go by Pru or was Pru
Dillow her name. It was hard to know with Captain Star Runner’s
propensity for using someone’s entire name and honorific in
conversational speech.), “the local propaganda is mostly wrong.”</p>
<p>“how do you know that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We always talk to people from the outside when we can,” Salim
explained. “They have the latest news. They are not always right, of
course, but we have gotten the general impression that Lystra continues
to lose worlds to the People of the Golden Sun. The message the local
populations are given convinces them to revolt and once they have
ousted their Lystran overlords, they find out differently. They have
traded inefficiency and neglect for outright domination and theft of
the planet’s resources. The Lystrans are corrupt but they do not
typically strip a world of all of its resources leaving the people on
the edge of famine and societal collapse.”</p>
<p>I shivered. These sounded like very nasty people.</p>
<p>“Who will stop them?” I asked. “Don’t the worlds know how ruthless
these people are?”</p>
<p>“Ohf course they know,” Pru Dillow said. “But their choice is
capitulation or annihilation. There are examples of annihilation
throughout the primary arm. The worlds except enslavement to preserve
themselves. Lystra cannot stand against these marauders.”</p>
<p>“So if I have this right,” I said, “The People of the Golden Sun are
continuing to subsume the Lystran Empire. How close are they to
Transfer Point Seventeen?”</p>
<p>“We are fairly far away.” Captain Star Runner spoke for the first
time. She had been washing her face, a very painstaking process which
included smoothing her luxurious whiskers. In Pantheran parlances,
Captain Star Runner had very beautiful whiskers. The beauty experts
would say that the beauty of Star Runner’s face was marred by the
white star on her forehead. Pantherans preferred a solid-colored
specimen. Star, on the other hand, had the white star, four white paws
and a white-tipped tail. The white on her tail was especially frowned
upon. I had checked once. Fuchsia-colored Pantherans are extremely
rare. All known fuchsia-colored Pantherans over many millennia looked
exactly like Star Runner.</p>
<p>“I do not think we are in any immediate danger. It is a situation that
needs to be watched very carefully. I have no desire to come into
contact with anyone from the People of the Golden Sun.”</p>
<p>“But the Lystran empire will fall eventually?” I said, putting a
question mark at the end of my sentence to ensure a response.</p>
<p>“That is uncertain,” Star Runner said. “For a long time, there was a
balance of power here in the Primary Arm. That balance has been upset.
The People of the Golden Sun have conquered a lot of worlds in a
fairly short, galactically-speaking, length of time. It remains to be
seen if they can manage their conquests or if the conquered worlds
will rebel and be successful. It also remains to be seen if the older
empires and long-established cooperative will decide to stop the
People of the Golden Sun. I participated in such a military action. It
was decisive.”</p>
<p>“We just do not know if these larger groups have the will to do it,”
Salim said. I was not sure, but I thought I detected some bitterness
in his tone. “The Lystran empire’s corruption and depravity is
legendary. The People of the Rainbow Sky have also been very inwardly
focused for many millenia. It remains to be seen if they have the
general good of the primary arm still in view. They may simply protect
their own space and not worry about the rest.”</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner swished her tail, twitched her ears and resettled
herself.. What was she not saying. Surely there was more to this
situation, but I did not know the questions to ask. Had I asked them,,
things might have been different.</p>
<div class="admonition-twist admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">TWIST</p>
<p>If there was not a block, Captain Star Runner could
have shared with its friends about the Tigerfu and
the Followers of the Stars. Because of the block,
this information was withheld. I need to figure out
how this becomes a critical flaw in the story and
what consequences occur because of it.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>Let me try writing Ronnie’s next scene in the third
person. If it becomes difficult or I do not like it,
I will revert to the first person.</p>
</div>
<p>Although Pru Dillow and Salim were Captain Star Runner’s friends from
a previous adventure, Ronnie found them to be pleasant meal
companions. Even Captain Star Runner seemed less remote in their
company. Robbie began to realize that the political crisis might be
weighing heavily on the Pantheran’s mind. Captain Star Runner was
ill-equipped to handle all the complications brought about by an
interstellar conflict. Although train to be a military star runner,
Captain Star Runner had no training in political negotiations and only
a smattering of history and that about the Pantheran hegemony in the
western spiral arm. Christabel was helping where she could, but none
of us were well-versed in the local politics of the primary arm. We
all were very much out of our depth at this juncture.</p>
<p>As Ronnie looked around the table set up in the lounge, she began to
think they were all whistling in the dark because they were all
scared. She realized that Captain Star Runner’s remoteness may have
had to do with fear. As a Pantheran, even a genderless Pantheran, Star
Runner would never admit fear. She would not know how to ask for help
either. A genderless Pantheran who was not up to the task, whatever
the task was, would be declared surplus and terminated. Star Runner
would be looking for ways to cover her fear and her ignorance. She was
looking for a way to just muddle through and get out of this
impossible situation. Star Runner and Christabel were not playing
games in the control center. They were seeking a way out.</p>
<p>If only either one of them had said something. It would help a lot.</p>
<p>Then came the good-byes and the promises to visit again., Ronnie
wondered if Pru and Salim would come back. They would if they were
still on Transfer Point Seventeen in a few days. Otherwise, they would
pack their bags and leave as soon as possible and probably without a
backward glance. As far as Ronnie knew, they had not been in touch
with Captain Star Runner since they had gone their separate ways after
reaching the Blue Fire Star System.</p>
<p>After the pair of friends had left, Ronnie continue to sit at the
table, wondering what she could do to help get them out of the Lystran
empire and back into Space Trader Guild controlled space. It would be
such a relief to be away from the shooting war though if the People of
the Golden Sun continued to take over planets and star systems, it
would not be long until conflict came knocking.</p>
<p>Christabel said, “Suri Iglesia wishes permission to come aboard to
speak with Detective Ronnie Camberwell.”</p>
<p>I froze. What was this about? Suri had left without a backwards
glance. She did not say “Good riddance” but she just as well might
have.</p>
<p>“Detective Ronnie Camberwell,” Captain Star Runner said through the
speaker in the lounge. “Do you wish to see Suri Iglesia?”</p>
<p>“What does she want?” I asked.</p>
<p>“One moment,” Captain Star Runner said. “I will ascertain her reason.”</p>
<p>There was a a pause. My heart was beating rapidly. What could she
want with me? What would I say to her?</p>
<p>“Suri Iglesia wants to contact with you for a particular job  with a
limited duration on Transfer Point Seventeen.” Captain Star Runner’s
voice was non-committal.</p>
<p>A job? How could I accept a job? How would I be able to leave the
transfer point if I left the ride and was working?</p>
<p>“I would like to speak with Suri Iglesia,” I said, hoping my voice did
not tremble. The palms of my hands were damp. Was I that nervous? How
would I react to Suri.</p>
<p>I did not go to the airlock. Suri knew her way around the ride.
Security cameras would pick up her movements.</p>
<p>I heard her quick step in the corridor. She paused in the doorway of
the lounge. We considered each other. I did not rise from the table.
We did not speak immediately.</p>
<p>What first struck me was how different Suri looked. I saw her through
Mrs. Page’s eyes. (Mrs. Parge was my foster mother back in Ptolemy
City.) It was an odd feeling. Mrs. Parge would have noticed how
dressed up Suri was, how her hair was plated with sparkling jewels,
how she was wearing makeup and jewelry, how unpractical her shoes
were. Instead of the archeology student, I was seeing the accomplished
Suri Iglesia, the Suri Iglesia her family had raised to be a trophy on
some man’s arm.</p>
<p>I had learned from Suri that Lystran society was patriarchal. Lesbian
sex was tolerated though women from important families married.
Adultery was punishable by death though rarely was necessary to
prohibit it. Shame and exposure was sufficient. Male homosexuality was
despised. Shame and exposure worked there, too. What people did before
marriage did not count. Unmarried young adults were free to
experiment.</p>
<p>When Suri told me this, I wondered if I was a failed experiment. She
had found my lovemaking inadequate. A good part of that was my lack of
mammary glands. She had six. I only have two. Across where my hips
are, Suri had openings for insemination. These remain closed unless
aroused. When they are open, they are quite sensitive. I had bungled
taking advantage of that badly. I knew better now how to pleasure a
Lystran female. I certainly did not want to find out how to pleasure a
male Lystran. I have only been penetrated once and that was a horrible
experience I hope never to repeat.</p>
<p>Suri waited for me to fully appreciate her transformation. When she
judged I had taken her all in, she walked across the lounge, swinging
her hips just a little to suggest our intimacies. I caught my breath
and said without thinking, “You look quite beautiful today?”</p>
<p>“Do you think so?” Suri asked, stopping several steps from her chair.</p>
<p>I am certain you think so, Ronnie thought. Well, I guess you are.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do,” I said. “You look so much better than you did on Planet X
and I thought you were spectacular then.”</p>
<p>Suri smiled and wiggled the slightest little bit. She was arousing me
and I had hoped I would not be aroused.</p>
<p>“Things were good there, were they not?” she said, implying all those
times we had touched each other out of Captain Star Runner’s view.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said and I knew she knew I was breathing quite hard.</p>
<p>“We will see if we can find a time to renew our acquaintance.” She
smiled again after saying the word acquaintance. This was hardly a
declaration of love or a promise to pick up where we had left off. She
was dangling the possibility in front of me to get what she wanted
from me. I am no fool. I was being played.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry you are caught behind the lines,” Suri said as she sat down.</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>“Since you are here,” Suri continued, apparently seeing that I was not
going to indulge myself with woeful expressions, “I have a little job
for you if you are interested.”</p>
<p>“I could be,” I said. I do not do coy well, but I can try.</p>
<p>“So many of our men have gone to defend us.” Suri sighed dramatically.
Would she ever stop play acting and get to the point? “Women have had
to step forward and do their jobs.” She paused. I said nothing. “As a
result, some investigations are waiting for investigators. As you are
an investigator, I thought you could handle one or two of them.”</p>
<p>She smiled brightly at me again. “My family has responsibility
foreseeing to it that  these are taken care of. I said you might be interested while
you are waiting for clearance. A good showing in this area might make
that clearance come a little quicker.”</p>
<p>It did not mean it would. It was the bait dangling in front of me. I
suspected Lystrans always baited two hooks: one was Suri and the other
was getting out of here. I suspected also both would be pulled back if
I reached for either of them.</p>
<p>Well, that is a poorly constructed metaphor, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>“I am not permitted to leave this spaceship and return again,” I said.
Let me stick to the practical objections first.</p>
<p>“No problem,” Suri said in that same bright voice.</p>
<p>“I will need everything in writing,” I said.</p>
<p>“Again, no problem.”</p>
<p>“What are these little cases?” I asked.</p>
<p>Suri’s cheeriness drained away. I almost thought it was real.</p>
<p>“There has been two deaths in our section of the Transfer Point,” Suri
explained. “These are not high-ranking men, but my family believes
no murder should go revenged. We need to know who did it and more
important, why.”</p>
<p>I thought of Heracles Beja. Who was taking revenge for his life? Suri
had seemed so uninterested in finding out who had done it.</p>
<p>I believe in justice. I am a former police officer. I was taught at
Simon Parge’s knee, the man who invented justice for Ptolemy City
which previously had been a totally lawless place. Justice did not
seem to be a factor here. Family honor did. Could I work in such an
environment? I did not know. What I did know was that I had to say
Yes. Saying No could have consequences neither Captain Star Runner nor
I could anticipate. There were no references in Christabel’s databases
for this.</p>
<p>“Give me what you have,” I said. “I will look it over and the contract
and then I will let you know if I think I can help you.”</p>
<p>For a moment I thought Suri was going to go into one of her rages. She
could go from giggly and playful to outrage and indignation in the
blink of an eye. But she did not do that. She simply said,, “I will
get you everything as soon as I can.”</p>
<p>And she left.</p>
<p>When the airlock closed and Suri was on her way, I went to the control
center.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” I asked.</p>
<p>I was asking Captain Star Runner but I was also asking Christabel.</p>
<p>“It sounds dangerous,” Captain Star Runner said immediately. I knew
she had already talked to Christabel about this.</p>
<p>“It sounded dangerous to me, too,” I said. “Refusing also seemed
dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” Christabel said. “She has you between the proverbial rock
and hard place. You have to accept her terms. Asking for written
assurances was a smart move. It may not bind anyone here on the
station, but they will loose face and I think that is very important
in Lystran society.”</p>
<p>“I hope to wrap these investigations up quickly,” I said. “The longer
you wait on these things the harder they are to solve. I suspect they
will be pretty straight forward. I cannot imagine Suri’s family would
give me anything too difficult or too high profile to work on.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure they are not looking to blame you?” Captain Star Runner
asked.</p>
<p>“I was not blamed for Heracles Beja’s death,” I said. “Therefore, I do
not think I will be blamed for this one.”</p>
<p>“That one is still not solved,” Christabel said. “Does he have a
family who needs to  avenge his death?”</p>
<p>“From what Suri said,” I said, knowing full well she might not be a
reliable source, “he was from a ‘no account’, her words, family. They
might want revenge but they do not have any hope of getting it.”</p>
<p>“Just be careful,” Captain Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“I will be careful,” I said. “I have no intention of becoming another
victim.”</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>I said, “You do need to promise one thing, Captain Star Runner.”</p>
<p>Star Runner’s whiskers twitched. I rarely use Star Runner’s title when
speaking directly to her.</p>
<p>“You need to promise me you will not leave Transfer Point Seventeen
without me.”</p>
<p>“I promise,” Captain Star Runner said. “You are my responsibility.”</p>
<p>“Remember that,” I said.</p>
<p>I hoped she would. I was afraid, but how could Captain Star Runner
ever consider leaving Lystra without me.</p>
<div class="section" id="star-runner-narrates">
<h2>Star Runner Narrates<a class="headerlink" href="#star-runner-narrates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I was so pleased to be reunited with Pru Dillow and Salim. They
brought me up-to-date with their activities and I did the same,,
skipping quickly over the events on Planet X. They did not need to
know.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>Of course, these two also had a need to know. Had
Star Runner shared with them, it would have learned
some important information which effects the story. I
do not know how it affects the story right now, but I
need to figure that out.</p>
</div>
<p>I was pleased also that Detective Ronnie Camberwell seemed to get
along with them all right, especially Pru Dillow. I did not know how
to talk to Detective Ronnie Camberwell right now and she was so
out-of-sorts. I knew she was trying to adapt to life aboard the ride
in our current circumstances, but she was clearly suffering from
depression. I was glad to see she had made an effort with her
appearance. Ronnie is not a conventionally beautiful Terry. She is
large, strong, awkward in her movements. Nevertheless, she can look
competent and assured. She almost pulled that look off when she met my
friends.</p>
<p>The arrival of Suri Iglesia was another matter. I did not think I
should turn her away. Her family did have some importance on the
Transfer Point. Christabel was still trying to find out how</p>
<p>all the family connections worked in Lystran society. We had a few
textbooks but they were quite limited. A <em>Who’s Who</em> would have been
extremely  helpful. Christabel suggested I leave the decision up to
Detective Ronnie Camberwell.</p>
<p>The sexual innuendos were not lost on either Christabel or me.
Detective Ronnie Camberwell was being manipulated. We surmised that
Detective Ronnie Camberwell knew this and struggled valiantly to
resist Suri Iglesia’s wiles, but in the end, Detective Ronnie
Camberwell had to agree. There really was not a choice.</p>
<p>Christabel reviewed the contract when it came and altogether we
studied the information Suri Iglesia had provided.</p>
<p>The contract and the assurance was simple. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
could return to the ride when her work was finished. What finished
meant was not explained. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was indentured to
the Iglesia family until she finished her job successfully. She would
be housed, fed and clothed during this period. She would be paid a
small sum when her work was completely, enough the contract said to
make it possible for her to “resume a regular life.” We did not know
what that meant but it sounded like boiler plate language.
Remuneration was not the point here. Indenture was a bitter pill to
swallow, but Detective Ronnie Camberwell swallowed it for, as she
said, “the good of the order”.</p>
<p>When we finished with the contract, we moved onto the murders.</p>

<p>This felt like old times. Detective Ronnie Camberwell, Christabel and
I were working together on a case. For the moment, I put aside that
Detective Ronnie Camberwell would be going onto Transfer Point
Seventeen to interact with Lystrans and especially Suri Iglesia. That
was later. This was now. I was still basking in the pleasure of seeing
Pru Dillow and Salim again. They were doing well. We had made a more
formal arrangement to keep in touch. We had been through some very
difficult times together. That bond was still there even in the good
times. I was very happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Christabel had done some initial organization of the case material. We

forth conversation will be awkward. Let me try just
writing it out and figure out the the conversational
gambit later.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Two men have been murdered several weeks apart. They are both young.
Neither of them comes from an important family.</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The manner of their deaths is similar which is causing them to be
grouped together. Because there are only two of them, a pattern cannot
be established.</p></li>
<li><p>The Iglesia family is concerned about their deaths because
unexplained deaths dishonor the family.</p></li>
<li><p>Policing is not an honorable profession because the police come
into contact with disreputable people who are neither virtuous nor
typically successful. A successful crook may be respected for his
cleverness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“That is a pretty thin line,” Christabel observed.
“You are a petty criminal until you can string together enough crimes
to be successful.”</p>
<p>“It sounds a lot like the Pharaoh Star System,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said. “You are a petty pirate until you strike it big. Then
you might be considered reputable and legitimate businesses come to
you for their legitimate work.”</p>
<p>“True,” Christabel said. “But the environment in the Pharaoh Star
System sounds very different than Lystra.”</p>
<p>“I am getting that impression. Lystra is very class conscious. Are the
respected families government-appointed or related to a royal family
or what? Do you know, Christabel?”</p>
<p>“It appears to be a patronage system,” Christabel responded. “If you
once did something for the ruler, you got a position. If you did not
screw anything up, you kept your position and became entrenched. Once
entrenched, you have opportunities to continue to stay entrenched.”</p>
<p>“According to what I am reading here,” I put in, “The Iglesia family
may be a big deal here on Transfer Point Seventeen, but in general,
transfer points are not high level appointments. If they were
planet side, they would be significant. You are dealing with a big
goldfish in a little lake.”</p>
<p>“A big fish in a small pond,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell corrected.</p>
<p>“That is what I said,” I said.</p>
<p>“Close enough,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, going back to her
study.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>Both men worked in the maintenance areas. They were both techs but
they did different jobs. One worked on sanitation and one worked on
air supply. This looks more like the area where they could be
killed as there are fewer security cameras and no one around them.</p></li>
<li><p>Their friends and co-workers were questioned. No one had noticed
anything strange in the days before their deaths. Neither man had
been acting peculiarly. Neither man appeared worried or distracted.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing appeared to be stolen on their bodies or in their lockers
or in their dormitory.</p></li>
<li><p>The men lived in the same dormitory. Dormitory assignments are
random and are determined by  gender and age rather than job descriptions.</p></li>
<li><p>One man had worked on Transfer Point Seventeen for seven months
while the other one had worked here for three years.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the men knew each other, they were not friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Forensics talks a lot about the weapon used but cannot provide
hair samples, fingerprints,   in fared data, extraneous
DNA–nothing at all.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“There is really not a lot to go on here,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell
concluded.</p>
<p>“The weapon information is jumbled,” Christabel said. “Did you notice
that?”</p>
<p>“It sounds like gibberish,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “I
cannot even figure out what the weapon is.”</p>
<p>“That is my point,” Christabel responded. “That is why I called it
jumbled. Would I be correct in stating that they do not know what
killed these men?”</p>
<p>“That would be incorrect,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said after
rereading the reports.  “They do not have the weapon. They know of a
weapon that would kill in this way. They cannot imagine a weapon that
kills in this way. In other words, they could not build or make a
weapon of this sort. They have never heard of anything like it.
Therefore, they do not know what killed these men.”</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>I am on the brink of violating one of Ronald Knox’s
commandments for writing detective stories. He
characterized it as inventing a poison that does not
exist. I am not describing a weapon that does not
exist. It existed in this universe. The overworked
police force or forensics laboratory just have not
seen it because it belongs to a race they do not know
about.</p>
</div>
<p>“Are there any weapons in your databases that match the description of
what this weapon did?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked us.</p>
<p>“No,” Christabel said promptly.</p>
<p>“Can you speculate on what sort of a weapon it might be?” Detective
Ronnie Camberwell asked. From what I have read in these reports, the
weapon is the only lead I have. I can re-interview everybody. I can
visit the scene of the crime, but I do not think I will learn anything
new. I cannot see the bodies. They have been recycled already which is
standard procedure on a space station.”</p>
<p>“Specific cells in the brain were disrupted,” Christabel said. “These
cells govern both personality and morality. Essentially, the weapon
destroyed who these men were. When that part of their brain died,
their whole body shut down.”</p>
<p>“I do not understand,” I said. I had been following the conversation
very closely, but this made no sense to me. “I would have thought the
two men  would have gone on living in a vegetative state.”</p>
<p>“I would have thought that, too,” Christabel said, “but that is not
what happened to them.”</p>
<p>“It is as if this weapon is a spirit killer,” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.</p>
<p>“The weapon killed their spirit and then they died?” I asked. “How can
this happen?”</p>
<p>“The ancients would have called it a soul killing weapon,” Christabel
said.</p>
<p>We all were silent for a time. It sounded like a terrible weapon</p>
<p>“So the question is,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, “who has such
a weapon and why did they use it on these two men? They do not seem
dangerous men.”</p>
<p>“Were they just random victims?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Just two of them?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked. “I would have
thought there would be more killings if someone was running around
with a soul killing weapon. This makes no sense at all.”</p>
<p>“I do not think a soul killing weapon is possible,” I said.</p>
<p>“Nothing else fits the facts,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.</p>
<p>I thought of Sherlock Holmes, but I did not bring him up. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell had criticized me for making a fictional comparison
back on Planet X.</p>
<p>Christabel and I discussed Planet X in our back channel. Could this be
a Tigerfu weapon?</p>
<p>“Or something the People of the Rainbow Sky have or something the
Followers of the Stars have,” Christabel added. “Our records are so
incomplete. I think it is fair to say this is not a Lystran weapon.”</p>
<p>“What can we share with Detective Ronnie Camberwell?”</p>
<p>“Not much,” Christabel said. “We do not have much to share.”</p>
<p>“What are you two talking about?” Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.</p>
<p>“Us?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to look innocent.” Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded
irritated. “You two are always talking about something.”</p>
<p>“It would appear,” Christabel said before I could answer, “that this
weapon is made by or was made by an advanced race. It is either a new
weapon newly created or an old weapon created a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Or an old style weapon newly revived,” I put in. This displeased
Christabel. She thought I was pushing Detective Ronnie Camberwell in a
direction of inquiry we were still keeping secret.</p>
<p>“So maybe someone on the transfer point acquired this weapon and was
trying it out on some low-level people,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell
said. She looked very unhappy.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The weapon is from a long time ago and belongs to an advanced race.
Someone found it and says, what the heck. I’ll try it out on
somebody who is working alone in the maintenance area. Bang.
They’re dead. Wow. Let me try this out again. Bang. Wow. This other
guy is dead, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone found a book. Wow. Here’s a nifty weapon. Let me build it.
How does it work? Let me try it out on some tech alone at his job.
Bang. It works. Let me do this again. Bang. Yes, it still works.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“I don’t like either scenario,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “The
killings cannot be random. These are not tests or even examples. If
they were examples, we would have to be told what the deaths mean. No
one has done that.”</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell shook her head. “I am willing to posit a
weapon from beyond the Lystran empire. It is a strange and complex
galaxy. All sorts of races have learned all sorts of things. Some
races have been around a long time. They may have invented things we
know nothing about. It is a dangerous to go on an assumption like this
in police work, but I do not see an alternative. Nevertheless, I think
there must have been a reason why these two men were killed. If I can
find the motive, I may be able to find the killer. My biggest problem
is that this is a transfer point. The killer could have left the
transfer point weeks ago. These are cold cases. They are hard to
solve.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying it is hopeless? What about your contract?” I asked. I
was a little panicky. I did not want Detective Ronnie Camberwell held
on Transfer Point Seventeen indefinitely because she could not solve
the case.</p>
<p>“I need to to find a way to know these men.” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell paused, twirling a lock of hair in her fingers. With this
gesture, I knew she was thinking. “I need to inhabit them. The only
way I can do this is to go under cover as one of them.”</p>
<p>“How?” I asked. “You are not a Lystran. They would not allow you to
work in the tech area if you do not know anything about it. You are
not a man anyway.”</p>
<p>“Suri always says I am a man when she is displeased with me, if I have
done something awkward or not to her liking&lt;” Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said slowly. “If I am right, and tell me if I am right or
wrong, Christabel, I could pass as a Lystran man. I have the height
and the build for it, I think. Suri is coming back to take me to her
seamstress to get fitted with appropriate garments. If I tell the
seamstress to also make me men’s wear, I am sure I can apply as a
general purpose worker and get a space in the same dormitory. I am an
off worlder stuck here by the war. They are short-handed. I need work
because I will starve without it. Given all this, I may just pull it
off.”</p>
<p>“I think you are right,” Christabel said. “Lystran male clothes are
also not form fitting. If you can hide the fact that you are not
anatomically male, you should fit in.”</p>
<p>“That will be easy enough,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. “I am a
Terry. They have never seen a Terry male.”</p>
<p>I was surprised Detective Ronnie Camberwell used that word, Terry, but
Christabel pointed out to me along our back channel that Detective
Ronnie Camberwell could use any old word for her species and not be
corrected. Terry was a word she was familiar with if she needed to use
it quickly in all manner of situations.</p>
<p>“I need to pull a few things together,” Detective Ronnie Camberwell
said. “Suri is coming for me soon.”</p>
<p>Detective Ronnie Camberwell stood up. “Captain Star Runner,” she said,
“I need you to promise me something.”</p>
<p>“What is that?” I asked. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was being very
formal.</p>
<p>“Captain Star Runner,” Detective Camberwell said, “I need you to
promise you will not leave Transfer Point Seventeen without me.”</p>
<p>“I promise,” I said quickly. “I would never leave without you,
Detective Ronnie Camberwell.”</p>
<p>And I meant it.</p>
<div class="admonition-twist admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">TWIST</p>

<li><p>The case reports Captain Star Runner, Detective Ronnie Camberwell and

<li><p>he soul killing weapon does not exist.</p></li>
<li><p>Ronnie will figure this out when she thinks to look at the report
filed on Heracles Beja’s death. It will be identical to one of the
reports she received.</p></li>
<li><p>The simple explanation of Heracles Beja’s report is that Suri Iglesia
copied the first report without making any changes, expecting no one
to read it carefully or correlate it with the two dead maintenance
workers.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Suri’s class consciousness did not let her see either the
maintenance workers or Heracles as important enough to be looked
at carefully.</p></li>
<li><p>Suri did not want to draw attention to herself and copying the
report would allow the report to be filed on a lower class person
and thus get him off the radar.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>am wondering if someone from the Followers of the Stars or the
Tigerfu killed the two maintenance workers. Either race would stand
out on Transfer Point Seventeen. The Tigerfu might be a better bet.
The killer might have been able to disguise himself as a Lystran. The
bear-like Followers of the Stars would have difficulty doing that. On
the other hand, one of the members of either race could have fingered
one of the Lystrans. Prince hat is a manipulator and I like him for
the part of using others.</p></li>
<li><p>The People of the Rainbow Sky and the Followers of the Stars are
working together to cause the collapse of their old enemy the Lystran

it. In this way the Followers of the Stars continue their
exploitation of the Tigerfu.</p></li>

<h2>Ronnie Narrates<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suri looked me over critically.</p>
<p>“You cannot wear those clothes here,” she said. “I will need to take
you to my seamstress to have all new clothes made. You need to look
like a Lystran woman.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>I waited for her to explode. She did.</p>
<p>“No,” I said again firmly. “You hired me to find out who killed these
men. I intend to do that. I cannot find out dressed like a Lystran
woman. The men will not talk to me. I cannot go into the maintenance
areas where they worked. I cannot poke around, stand around, look
around the way I need to in order to solve this case.”</p>
<p>“You will scandalize everyone dressed like that,” Suri insisted. Her
manner was all-knowing and condescending to me.</p>
<p>“I do not intend to dress like this,” I explained to her. “I intend to
go to your seamstress and have her design clothes that will make me
looked similar to the way those men looked. I intend to get a bed in
their dormitory. I intend to hang out where they hung out and possibly
get a job in maintenance.”</p>
<p>Suri was speechless.</p>
<p>“You cannot do that,” she finally said. Her shock was great.</p>
<p>“I must,” I said. “If I cannot do these things, I cannot solve your
case.”</p>
<p>“The Morality Board will not like it,” Suri said weakly. “I will be
implicated, too.”</p>
<p>I saw immediately the Morality Board had great power on Transfer Point
Seventeen. That was good to know.</p>
<p>“Does the Morality Board approve of murder?” I asked, pressing my
advantage.</p>
<p>“Certainly not.” Suri was regaining her air of indignation.</p>
<p>“Which is a greater offense, murder or cross-dressing?”</p>
<p>Suri made a rude noise. “What do you think?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I am asking because I am unfamiliar with your mores,” I said. “If
murder is a more serious offense, then I will use whatever skill I
have to uncover the murderers.”</p>
<p>“There is only one,” Suri said quickly, then regretted her outburst.</p>
<p>“Only one?” I questioned. “How do you know?”</p>
<p>“I do not,” Suri said, trying to cover her early mistake. “I just do
not want to think there are two such degenerates aboard the transfer
point.”</p>
<p>I did not tell her the likelihood the murderer was still around was
small.s With a war on, the murderer could easily enlist and kill all he wanted.</p>
<p>“So are we agreed that I go to the seamstress and get my man clothes?”
I asked. “You always say I am just like a man. I should pass well
enough.”</p>
<p>Grudgingly, Suri agreed. Throwing those man references in my face
pleased her. Acting on her retorts made her very quiet. Her volatile
nature confused me. I wondered if Suri was acting out some juvenile
attraction through fained dislike.</p>
<p>I always find the dock areas of space stations grubby. They are cold,
too. They smell of machinery, lubricants and paint. The spacers who are
coming and going often seem furtive, intoxicated or just creepy. It
always amazes me that Captain Star Runner who is so fastidious about
her appearance, feels so at home in these places.</p>
<p>I was not prepared for the interior of Transfer Point Seventeen. My
first shock was how grimy everything looked.</p>
<p>I have to admit my only acquaintance with space stations is the
Alexandria Space Station, the gateway to the Pharaoh Star System and
Half Moon Bay Space Station. The Alexandria Space Station is bright
and sparkling and to the extent possible, gives the traveler an sense
of openness and airiness. Tara Lee Harrington, my former lover and
space station security chief, told me that passengers coming from and
leaving Ptolemy City could typically afford such luxuries. Their
ticket prices paid for the wider corridors and higher ceilings and
warmth.</p>
<p>I had been to a number of pods on Half moon Bay Station. Some were
newer. Some were older. Some were designed on a more open floor plan
while others were quite enclosed. They were all well-maintained, a
condition of being part of the larger governmental organization that
was Half Moon Bay Space Station.</p>
<p>There was a smell. It was not the odor I associated with Suri. All
races have their own odor. If Captain Star Runner was present she
could have identified it. The longer I stayed aboard the transfer
point, the more I realized it was the smell of cooked food and waste.
The sanitation systems could not scrub strong odors out of the
recycled air. The smells made their way into fabric and, I am
convinced, the walls, floors and ceilings of the place. It was
unpleasant. I tried not to show I noticed. Suri did not seem to notice
it.</p>
<p>The seamstress, too, was a surprise. Her shop was a small room. We
entered it through a shop that sold hardware or fittings. I was never
sure exactly what all the parts and pieces were for. That a seamstress
worked behind a parts store seemed very strange to me. The
seamstress–I never knew her name–was not related to any of the
people in the parts store. She simply rented this room. As I got to
know the transfer point better, I learned there were lots of rooms
that could only be entered by transversing at least one other room.
Not all rooms had access to the corridors.</p>
<p>The seamstress was probably in middle age. Her skin was mottled. her
hands were arthritic. Her teeth were mere stumps and some were
missing. She had large bald spots on her head. There was something
wrong with her feet. She had difficulty walking. The word <em>hag</em> came
to mind.</p>
<p>When I asked Suri about her, she simply said, “She has five
children,” as if that explained everything. Maybe it did. Two were the
norm. Lystrans give birth to two children at a time. Each child nurses
from three mammary glands on one side. I wondered at if the seamstress
had had three children born at once or two sets of two and one set of
one. I never found out.</p>
<p>I did find out that having more than two children was thought to be
morally suspect. It had nothing to do with multiple partners or even
some sort of population control. It was thought to be over indulgent
like drinking too much or eating to much. I suppose it was classified
as gluttony.</p>
<p>The seamstress did not look like a glutton. She looked like a used up,
falling apart woman who needed my pity not my disgust.</p>
<p>I never understood how or why she became Suri’s seamstress.</p>
<p>Suri insisted I explain my requirements to the seamstress. It was as
if Suri wanted no part of this plan. nevertheless, she stayed through
all the measuring. The seamstress also put in an order for boots,
undergarments, toiletries other necessities. She spent a lot of time
poking at my breasts. These are not large. The seamstress worried
about how to strap them. I did not see why she bothered. The standard
wear for young men hid any hint of femininity I have. Lystran fashion
causes them to have large amounts of fabric around their hips,
especially in the back, and gathered tops that puff out in the front
as if they might start crowing at any moment. The extra padding in the
posterior region turns out to be necessary as most seating on the
transfer point is uncushioned and very cold.</p>
<p>I realized belatedly that all the seamstress’s poking and prodding was
for Suri’s enjoyment. I wondered if that was by prearrangement or
whether the seamstress knew Suri’s predilections. Perhaps all young
women were the same. I never found out.</p>
<p>When I finally was dressed in one of my new outfits, I studied myself
critically in the mirrors. It was hard for me to tell how well I could
pass. The clothes felt strange on my body and they certainly did not
flatter me at all. Later, when I observed the other men of my
approximate age and assumed social standing, I discovered what a good
job the seamstress had done. I never had the opportunity to tell her.
What I would not know for a while was how attractive she had made me.
Both men and women looked. Their looks were often lascivious. Their
grins or dropped eyes bewildered me. I had never before been the such
an object of attention. I did not enjoy it. I wanted to hide. It made
me rethink the attention I give beautiful or sexy women.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27">Chapter Sixteen: Man About Town</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-sixteen-man-about-town" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I did not know what to expect. I got some basic information and set
about being a man from a backward planet in the Lystran Empire. That
was not really as hard to do as I had originally thought it might be.
Most of the young men in the dormitories were just like me–the
undercover me. They came from villages on poor planets. They came to a
transfer point hoping for better employment and a way to send money
back home. Or they came looking to escape their pasts. They found
themselves in low-paying jobs, owing money to the controlling families
which kept them
indentured with no way of redeeming themselves. They lived in cramped,
drafty dormitories, eating poor food with no medical care. If they
were too sick to work for too long, they lost their space in the
dormitory. They lost their food card. They turned into criminals,
living in the bowels of the transfer point. Or they committed suicide,
too ashamed to beg or steal. The controlling families, with a war on,
found many recruits for the military. Although their servitude was not
reduced, the pay and living conditions were said to be better. They
signed up and shipped out. The controlling families called them cannon
fodder. I wondered how many of them would survive the war no matter
who won it. All in all it was a depressing business. I was cold and
tired much of the time. My work was menial. My questions were met
with disinterest and grunts. I could find no one who had ever heard of
either man. After a while, I began to think they had never existed.</p>
<p>One day when I was sitting at a filthy table choking down a watery
bowl of vegetable soup–if there were any vegetables in the soup they
were peelings only–I began to ask myself what I was accomplishing. I
decided to spend the afternoon going over my reports. If I did not
show up for the afternoon shift, my pay would be docked. I had credit
of my own. I would survive. With so many men going off to the front,
shifts were often poorly staffed and men went missing all the time.</p>
<p>I could find nothing in the case files that gave me any ideas. Because
I was at an impasse, I took out the report I had been given on
Heracles Beja. His report seemed very much like the others which was
very odd. I ran a comparison. Except for a few items like physical
description, date and place of birth, Heracles Beja’s report was
identical to that of one of the dead men. How could this be? Heracles
Beja was killed with a ray gun. I knew that. I had seen the body. That
was the conclusion the robot concierge came to as well. We never found
the ray gun, but that meant nothing. It is a big planet and the ray
gun could have gone into a recycle, off a balcony or into the river
with no one the wiser. I knew it had not come aboard Captain Star
Runner’s ride. Star Runner checked for weapons. Whoever had killed
Heracles Beja had disposed of himself and his weapon.</p>
<p>But this report bothered me. I read it over several times. It was
marked with all the official virtual seals it was supposed to have,
but I realized the only possible conclusion was that it was a forgery.
If Heracles Beja’s report was a forgery, could these two other reports
be forgeries, too?</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>This is basically hogwash. It will move the story
along for now, but Detective Ronnie Camberwell needs a
lot more than thought to make this and  a few more
conclusions reasonable. I will leave it for now
because I have no idea what this process should look
like at the moment.</p>
</div>
<p>I needed a few answers. I went looking for them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was given clothes for work. My clothes from the
seamstress were still in new condition.. I put them on and went
looking for the police department.</p>
<p>By now I had a much better idea of how this transfer point worked.
Transfer Point Seventeen was very old. It creaked along, but many
parts of it were broken or out of order. There was not a regular
maintenance schedule for non-essential services. The store I went
through to reach the seamstress, for instance, was a parts
store–parts to repair almost anything–cook stoves, refrigeration
units, motorized carts, furniture, lighting, air circulatory, heating
and cooling systems. If there was a machine on the transfer point,
this store and many others like it had parts for it. People went from
store to store, sifting through bins, trying to find the right part.</p>
<p>I found the police room–you could hardly call it a station–behind a
store which appeared to sell used home items. I found bedding,
furniture, lighting fixtures, trays for automatic cookers. Later I
learned it was a consignment store. People were selling off their
goods to pay their bills. Pawn shops were also plentiful. I wondered
if everyone was selling, who was buying.</p>
<p>I showed my reports to the policeman on duty. I had no idea what his
rank was. He gave the reports a superficial review and said, “Not
ours.”</p>
<p>“Not yours?” I asked. I felt stupid after I said it, but what could he
mean? “If they are not yours, whose are they?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “They are our seals,” he said, “but they are not
our reports.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?” I asked.</p>
<p>“They do not have the right signatures and the right watermarks,” he
said. “Someone sold you fake reports.”</p>
<p>He made no offer to file a complaint. I did not inquire about doing
so. The police official seemed uninterested. He did not even suggest I
pay him to do so. Bribery was quite common on the transfer point. I
never was sure if it was legal or just not offense anyone worried
about. I thanked the police official for his time and left the police
room.</p>
<p>I found a shop where I could get something warm to drink and
considered my options.</p>
<p>What did I know?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p>The report I was given and which looked to the non-initiated to be
real, was not.</p></li>
<li><p>The report on Heracles Beja was identical to that of one of the
dead men killed here on the transfer point.</p></li>
<li><p>No one knew either of the two workers killed here on the transfer
point.</p></li>
<li><p>Could I safely conclude the men were as unreal as their case files?</p></li>
<li><p>Why? What was all this about?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My first thought was misdirection. The men were invented to throw
someone off the track. Off the track of what? Who was supposed to be
thrown off the track? I was hired to, ostensibly, help the police
force but clearly the police force was not involved because the two
men had not died. They were fictitious.</p>
<p>What point was served by having me investigate? I had not seen Suri
Iglesia since I left the seamstress shop. She had indicated, rather
brusquely and with her usual disregard for anyone else’s feelings,
that she was disassociating herself from me. I could turn my findings
over to the police. They were expecting my report.</p>
<p>But when I had gone into the police room, they did not know who I was
nor did they care.</p>
<p>I was someone’s dupe, but I did not know whose. Did I care? Should I
just walk away and go back to Captain Star Runner’s ride? And do what?</p>
<p>We had worked together on the case files–Christabel and I had worked
on the case files. I corrected myself. Captain Star Runner and I had
not interacted much at all for a long time. I started going back
before I received the contract to protect Suri Iglesia. I lived on
Half Moon Bay Space Station. I worked with Jack Whicher. Captain Star
Runner lived aboard her ride and came and went running her
high-speed courier business. We saw each other when Captain Star
Runner was docked at the space station for any amount of time. As the
months progressed, our conversations had lagged. We had less and less
to say to one another. Our lovemaking had been perfunctory and less
often. I found myself not wanting to go to restaurants in my pod with
her. I did not want to be known as the humanoid who hung around with a
Pantheran. Captain Star Runner was well-respected as someone who could
give you fast turn around, but she did not fit in well at Half Moon
Bay Space Station. She was an outsider, far more so than I was. She
docked her ride on the seedier side, preferring low rates to classier
facilities. Her ride was well-maintained, of course, but
dockside ambiance did not interest her at all.</p>
<p>I liked a better standard of living. I liked the people I met who
lived and worked on the station. In a very real sense, we were not
spacers. We just happened to live on a space station. We did not enjoy
space travel. The long runs through hyperspace either bored us or
frightened us. We liked our creature comforts and for the most part,
we could get them. We could even spend time in the garden areas,
pretending we were planet side. I had a favorite bench in a little
grove of trees. Right now I could not remember their name or where
they came from. A week living on transfer Point Seventeen had robbed
me of that beauty.</p>
<p>The weapon was not a soul killer. This transfer point is the soul
killer.</p>
<p>Then I remembered. The weapon was not real.</p>
<p>So what was the point of all this?</p>
<p>One of the dangers of police work, especially the private work i do,
is becoming emotionally involved. At first, I was in danger of
becoming emotionally involved with Suri Iglesia. Perhaps I had become
involved. Perhaps I still was. The ability to walk away is very
important.. Jack Whicher told me that all the time. It might work well
in novels to have the investigator solve the crime on his or her own
time, but practically speaking, that makes no sense. There are other
jobs and others things to do. If you are invested in one outcome or
another, you are bound to get into trouble.</p>
<p>I knew all that, but there was no where else to go and nothing else to
do. I resolved to get to the bottom of this mess.</p>
<p>To that end, I went in search of Suri Iglesia.  Had I not, had I
returned to Captain Star Runner’s ride, this story would have had a
very different ending.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-seventeen-asking-questions">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">Chapter Seventeen: Asking Questions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-seventeen-asking-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>I do not know how to go about writing this chapter. Ronnie
wants to get to the bottom of things. How will she start
going about it?</p>
</div>
<p>My first order of business was to figure out who to talk to first. The
logical person was Suri herself.</p>
<p>Tracking Suri Iglesia down was not an easy matter. I continued to
maintain my male identity. This made for social complications.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Did I have an appointment</p></li>
<li><p>Was I on the approved list?</p></li>
<li><p>What was this in reference to?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I have a referral?</p></li>
<li><p>Did I have a letter of introduction?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The man asking me these questions was not so much a footman or a
butler but a bouncer. He was quite intimidating. I had no idea if Suri
was in at the complex of rooms called her home. The local word was
compound. I simply did not go away and kept asking to see her on a
private matter. Apparently that was not sufficient.</p>
<p>I stood in one of Transfer Point Seventeen’s unadorned and grimy
corridors facing a non-descript metal door. There was no doubt in my
mind it was reinforced with a sophisticated locking mechanism. I could
not see the man I was speaking to, but I was certain he could see me
via the security cameras placed at strategic points around the door,
above me and in the corridor itself. The door looked old like
everything on Transfer Point Seventeen. At some point in its history
there was an attack or someone tried to force their way in. The door
was scorched. Jagged lines scored its surface and there were numerous
holes. I could not tell how deep either defacement went, but I could
not see light through any of the holes.</p>
<p>“You will have to give me something,” the bouncer was saying, “or this
conversation will end and it will not be restarted.”</p>
<p>What could I say to get this man to contact Suri? I took a deep mental
breath and took a chance. What else could I do?</p>
<p>“I represent Heracles Beja,” I said.</p>
<p>“Heracles Beja is dead,” the man said dismissively. “You cannot
represent him.”</p>
<p>“OH yes I can,” I said, suddenly feeling my role. “I represent
Heracles Beja’s interests and his part of the intellectual property
from Planet X.”</p>
<p>The bouncer hesitated. He would have no intimate knowledge of what
happened on Planet X or perhaps even what intellectual property there
might be.
&quot;Very well,” He said. “I will determine if it would be appropriate to
see Suri Iglesia on this matter or whether it would be better for you
to speak to someone else in the family.”</p>
<p>That was not what I had intended, but I was committed. Perhaps a
family member would be more helpful than Suri had been. She had a lot
of explaining to do.</p>
<p>After a long wait, the door swung open. There was a lot of squealing
noises. Did anyone on this Transfer Point know anything about greasing
hinges? Why did they use hinges anyway? (Later I learned that
everything on the transfer point was mechanical so that a power
failure would not interrupt the opening and closings of doors. This
meant, of course, that no area could be quickly sealed against an air
leak or other calamity. This would have dire consequences for Transfer
Point Seventeen later.)</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>A dramatic possibility is an attack on the transfer point.
There could be a significant breach with many deaths. I am
not sure if I want to go down that avenue but it does make
for some excitement. It may be a good way for Detective
Ronnie Camberwell to discover Captain Star Runner has left
the transfer point despite Star Runner’s promise to her.</p>
</div>
<p>I was escorted through several rooms before I went through another
scorched, scored and shot up door into another section of the
compound. Clearly this was a more lived in area. There were actually
carpets on the metal floors.</p>
<p>I entered a small sitting room. Suri Iglesia stood in its center.</p>
<p>My escort allowed me to enter while remaining in the doorway.</p>
<p>“You may leave,” Suri instructed him.</p>
<p>“But Celser,” he began.</p>
<p>“I said ‘leave us’,” Suri snapped. He left, but did not close the door
behind him. Suri went to it quickly and very quietly closed it.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Suri said, whispering and seeming to hiss
at me.</p>
<p>Having heard a Pantheran really hiss, her attempts at outrage did not
impress me. When Captain Star Runner hisses, she arches her back and
puffs up all over. It is quite an impressive sight. Suri Iglesia on
the other hand seemed far more frightened than angry. Her anger was
only a cover for something else–fear most likely.</p>
<p>“I came to report,” I said. “Your bouncer was quite unsympathetic to my
attempts at not drawing attention to either myself or you.”</p>
<p>“You should not have come here.” Suri Iglesia scolded me.</p>
<p>This cloak and dagger approach was getting tiresome. Transfer Point
Seventeen was certainly tiresome: the food, the air, the whole look
and feel of the place. I yearned for Half Moon Bay Station. Was that
now representing home to me? I was not certain. Perhaps it only
represented what security I ever felt I had.</p>
<p>Suri said, “And you should never mention Heracles Beja, especially
here.” She literally stamped her foot in frustration.</p>
<p>“We need to talk,” I said, folding my arms in a Lystran gesture of
absolute immovability.</p>
<p>“Not here,” Suri Iglesia repeated.</p>
<p>“Then where?” I asked. “It has to be now.”</p>
<p>“I cannot leave right now,” Suri Iglesia said in that same low urgent
voice. “There will be too many questions.”</p>
<p>“Where then?” I asked. “When?”</p>
<p>“Number twenty-eight maintenance tunnel,” she whispered. “You know the
place.”</p>
<p>I did. At the appropriate time, I went there.</p>
<p>And that is when Suri Iglesia pulled the ray gun on me.</p>
<p>I do not know what the emergency in her household was or if it was a
well-played means of getting me to maintenance tunnel twenty-eight.
Either way, Suri Iglesia was holding a ray gun on me.</p>
<p>“You know too much,” Suri Iglesia said. “I cannot afford to have you
asking questions.”</p>
<p>I wanted to ask her many questions. I wondered why she thought she had
to kill me. I had learned enough in my short time on Transfer Point
Seventeen that her family was important enough to keep her out of
trouble but not very important in the scheme of things. She could be
shuttled off somewhere where her youthful indiscretions could be
overlooked and then forgotten. After the birth of her two baby pair,
could assume the role of a pampered Lystran matron and everything
would go on as usual. I did not have to die. Why did she think I did?</p>
<p>You would think being in an awful maintenance tunnel with a slightly
hysterical woman pointing a ray gun at you would be terrifying. I
thought about getting into being terrified, and then I channeled the
male Lystran I was pretending to be.</p>
<p>“Put that stupid toy down,” I said as firmly as I could. “The ricochet
could be heard and it could bounce back and hurt you.”</p>
<p>Suri waved the ray gun around which was quite frightening.</p>
<p>“I know how to use this,” she insisted.</p>
<p>“I am certain you do,” I said. And then all at once I knew the answer.
It was the answer Captain Star Runner gave me back on Planet X.</p>
<p>“Why did you killed Heracles Beja,” I asked calmly.</p>
<p>It is true, you know. Criminals really do like boasting about their
exploits. If I could keep her talking and learn her reasons, perhaps
there was a way out of this impasse.</p>
<p>“He was going to publish my work,” Suri Iglesia said, seeming to
forget about the ray gun altogether. It started to lower. I breathed a
little easier.</p>
<p>“I only brought him along as cover and to do some of the harder bits.
He wanted to publish all my work and take credit for it.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a problem,” I said, wanting to keep Suri talking,
wanted to follow her tangled logic.</p>
<p>” I knew him in school, of course,” Suri continued, “He was bright
enough. I figured he could be useful, you know, doing all the grunt
work out there. You know what it was like.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Then what happened?”</p>
<p>“He took all my notes,” Suri said, outrage coming into her voice. She
was becoming strident. “He copied them out himself, creating a field
notebook in his own writing. I had to destroy it, of course.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I agreed, knowing that no such thing had happened. Suri
Iglesia had attached herself to a rising star in the archaeological
field. When his work was complete, she had copied his work and then
killed him for her own ends.</p>
<p>“And do you have the notes?” I asked, hoping that was the right thing
to say.</p>
<p>“You bet I do,” Suri said. “I do not have them stored in any of the
linked systems. I do not want my work to get out until I am ready to
publish. People will be very surprised when I publish my work.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” I asked. Keep her talking. Whatever happens, keep her
talking. I did not dare move toward her though she had just about
forgotten she was holding the ray gun. I could not move fast enough to
wrench it away from her. I was strong enough. I was just too far away.</p>
<p>“I am not ready to publish it yet,” Suri Iglesia said. “I have more
work to do on it. People will be very surprised.”</p>
<p>“Really?” I said. “Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because everybody thinks those structures are only a couple of
thousand years old. They are much older than that. The people who
built them are really, really old.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?” I regretted my question as soon as I had asked it.
Suri’s demeanor changed. She brought the ray gun back up on me.</p>
<p>“Never mind who they are. You do not need to know. You do not need to
know any of this.”</p>
<p>I saw her finger move. She was trying to unlock the safety.</p>
<p>I tried to be ready. When she looked down to unlock the safety, I
needed to move fast. It is a complicated lock. It is designed that way
so the ray gun does not go off prematurely. That makes it a poor
choice for killing people as Suri was trying to kill me.</p>
<p>Suri looked down.</p>
<p>I moved.</p>
<p>Just as I reached her and she released the safety, the alarm sirens
bleared.</p>
<p>“This is not a drill. We are under attack. Report to your designated
locations. This is not a drill. We are under attack.”</p>
<p>Suri Iglesia screamed. Whether she screamed because I grabbed her arm
or whether she screamed because of the siren bleating over our heads I
do not know. She wrenched away from me and ran, quickly disappearing
from view.</p>
<p>“This is not a drill. We are under attack–”</p>
<p>I scooped up the ray gun and I ran, too. I did not run toward any
designated area. I ran toward the docks and Captain Star Runner’s
ride. This might be our chance to escape.</p>
<p>I ran through corridors, pushing past people–all sorts of people. I
did not care if I bumped them, if they went down. I just ran. Barely
able to catch my breath, I ran onto the long platform where the
spaceships were docked. I ran to the place where Captain Star Runner’s
spaceship was.</p>
<p>And it was not there. There was an empty space. The ride was gone.</p>
<p>Stupidly, I ran up and down the platform, looking at all the
spaceships. The bronze disc was not there. There were only torch
ships.</p>
<p>I ran to the dock office Someone was there. I asked where Captain Star
Runner’s spaceship was.</p>
<p>“Left three days ago,” the dock office worker said disinterestedly.</p>
<p>“Where did she go?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” the dock office worker said. “I was not on duty then.
I am closing up now. You should be at your designated area.”</p>
<p>I was thunderstruck. Captain Star Runner had left Transfer Point
Seventeen without me. How could she do that? She had promised. She had
not even communicated with me about it.</p>
<p>The Transfer Point shook violently. I staggered, knocking into the
wall. The dock office worker, who was walking past me, put out his hand
to steady me, then the space station lurched again. We fell in a heap
onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Emergency personnel report to section thirty-five, thirty-six and
thirty-seven,” instructed the loud speaker over our heads. “Sections
thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty and forty-one are open to space.
Refrain from proceeding to those sections.”</p>
<p>I tried to think where those sections were.”</p>
<p>“The upper echelon living areas,” the dock office worker gasped. “That
is where they would have reported to.”</p>
<p>That meant many of the upper class families were dead. Perhaps Suri
Iglesia was one of them.</p>
<p>“Do you know who is attacking us?” I asked. I was still in my role as
a Lystran from somewhere else in the empire.</p>
<p>We were getting to our feet.</p>
<p>“I heard it was the People of the Golden Sun,” the dock office worker
said.</p>
<p>We left the dock area together. I figured it did not much matter where
I went. If I had a designated area, I did not know what it was. This
was not my fight, but I was here. What else was there for me to do?</p>
<p>The dock office worker had said the attack was by the People of the
Golden Sun. That made no sense at all. Lystra was at war with the
People of the Rainbow Sky and so by definition, the People of the
Golden Sun should be their allies. Had something changed? I was not
following the conflict particularly closely. I really was not that
interested so long as the fighting war stayed far away from my
location.</p>
<p>I was turning a corner when it happened. The dock office worker had
run ahead of me, anxious to get to his designated area. I was just
following along, wondering where I was going and what would happen when
I got there.</p>
<p>Suddenly a door opened and someone stepped out. Someone very odd
looking. For a split second I saw the head, the ears, the whiskers.
Could it be Captain Star Runner? Of course not. This being was erect.
The color was all wrong. What sort of a being was this? Was this the
enemy? Was I about to be captured? Tortured? Killed?</p>
<p>I stepped back. The being stepped in front of me and said, “Detective
Ronnie Camberwell. I have been looking for you.”</p>

<p>I just stood in the corridor and stared at the alien. It was quite
tall and quite thin. It had four arms, two on each side. It was
striped and as I had initially thought, it had a cat’s face. Whereas
Captain Star Runner’s face more closely resembled a domestic cat, this
individual’s face was flatter as if a human being was trying to look
like a cat. It had whiskers and cat ears on top of its head. It did
not have green eyes. Stupidly my mind said, it does not hunt at dawn
and dusk. It does not stay out at night.</p>
<p>“We do not have much time, Detective Ronnie Camberwell” the alien said to me in accented basic.
This was not the meow-sounding speech of a Pantheran. “Do you have the
reports?”</p>
<p>I stared at the alien, speechless.</p>
<p>“I cannot read minds, Detective Camberwell,” the alien said. Its tone
was calm which was very odd. The transfer point was shaky. Alarms
continued to sound. Announcements repeated over and over.</p>
<p>“Reports?” I finally repeated. “Suri Iglesia has the archaeological reports. She
copied them from Heracles Beja.</p>
<p>It was the alien’s turn to be silent. I could not read the expression
on its face. Its whiskers were twitching.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about archaeological reports,” it finally said. “We
want the other reports you have.”</p>
<p>The transfer point rocked violently. We were both thrown to the
corridor floor. Then the gravity went off. More alarms sounded. More
instructions came over the loud speakers.</p>
<p>“Come with me,” the alien said. “The station is breaching everywhere.
We must get back aboard ship.”</p>
<p>I am a total loss at moving when there is no gravity. The alien knew
how and used its arms to pull us from handhold to handhold, eventually
getting us into an open area where it could launch itself from ceiling
to floor in a way that made sense. We were back in the docking ring.
We got aboard a spaceship and left Transfer Point Seventeen none too
soon. When we were fully clear of it, the space station blew up.</p>
<p>I saw this on the view screens in the control center of the spaceship.
I was strapped into an acceleration couch. The spaceship was going as
fast as it could toward a jump gate.</p>
<p>“Why did you blow up the transfer point,” I asked. I was glad to be
alive but I was certain I was a prisoner.</p>
<p>“We did not,” the alien, who appeared to be the captain, replied. “It
is coincidental that we arrived when the attack began.”</p>
<p>“I do not understand,” I said.</p>
<p>“We will explain everything to you when we are at cruising speed in
hyperspace,” the captain said. “Right now we need to concentrate on
getting clear before we are noticed.”</p>
<p>Their own language was rapid and in a low register. I could tell by
the view screens when we inserted into hyperspace. There were a number
of course corrections. Then there was quiet.</p>
<p>“We will go to our discussion room,” the captain said.</p>
<p>The captain and my rescuer detached themselves from their acceleration
couches. My rescuer detached me and assisted me in the weightless
spaceship to navigate to a very comfortable conference room.</p>
<p>“This cabin functions as our discussion room, our recreation room and
our dining area,” my rescuer said. “You can see our galley facility on
the far wall. We hope our fare will be eatable for you. Our medical
officer will do some tests to determine if it is and what can sustain
you if it is not.”</p>
<p>That sounded quite dire to me.</p>
<p>“We had not intended to take you off the transfer point,” the captain
explained. “However, the attack changed all that. It would have seemed
cruel to abandon you to your fate.”</p>
<p>“And what is my fate?” I asked. Starvation sounded like a possibility.
Test subject might be another prior to starvation.</p>
<p>“Your ‘fate’, as you put it, is up to you,” the captain said. “You are
not our prisoner. You are our guest.”</p>
<p>“Could we begin at the beginning?” I asked. “Do you have water? And
who are you and what do you want that you think I have?”</p>
<p>“I am Harnoff,” the captain said. “This is Janker. We are Tigerfu.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard of Tigerfu,” I said.</p>
<p>“It is a long story,” Janker said. “We will have time to go into our
history, but the short version is that we are people who once lived on
the world known as Planet X.”</p>
<p>“but you did not want the reports from Planet X,” I said.</p>
<p>“What reports?” Captain Harnoff asked. “I do not know about any
reports from Planet X.”</p>
<p>And so we began our exchange of information.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the shock of first being almost killed by Suri Iglesia
or the attack or the betrayal of Captain Star Runner or the
destruction of Transfer Point Seventeen or everything that had
happened or it had nothing to do with any of it. I liked these aliens.
They were kind and courteous. I could not eat most of their food, but
they were generous with what I could eat and the medical officer could
synthesize some vitamins and minerals to keep me going. She knew what
food stuffs of theirs I could eat when they reached civilization, as
she put it. I could thrive on their worlds. I liked that idea.</p>
<p>“We are engaged in responding to forces here in the Primary Arm,”
Captain Harnoff said. “We were not a part of the attack on the
transfer point. We believe that was initiated by the People of the
Rainbow Sky. They are old, very old, enemies of the Lystran Empire.”</p>
<p>“I did not think they were actively participating in the war,” I said.
“I thought they were trying to contain the People of the Golden Sun.”</p>
<p>“The propaganda the People of the Rainbow Sky put out is that they are
a benign elder race that only want to maintain the status quo,” Janker
said. “If we are fair, and it is often hard to be fair, the People of
the Rainbow Sky are more concerned with their own interests than that
of the rest of the Primary Arm. But of late, and I mean for several
centuries, they have become more active again. Even this would not
have been worrying except that they have revived their connection
lately with our old enemy, the Followers of the Stars.”</p>
<p>I stared at them.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>“the Followers of the Stars are in the western spiral arm,” I said. “I</dt><dd><p>personally have never met one of them, but I know several people who
have.”</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This intelligence surprised both of my new friends.</p>
<p>“Who?” Captain Harnoff asked.</p>
<p>I was frightened. They both realized this. Had I said too much?</p>
<p>“We are just surprised,” Janker said. “We are curious that the
Followers of the Stars had contact with outsiders.”</p>
<p>“People in the western spiral arm discovered a toxic chemical site
from a long-ago war,” I said. “One of those people was a
fuchsia-colored PPantheran,” I said. “We learned the site was from a
genocidal war against the Trollolu. The Pantheran, my on and off
lover, accepted a commission to go to the Primary Arm. I returned to
my own world.”</p>
<p>“We have heard of this fuchsia-colored pantheran,” Captain Harnoff
said. A Pantheran had not been seen in the Primary Arm for many
thousands of years.”</p>
<p>“Were they common here?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Our histories tell us so,” Janker said. “They are fearsome warriors.
They once were the pilots of all space faring vessels. They built the
original jump gates.”</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>“They were maintained by the People of the Rainbow Sky,” Harnoff said.</dt><dd><p>“I did a report on them for school when I was a juvenile. They were
introduced into the Primary Arm by the Followers of the Stars.”</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>“They were instrumental in driving us from our home world,” Janker
said.</p>
<p>“Our home world is the planet you call Planet X. The Followers of the
Stars took it over after we were driven out.”</p>
<p>“That was twenty thousand years ago, right?” I asked.</p>
<p>“About that,” Janker said. “How do you know? The People of the Rainbow
Sky and the Followers of the Stars have made great efforts to
eliminate even the knowledge of our race.”</p>
<p>“Because of the work Heracles Beja was doing there recently,” i said.
“He was analyzing pigment samples on a stone wall.”</p>
<p>“Are those the reports you were speaking  of?” Janker asked. “The ones
you thought I wanted.”</p>
<p>“Yes” I said. “What reports did you want.”</p>
<p>“Two men were killed on Transfer Point Seventeen,” Harnoff said. “An
unusual weapon was used.”</p>
<p>“No one was killed,” I said. “I investigated. No one knew who these
men were. They never existed. The weapon described was an
impossibility.”</p>
<p>Janker twisted his ears. I had already learned this was a negative.</p>
<p>“The weapon does exist,” he said. “That is why we want the reports.”</p>
<p>I shared what I had with them. They were quite excited and murmured
together over them for some time. I was very tired. I asked to be
excused.</p>
<p>The medical officer, her name was Suchee, showed me to a quiet and semi-private
space. I stretched out and began to cry. Suchee sat with me, making
low rumbling noises which I took to mean comfort.</p>
<p>“What is wrong?” Suchee finally asked when I had stopped crying.</p>
<p>“She left me to die,” I said.</p>
<p>“Who left you to die?” Suchee asked.</p>
<p>“Captain Star Runner,” I said. “She promised she would not leave
without me and she left me there to die. If Janker had not come
looking for me and took the time to save me, I would be dead. We were
not getting along very well. But that was no reason to let me die.”</p>
<p>“We do not know all the facts,” Suchee said. “I know you are
frightened and feeling all alone. Any reasonable person would feel
this way after what has happened to you. This is especially true of
humanoids in my experience. The only comforts I can give you are
these: You are safe here. We will make sure you can live somewhere
safe when we get back. Our route takes us deep into Tigerfu-controlled
space. There is no war going on there. The second thing I can tell you
is that without the facts, we do not know if Captain Star Runner left
voluntarily or not. It may not have been her desire to abandon you.
Perhaps she thought she could get back in time to save you. Perhaps she
thought you would be all right while she was away. The attack was
well-executed. It was a total surprise. We monitored all the
communications.”</p>
<p>“Was there any communication from Captain Star Runner?” I asked. It
was a silly thing. How would they know. Were they there at the right
time to find anything out?</p>
<p>“I will have Janker check,” Suchee said. “Can you give him some more
information?”</p>
<p>“I think I can,,” I said.</p>
<p>“Then we will look and see,” Suchee said.</p>
<p>And she left me alone to sleep.</p>
<p>When I awoke, Janker had some information for me.</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-nineteen-sitting-by-a-fountain">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Chapter Nineteen: Sitting by a Fountain</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-nineteen-sitting-by-a-fountain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Tigerfu brought me to a place they called the Habitat. This was a
large domed complex on a planet far from the war zone. My rescuers did
not bring me all the way here. Several different very kind Tigerfu
shepherd me on my journey. At all times they told me and treated me
ass their honored guest. I was touched by their consideration and
their gentle ways. It seemed strange to me that these quiet and
patient people were aggressors in a war.</p>
<p>I gained very little information on my long journey. They listened to
me tell my story of betrayal over and over. When I asked questions,
they told me I would have my questions answered when I reached the
Habitat.</p>
<p>I imagined the Habitat to be a complex space station, something like
Half Moon Bay Station, with myriad pods held together with rings of
docks for shipping. The reality was far nicer and a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>When I say the Habitat was a domed city, I am not quite accurate. It
is a series of domes, each of which can be self-sustaining if the
others breach. As a result, even the urban areas have large productive
gardens.</p>
<p>Consistent with their gentle ways, the Tigerfu decided to be
vegetarians. They grow their own food very carefully without undue
chemical interventions. Every Tigerfu learns how to cultivate a small
garden so that the entire race is able to step in to feed themselves
in case of disaster.</p>
<p>“Once, my teacher said, “we were a highly specialized society. When
our disaster came, we almost failed because so few of us knew the
basics. Food sufficiency was one of the core studies we decided to be
part of every Tigerfu juvenile’s education. We also added basic
programming and the use of hardware and software for communication.
Each Tigerfu must select a specialty. We monitor so that the
specialties are well-balanced. For example, we make sure we have
medics. We also make sure we have people to repair our domes, produce
potable water, process our waste. Sometimes our specialty choice is
turned down because we have so many with that specialty. We give
assign the juvenile to a needed specialty. If later they want to add
to their proficiency, we allow that, but they must maintain their
certification in their first core competency. It is a matter of pride
among us if we have certification in several areas.</p>
<p>“What about you? What are your specialties,” I asked. I had no doubt
he had more than one.</p>
<p>Gemall smiled. “I am a juvenile teacher, of course. My specialties are
water management and disaster relief. I work several weekends a year
in the public works section and I train regularly in disaster relief.
From time to time I go off planet to help in a natural disaster. There
were terrible floods on one planet three years ago.”</p>
<p>Gemall and I walked daily in the gardens. When Gemall was not
available, I walked with my Counselor, Dibenan. Both of these Tigerfu
spent many hours with me. When I was not with them, I had my own room,
arranged as I wished, with a large window overlooking a quiet
courtyard. There were benches and a fountain with a few potted growing
things. Some were vegetables while others had flowers. Vines were on
trellises overhead. The fountain added humidity to the air. The
plantings consumed carbon dioxide and returned oxygen. It was a
pleasant place to sit. The other residents of my building gave me
expressions of friendliness, but did not intrude. I ate with them at
the common meals. As they spoke in their own language and as my
ability to converse in it was still very minimal, I enjoyed their
company without participating in their interactions.</p>
<p>I learned these were students. It was thought that although they were
younger than I was, they could provide a supportive atmosphere and
interacting with me would be helpful to them as well.</p>
<p>In a way, I was a pedagogical tool. In another way, I could provide
value as part of the society and I appreciated the opportunity to give
in my limited way. Although the Tigerfu had a very good safety net,
they also expected everyone to contribute as they were able. If you
could contribute and did not,, you were shunned. Social pressure led
to conformance in many cases.</p>
<p>“Is there much crime here?” I asked Gemall one day.</p>
<p>“Some,” Gemall said. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“I am a police officer by training,” I said. “I have also done private
investigations and worked as a body guard. I was wondering if my skill
set is useful here.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gemall said. “I would like to tell you, as a member of a
different race, that we had no crime here, but you probably would not
believe me even if I said it.”</p>
<p>I smiled. Gemall and Dibenan were beginning to recognize this facial
expression. I was still woefully inadequate at reading Tigerfu body
language. They still needed to tell me when they were joking which
they did often.</p>
<p>“No, I would not believe that any society had gone past crime,” I
said. “Temptation, greed, pride–all what we humans called deadly
sins–seem to exist in all societies I know about except the Fungusian
Network.”</p>
<p>“No you are correct,” I said. “I would not believe you.”</p>
<p>Gemall made a gesture with her paw arms. I knew this was a smile. “You
will have to speak and understand Tigerfu much better before you can
operate in law enforcement.”</p>
<p>“I take your point,” I said. “I must redouble my efforts.”</p>
<p>Later that day Dibenan asked, “How are you finding living here among
us?”</p>
<p>I thought for a while, watching the fountain splash down on some
fantastical water creatures.</p>
<p>“I miss my home,” I said. “I miss my friends. And despite her
betrayal, I miss Star Runner. But missing them aside, I am quite
comfortable here.”</p>
<p>“But–” Counselor Dibenan prompted.</p>
<p>“But it is still very unreal,” I said. “It is like being in a movie. I
keep thinking it will end. I will find myself removed from my
residence, removed from knowing anyone like you or Gemall, and among
some brutish aliens where I cannot trust anyone.”</p>
<p>“Trust is a major issue for you,” Dibenan said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“It has been a major issue for you from your juvenile period. Yet,
from what you have told me, there have always been people who have
stepped in and renewed your trust in others. Mr. and Mrs. Parge raised
you when your parents could not, for example.”</p>
<p>“I have not made wise choices as an adult,” I said.</p>
<p>“Let us test that assertion,” Dibenan suggested.</p>
<p>“All right,” I said. “Let me provide you with a list and you tell me
what you think.”</p>
<p>“That is a good idea,” Dibenan said.</p>
<p>So I began:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Captain Star Runner</p></li>
<li><p>Tara Lee Harris</p></li>
<li><p>Gyllian Romeres-Lujo</p></li>
<li><p>Tamara</p></li>
<li><p>Josh</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I provided Dibenan with background on each of these and a few others
who are unknown to the readers of these chronicles.</p>
<p>Dibenan listened with her full attention, a common trait among
Tigerfu. She was quiet for some time. Like me, she studied the
fountain. Unlike me, she probably saw more of the essence of fountain
than I did.</p>
<p>“Relationships are much like this fountain,” she finally said. “There
is practicality. The fountain provides humidity. There is also beauty.
Sometimes the water catches the light just right and there are tiny
rainbows. We hear the sound of the splashing water and it soothes us.
I look at the sea creatures and remember our myths and legends about
them. This gives me joy and perhaps even a bit of sorrow that they are
fictional representations of greater truths.</p>
<p>“Relationships can also be annoying. The sound of water can become
irritating. The water can be cold and wet and make us uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>“Relationships are not all one way and not all one way all the time.
There are uncomfortable bits worked into joyful bits worked into
routine bits worked into sorrowful bits. They ebb and flow and
circulate like the water in this fountain.”</p>
<p>“Betrayal is like letting the plug out and all the water draining
out,” I said. “There is nothing beautiful in that.”</p>
<p>“Not beautiful exactly,” Dibenan said, “but sometimes it is necessary
to turn the fountain off, drain the water and thoroughly clean and
repair the fountain before starting it up again. Part of what I think
you need to wrestle with is possibilities.”</p>
<p>“But I do not want to–” I began.</p>
<p>“Hush now,” Dibenan said in her gentle way. “Tell me if any of these
individuals intended to betray you?”</p>
<p>I thought about this. I tried to think honestly about this.</p>
<p>“Having different goals, having different priorities from you is not
betrayal,” Dibenan continued. “Tara Lee, your former human lover,
wanted a monogamous lifelong relationship with you. You were unwilling
to give up your affection for Captain Star Runner and the excitement
of being with an alien in order to meet Tara Lee’s desires. You have
been in conflict with both Tamara and Gyllian Romeres-Lujo because of
their special relationship with Star Runner and with their different
objectives, their loyalties to different institutions.”</p>
<p>“You are painted me as quite a selfish person,” I said. I knew I
sounded petulant.</p>
<p>“Are you a selfish person?” Dibenan asked.</p>
<p>“I do not think so,” I said. “I have strong opinions about what I like
and I do not like.”</p>
<p>“Do you think of yourself as a negotiator, as a person who is willing
to change for the sake of another’s happiness or needs?”</p>
<p>I was silent. Dibenan did not speak while she waited for me to say
something.</p>
<p>“I have always wanted to be a police officer,” I said..  Both Mr. and
Mrs. Parge were very keen on what was right and what was wrong. Police
work can be very good for a person who likes the world ordered in that
way. They were very scandalized by my relationship with Captain Star
Runner. In their minds, associating with an alien in an intimate way
was obscene. Consorting with a Pantheran was disloyal to the human
race. I think I have always been afraid that their assessment of Star
Runner would be accurate.”</p>
<p>“And every time Star Runner behaves in a manner consistent with your
foster parents’ ideas about aliens and Pantherans in particular, you
pull back from your relationship,” Dibenan said.</p>
<p>“But Star Runner promised,” I said. “She promised not to leave me on
the transfer point.”</p>
<p>“Have you kept every promise you ever made?” Dibenan asked.</p>
<p>I did not answer her. Of course I had not kept every promise I ever
made. Who had?</p>
<p>“Unless you discover Captain Star Runner’s reason for leaving the
transfer point without you, you cannot know for certain. In our
teachings, the Tigerfu wise ones say we should always give the other
the benefit of the doubt. We should always imagine the other is
trustworthy and has failed due to circumstances beyond their control.
We try to find the most helpful explanation for someone else’s actions
or to find some good in what they did. If Captain Star Runner left
prior to the attack, perhaps Captain Star Runner is still alive. If
she had stayed, she might not have been able to rescue you and save
both of you. As it is, you are alive and very likely, Captain Star
Runner is, too.”</p>
<p>“But if she loved me, she would have stayed,” I said, tearing up
again.</p>
<p>Dibenan waited for me to get control over myself.</p>
<p>“And if you loved Captain Star Runner,” she asked in her soft voice,
“would you have left her ride and gone aboard Transfer Point
Seventeen with the Lystran woman?”</p>
<p>That was a very hard question. I did not answer Dibenan. We sat for a
time in silence. At last Dibenan said, “It is time for me to leave. I
will talk with you again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I watched her leave the courtyard by the gate onto the walkway between
buildings. She walked purposefully, not looking back. I wondered if I
had let her down. As a counselor, letting her down did not seem
possible. But as an individual, did she see me as a selfish, immature
alien who did not strive for the higher ethics the Tigerfu practiced?
I did not know. I would have to ask Gemall in the morning. Was it
possible that I held everyone else to a higher standard than I was
willing to set for myself?</p>
<p>Confused and with a heavy step, I left the courtyard, too, and
prepared for the evening meal.</p>
<p>As either penance or my first step on the path to better living, I
concentrated on the conversation around me and spoke a few words. I
was greeted with encouragement, appreciation and yes, some humor, at
my bad pronunciation and grammar. I think at one point I called our
plate of beautifully arranged and steamed vegetables engine grease.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chapter-twenty-visitors-come-to-the-habitat">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">Chapter Twenty: Visitors Come to the Habitat</a><a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-twenty-visitors-come-to-the-habitat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Armed with my decision to interact more with my new environment, I
explored the area around my living quarters and the park. I was living
on a campus. Schools of varying kinds operated here. Gemall advised me
not to go beyond the school grounds.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked. “Am I under house arrest?”</p>
<p>“You are not,” Gemall explained. “The problem is you are humanoid. We
are fighting a war against humanoids. Your identification clearly
labels you as not one of the races we are fighting, but people get
excited and they may not take time to correctly identify you.”</p>
<p>I was astonished. “From all you have told me, I thought the Tigerfu
were more enlightened than that.”</p>
<p>Gemall made the humor gesture. “We like to think we are,” he said.
“However, Tigerfu are no different than anyone else. We accept people
who look like us. We are suspicious of those who do not. You do not.”</p>
<p>“You spoke of my identification,” I said. “What is that?”</p>
<p>“The arm band you wear,” Gemall said. “We all wear them. It identifies
who you are over the net.”</p>
<p>“You have a net?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Gemall said. “We were wondering when you would ask about
it.”</p>
<p>“Who is we?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Dibenan, me and a few others that supervise your integration into our
society,” Gemall said.</p>
<p>“I do have a link,” I said. “It has not been integrated with your
net.”</p>
<p>“We are looking at that,” Gemall said. “So far we do not see a way to
connect the two of them.”</p>
<p>The armband could not directly interface with my brain as it is so
different than a Tigerfu brain. However the technologists were able to
fabricate an interface for me consisting of a screen I could carry
with me and I could speak to it. It was not as private as a
brain-connected link, but we set it up to understand basic galactic so
I could interface with it easily. It could also understand Tigerfu so
I could practice my language skills. If I slowed the speech down, I
could also understand most of what it said in Tigerfu. Many of the
sounds were hard to distinguish. Part of the problem for me is that
Tigerfu has some very high sounds and some very low sounds. They are
virtually beyond my ability to hear.</p>
<p>In my explorations, I found a lovely bistro</p>
<p>at the edge of campus. Gemall had explained that I had a modest
stipend which also covered my room and board”Every Tigerfu is entitled
to this stipend,” he explained. “We thought it was the simplest way to
allocate your expenses. Of course,” he added in his serious voice,
“you are expected to contribute to society as you are able.”</p>
<p>“I plan to do just that,” I said. “We have spoken about law
enforcement.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we have,” Gemall said. “We are exploring that and some related
possibilities.”</p>
<p>No matter how many additional questions i asked, I could not find out
more about this mysterious we or what related possibilities might
mean. When I brought the matter up with Dibenan, she only said that
“we” referred to a committee on which both she and Gemall were members
and related possibilities simply meant looking at tasks I had the
aptitude and interest to perform.</p>
<p>“That is still a ways down the path,” Dibenan had said. “You need to
be far more competent with your language skills and your grasp of
Tigerfu society.”</p>
<p>To this end, I walked into the bistro.</p>
<p>People of course noticed me. I selected a beverage and a popular
snack. I fumbled a great deal connecting my identity and its
associated financial identity to the payment system, but I managed it
after several tries. No one became impatient. I realized that in a
busy market my fumblings would annoy people. My alien status would
upset them. Gemall and Dibenan were right. I was nowhere near ready to take on Tigerfu society as a whole.</p>
<p>I carried my treats outside to a bench under a tree with large red
blossoms. To me, it had a delicate aroma. To the Tigerfu, it had an
overwhelming fragrance. The trees were prized for their fruit and so
they were common throughout the campus.</p>
<p>“Here you are, Ronnie,” a Tigerfu voice said.</p>
<p>I looked up. Two Tigerfu were approaching me. I did not recognize
them. To me, it is hard to tell one Tigerfu apart from another. I was
still  learning how to use my wearable link to read their
identification information. These two Tigerfu were military.</p>
<p>“We’re Janker and Suchee,” one of them said.</p>
<p>I of course got them mixed up. They made the humorous gesture and I
laughed. No one was offended thankfully.</p>
<p>I was delighted to see them and told them so.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here in the Habitat?” I asked you. “It is a long
way from the front.”</p>
<p>“We are on leave,” Suchee explained. “We came here to see our family.”</p>
<p>“The grandchildren are growing cubs,” Janker explained. “If we are away
too long, we hardly recognize them.”</p>
<p>“You are a couple, then?” I asked.</p>
<p>“For many years,” Janker said. “We have three grown cubs and four
grand cubs.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful” I said. “I had no idea.”</p>
<p>“We did not want to burden you with more than you could handle,”
Suchee said, sitting down next to me.</p>
<p>“Is the tree a problem?” I asked. “I know many find its blossoms very
strong.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are very strong,” Suchee said, “but they are one of the
scents of home. Janker and I have been sneezing a lot. Aboard ship we
have so much filtered out of our atmosphere. But we enjoy all these
scents so we just sneeze and delight in being home.”</p>
<p>Suchee patted my hand.</p>
<p>“We understand you are doing well here.”</p>
<p>“I am learning,” I said. I wondered if Janker and suchee had access to
the committee. If they did, they probably would not tell me. They had
not even told me they were a long-term mated pair.</p>
<p>“The committee thought it was best if we came to visit you,” Janker
began. “We have some news for you.”</p>
<p>What sort of news could this pair have for me? I was confused.</p>
<p>“We have word of your Captain Star Runner,” Suchee said. “I know her
well-being is important to you.”</p>
<p>Was it? I was no longer sure.</p>
<p>“I am in military intelligence,” Janker explained. “That was why we
came to Transfer Point Seventeen in the Lystran Empire. We were
tracking down a lead. It turns out you were the most expedient person
to ask. You had the reports we were looking for to add to our
intelligence.”</p>
<p>I frowned. “The reports were entirely bogus,” I said. “I do not
understand how they could have helped you.”</p>
<p>“The reports were not bogus,” Janker said.</p>
<p>“The men did not exist,” I said. “I could find no evidence concerning
them.”</p>
<p>“Oh, they were real enough,” Janker said. “They were agents of the
Followers of the Stars–not willingly, of course, but they were
feeding information to the Followers of the Stars. When the Followers
of the Stars had all the information they needed, the agents
self-terminated.”</p>
<p>“With the soul killer?” I asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>“Is that what you call it?” Janker asked, surprised.</p>
<p>“It seemed the only name for the brain disruption,” I said.</p>
<p>“It is a good name,” Janker said. “I should recommend it with credit
to you.”</p>
<p>“But why could not anyone give me any information about these men?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“They were totally forgettable people,” Janker said. “They were not to
make friends or stand out in any way. After their deaths, the records
were updated to eliminate them. With no proof, you were bound to
discount their existence.”</p>
<p>“Janker was very lucky,” Suchee said, patting my hand again. “You had
all the records.”</p>
<p>“And,” Janker said, “not to be too patronizing, you were storing them
in a way I could easily access them.”</p>
<p>“I thought my security was state-of-the-art,” I said a little
defensively.</p>
<p>“Not for us,” Janker said. He almost sounded like a Pantheran.</p>
<p>Speaking of Pantherans, I asked, “You said you had news of Captain
Star Runner.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Janker said. “She and her ship are in our custody.”</p>
<p>“You captured her ship?” I asked. “Why?”</p>
<p>“She was carrying some very important communications for the People of
the Rainbow Sky,” Janker said. “We learned this and intercepted her.
Wisely, she did not fight us but surrendered, believing we could not
crack the codes. We did.”</p>
<p>“Is Star Runner all right? What are you doing with her?”</p>
<p>“At present, we are evaluating Captain Star Runner and her artificial
intelligence,” Janker said. “Our code experts are going over the
programming. We have had to call in some biologists and zoologists as
well. It is a very complicated network.”</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?” I asked. “Captain Star Runner depends on
Christabel to survive.”</p>
<p>“Christabel?” Janker made a gesture indicating  confusion. It was a
gesture I had learned to read and was working to sign adequately.
Lacking an extra set of arms, it was quite difficult to execute but quite useful
to learn.</p>
<p>“Christabel is the name of the AI,” I said. “Christabel was built by
the Fungusian Network.”</p>
<p>“And the Fungusian network is a part of the Pantheran Empire,” Janker
said. He gestured uncertainty.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “The Fungusian network is outside the Coalition, the
group of races the Pantherans control. The Fungusian network is
independent. You might be able to contact them. They have no love of
the Pantherans.”</p>
<p>“but they designed Captain Star Runner’s network,” Janker said. “Why
would they do that?”</p>
<p>I executed the thinking, wait a little while, gesture badly. Should I
tell them what I knew? Would it help or hinder Captain Star Runner. As
a prisoner of the Tigerfu, I thought information might help her so I
plunged in.</p>
<p>A long time ago, the Followers of the Stars oversaw a number of races:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Trollolu</p></li>
<li><p>the Pantherans</p></li>
<li><p>the Featherote</p></li>
<li><p>the Fungusians</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Trollolu educated the three other races. Together, they built a
space faring consortium:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the Featherote built the ships.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fungusians designed the operating systems and software to
control them.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pantherans designed star runners to pilot them. They also
engineered other Pantherans to work other aspects of the ship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then the Trollolu went to war against the Followers of the Stars and
were completely annihilated. The Followers of the Stars retired from
the galactic scene and each of the remaining races continued their
alliance. The Pantherans became an empire, conquering the Featherote
and a number of other races. They call it a Coalition so that these
races can believe they were not conquered. The Fungusians have not
been conquered. They exist independently.</p>
<p>Janker and Suchee were indicating disagreement.</p>
<p>“What is wrong?” I asked. “Have I gotten something wrong? Do you know
this history?”</p>
<p>“We know some of it,” Janker said. “I will have to inquire from the
history department here on campus some of the particulars you mention.
These are unknown to me. Although I am a student of history, it is not
my core competencies. Here is where I think I disagree with your
conclusions.</p>
<p>“The Followers of the Stars did destroy the Trollolu. They nearly
destroyed the Tigerfu. When you say the Followers of the Stars retired
from political and military activity, they may have pulled back from
your galactic arm, but they continued to be active in this arm for
some time. They have also been absent from the scene, as you call it,
but they have reasserted themselves. They are working with their old
ally the People of the Rainbow Sky to control all the other races in
the Primary Arm. It seems the People of the Rainbow Sky felt
challenged by us and others and called on the Followers of the Stars
to help. Captain Star Runner has been their go-between. From our
initial analysis of the software aboard Captain Star Runner’s vessel,
she is definitely controlled by them.”</p>
<p>“There is pernicious software in her system?” I asked. I was shocked
the Fungusians had not identified it and I said so. “How is she being
compromised?”</p>
<p>“We have found the change logs,” Janker said. “The Fungusians are
meticulous. We can follow their work. It is a very different methodology
than ours, but our scientists can make sense of it. Then there are
other changes which are not so clear. These seem not to have been made
by the Fungusians.”</p>
<p>“Captain Star Runner said the People of the Rainbow Sky did an upgrade
to her and to the artificial intelligence. Star Runner said there was
some kind of genetic drift that had taken place that made it
deleterious to her to be in the presence of the People of the Rainbow
Sky. Star Runner could not see them properly, only colored hazes.”</p>
<p>“We thought it looked like their programming,” Janker said. “We could
not understand it. I will tell the biology team to investigate this.”</p>
<p>He spoke rapidly in Tigerfu and gestured just as quickly. I could not
really follow what he said, but I heard Star Runner’s name several
times.</p>
<p>“This is very useful intelligence,” Janker said to me. “What seems to
be very clear in that Captain Star Runner believes she is working
independently while in fact she is being controlled from the outside.
We are trying to figure out what to do. It is a serious ethical
question.”</p>
<p>“We hoped you might help us,” Suchee said. She continued to touch my
hand. “You have intimate knowledge of Captain Star Runner and may help
us chart the right response to this situation.”</p>
<p>“You are free to say no,” Janker hastened to add. “As much as we would
like your help, you, too, are a free agent. We recognize that you may
not want to help or be involved with Captain Star Runner anymore.”</p>
<p>“We do not need an answer right away,” Suchee said. “You can think
about it for a little while. Janker,” she made a gesture of affection,
“wants an answer right away–you can understand this, I think–but in
reality it can wait for a few days.”</p>
<p>We said some inconsequential things after this. Then they went away. I
continued to sit on the bench and tried to think and sort out my
emotional response to all of this. I was not surprised when Dibenan
sat down next to me with another beverage and  more substantial food.”</p>
<p>“You missed the midday meal,” she said. “I would think you would be
hungry.”</p>
<p>“I have been trying to figure out what to say to Janker,” I said,
fully believing Dibenan had been updated.</p>
<p>“And what have you been thinking?” Dibenan asked.</p>
<p>“I am first trying to really understand the overall situation,” I
said. “With Captain Star Runner’s explanations, I believed the People
of the Rainbow Sky were the good guys here. There is another component
called the People of the Golden Sun who are the bad guys.”</p>
<p>“There is no group called the People of the Golden Sun,” Dibenan said.
“They do not exist. They are an invention of the People of the Rainbow
Sky.”</p>
<p>“But Captain Star Runner was captured by the People of the Golden Sun
and fought a battle against them. She was decorated for her work.”</p>
<p>Dibenan was silent. I realized she was reaching out to the net.</p>
<p>“The People of the Rainbow Sky invented the People of the Golden Sun
for propaganda purposes,” Dibenan said. “it is an excuse for war. It
is an excuse to rally worlds that have been increasingly restless
under burdens of taxation and tribute.”</p>
<p>“It was quite real when Transfer Point Seventeen was blown up,” I
said.</p>
<p>“The war itself is real,” Dibenan said.</p>
<p>“And the attack against the Rabbit merchants?”</p>
<p>“We had reached out to them to join us,” Dibenan said. “The People of
the Rainbow Sky destroyed their planet.”</p>
<p>I thought my brain was going to explode. All this contradictory
information.</p>
<p>“It is a matter of trust, is it not?” I asked Dibenan. “You and I have
talked a lot about trust. Have you been trying to sway me to your side
or have you honestly wanted me to explore this topic?”</p>
<p>Dibenan made a gesture of surprise and, I thought, chagrin.</p>
<p>“You can be very perceptive,” she said. “You cannot function in our
society without trust. You find it difficult to trust. We have talked
about that and I think you will agree my points have merit. There is
probably no real way to ascertain who is telling you the truth about
the bigger picture. We cannot fact check for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“And Captain Star Runner? What is the ethical issue there?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We have always thought of ungendered Pantherans as creatures,”
Dibenan said. “They are controlled by their artificial intelligences.
If you control the artificial intelligence, you control them. They
function in a network.</p>
<p>“But here we have Captain Star Runner. Although she, more properly it,
must have access to an artificial intelligence for some basic
biological monitoring and memory management, this Pantheran is
functioning independently. There is no supervision of this creature’s
decision-making except for the patches added by the People of the
Rainbow Sky. This might mean that this Pantheran is not a creature but
a person. The fact that you and Captain Star Runner had or have a
relationship speaks to the Pantheran’s person hood.”</p>
<p>I knew I was making an irrevocable decision. I knew there would be no
turning back. But I also knew a number of disparate pieces of my life
were coming together.</p>
<p>I said, “Captain Star Runner is a fuchsia-colored Pantheran. These are
rare in their history. Most ungendered Pantherans are pastel-colored.
Fuchsia-colored panther ans have always made a significant impact on
panther an society. Captain Star Runner has always wondered what” (I
almost said her, but I decided to give Captain Star Runner its own
preferred pronoun) its mission is. I think it is to demonstrate that
ungendered panther ans can be people. They can have self-determination.
They are not tools to be discarded.”</p>
<p>“I will pass your sentiments on to the team evaluating Captain Star
Runner,” Dibenan said, making ready to get up from the bench.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “I will join the team. I want to speak with Captain Star
Runner. It will need to participate in its own rehabilitation. The
Fungusian network will also have to be contacted to assist with any
changes that need to be made to Christabel. We have an opportunity
here. I do not want it to be wasted.”</p>
<p>Dibenan was taken aback. I knew that I had never been this forceful or
definitive around her. But she also made a gesture of pleasure and
acknowledgement.</p>
<p>“Well done,” she said. “I will put your recommendations forward as
well as your desire to be on the team.”</p>
<p>“Not my desire,” I said. “My insistence.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” Dibenan said.</p>
<p>I thought my request would be denied. I thought the bureaucracy would
take forever. I was wrong.</p>
<p>“Your application for membership on Captain Star Runner’s team has
been accepted,” Gemall told me the next day. “You will travel with
Janker and Suchee. Janker is already a member of the team. Suchee has
been reassigned to assist you in any way necessary. We also anticipate
Captain Star Runner will need help adjusting as well. If all goes
according to plan, you will both come back here at a later date. The
Habitat is a good location for integrating into our society.”</p>
<p>“No,” i said. “Captain Star Runner will not come here. This is a
planet with great expanses under the dome. Captain Star Runner needs
to be aboard its ride, integrated with its artificial intelligence.
When Captain Star Runner travels out of range of a good working
integration with the artificial intelligence, it must use a bridge AI.
It is less than satisfactory. Also a method for maintaining Captain
Star Runner’s mind and body needs to be planet side. it is all quite
complicated and quite alien to it. Star runners are designed to be
part of their rides. In a real sense, the ride is a part of them. it
is a shell that can be changed, much like animals who grow and shed
their shells and skins, but they need their rides. If Captain Star
Runner is to be a person, it must needs to be aboard its ride and actively traveling on the space ways. Any other
life would not be natural.”</p>
<p>Gemall was silent.</p>
<p>“I had not understood that,” Gemall said. “You need to compose a
statement about this to the rest of the team. They are not thinking
this way as I understand it. You will have a great impact.”</p>
<p>“Or I will be ignored,” I said, having a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>“No, I do not think so,” Gemall said. “Janker and Suchee are very
positive about your contributions. The scientists are not ideologues.
They are just interested in the science and,” Gemall made a gesture of
emphasis “and they do not want to do any harm whether to a person or a
creature.”</p>
<p>And so it was that I left the Habitat several days later with Janker
and Suchee and traveled to where Captain Star Runner was being held.
Along the way, Janker told me more of what he had learned.</p>
<p>“We are going to a research facility,” he told me in the common room
aboard our military fast ship. Military fast ships are small vessels
which ferry military personnel from one place to another inside
Tigerfu space. They are not heavily armed. Their function is speed.
“Captain Star Runner is aboard its ship, but we have disabled the
engines. My latest report is that it is quite agitated and believes
our questions and examinations are intrusive and meant to disable it.”</p>
<p>“If you thought you were being held prisoner,” I said, “You would
think the same things. This would be especially true if you believed
you were being held by the enemy.”</p>
<p>“That is the odd thing,” Janker said. “We are not convinced Captain
Star Runner thinks we are the enemy.”</p>
<p>“But I thought you said, or someone said, Captain Star Runner has
patches from the People of the Rainbow Sky that control it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, in some regards, but the work that has been done most recently
suggests these patches are very specific and do not affect Captain
Star Runner’s overall thinking. We are hoping that you can sort a lot
of this out for us. Captain Star Runner has not been very forthcoming
to us.”</p>
<p>“have you learned where Captain Star Runner went after it left
Transfer Point Seventeen?” I asked. “I would like to get clear about
that before I see it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we do,” Janker said. “That has to do with the patch. The
Pantheran received a communication from someone it knew from its
previous visit to the Blue Fire Star System, one Sam lam Seah. Captain
Star Runner could not resist the summons so it went. The summons
removed Captain Star Runner from the area of Transfer Point Seventeen
and thus kept it safe when the transfer point exploded. The summons
was real enough. We intercepted Captain Star Runner after its visit to
the Blue Fire Star System.”</p>
<p>“And we suspect,” Suchee added, “that leaving you behind was something
Captain Star Runner had no control over.”</p>
<p>“Nor did your presence aboard Captain Star Runner’s ship known to the
People of the Rainbow Sky. Retrieving you was not part of the
summons,” Janker explained. “If it was, you would not have been left
there. Captain Star Runner has been very distressed about you.”</p>
<p>“Have you told it I am alive and well?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Janker said.</p>
<p>I make Tigerfu gestures badly, but I deliberately made my gesture of
anger slowly and carefully.</p>
<p>“That is cruel,” I said. “You tell Captain Star Runner immediately
that I am well and looking forward to visiting it. Causing needless
distress is unethical behavior.”</p>
<p>Janker made a gesture of contrition and sorrow. “You are correct,” he
said. “I deeply regret our behavior. Our only defense is that we did
not know if you wished to be revealed to the Pantheran. We will
correct this immediately.”</p>
<p>During my next rest period, I lay awake in my bunk, wondering what
this reunion would be like. I was adamant that Captain Star Runner
should be treated like the person
it was. I was less sure how i wanted our personal interactions to be?
Were we still lovers? Was I just a friend? Had I become Captain Star
Runner’s advocate?</p>
<p>Maybe, I thought, it was not as important as I once thought it was to
distinguish these three roles. What was important right now was doing
the right thing, the ethical thing, for Captain Star Runner. After I
did that, maybe I would never see it again. Maybe I would just return
to the Habitat and find some meaningful work to do.</p>
<p>As I fell asleep, I thought, the Tigerfu had already won me over. I
was thinking and acting in a very different way than I ever had
before. I hoped I would be happy with myself when I was finished with
this project.

</ol>
</div>
<p>I was anxious to see Captain Star Runner. The software engineers were
busy on another project so Janker, Suchee and I left them to their
work and made our way to the docking ring where Captain Star Runner’s
ride was quarantined.</p>
<p>When we approach it, Janker took out his override. I touched his hand
arm which held the device.</p>
<p>“We should ask permission to go aboard,” I said. “If Captain Star
Runner is a person, that is the polite and respectful thing to do.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” Janker said, putting the override device back into his
pouch.</p>
<p>Since Tigerfu have fur and do not wear clothing, pouches are the
preferred way of carrying gear around. Some Tigerfu use vests. Others
have adopted wearing backpacks. There are very conventional designs
for these adaptations and there are trendy ones as well. I use a
cross-body bag.</p>
<p>I went to the ride hatch and placed my palm against the reader.</p>
<p>“Permission to come aboard,” I said.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>“Have you disabled this feature?” I asked Janker.</p>
<p>“I do not know,” he said and contacted one of the software engineers.
“She says no,” Janker reported.</p>
<p>I tried again. “Please respond,” I said.</p>
<p>Again nothing happened.</p>
<p>“We should go in,” Suchee said. “Perhaps there is a medical
emergency.”</p>
<p>“Christabel should have responded the second time,” I said, making a
gesture of concern.</p>
<p>Janker overrode the door.</p>
<p>The ride smelled stale. Something was wrong with the air r cleansers.
Janker made a note. We hurried to the control center.</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner lay sprawled on its pedestal. For a moment I
thought it was dead. Then it struggled to open one eye. Its lips moved
but no sound came out. I hurried to its die.</p>
<p>Janker went over quickly to a control panel that had recently been
installed. Suchee reached in her pouch for a medical scanner. There
were gestures of concern all around.</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner’s mouth formed a word. I could not tell what it
was.</p>
<p>“Its dehydrated,” Suchee said.</p>
<p>“The artificial intelligence is not active,” Janker said.</p>
<p>“Then all of Captain Star Runner’s bio systems are not being
maintained,” i said.</p>
<p>“I will bring the software engineers in immediately,” Janker said.</p>
<p>There was a flurry of activity.</p>
<p>“We are not certain what is wrong,” Janker reported.</p>
<p>Suchee had several interventions drips going. She was consulting
previous readings to adjust treatment.</p>
<p>I wanted to stay with Captain Star Runner, but an idea had come to me
concerning its state and Christabel’s state as well. I went to the
cargo area of the ride and began reading all the displays I could
find. After reading half a dozen, I ran back to the control center,
furious.</p>
<p>Janker and Suchee were startled by my gestures of anger heightened by
the gesture of extremity.</p>
<p>“No wonder both Christabel and Captain Star Runner are nearly dead,” I
said. “I thought you said you were treating them well and
respectfully.”</p>
<p>“We are,” Janker said. For a Tigerfu, he was stammering.</p>
<p>“Hardly,” I said. “Both Christabel and Captain Star Runner require
nutrients. They are both bio systems. There’s no food for either of
them on this ride. Many of the nutrient tanks are empty or close to
it.”</p>
<p>“Do you have a list of requirements?” Janker asked immediately,
pulling out his communication link.</p>
<p>“The tanks are clearly labeled with requirements,” I said. “I will
show you.”</p>
<p>No permanent damage was done. Supplies arrived quickly. Janker
personally supervised the operation and double-checked by hand all the
conversions from standard basic galactic measurements to Tigerfu ones.
He also initiated an inquiry as to why ship’s stores were not
inventoried and replenished as needed.</p>
<p>Christabel recovered quickly. From the Tigerfu control panel, Janker
reported that she was running repair programs for damaged areas.</p>
<p>“The memory banks are unaffected,” he reported. He made a gesture of
humor. “Our overrides suffered, but that is to be expected. We have
put them back in place.”</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner slept peacefully. I sat on the pedestal, stroking
its shoulder occasionally. I could feel its rhythmic breathing.</p>
<p>“Christabel,” I said.</p>
<p>“I am here,” Christabel responded.</p>
<p>“Why did you not ask for supplies,” I queried.</p>
<p>“Captain Star Runner did not wish to interact with the enemy.”she
answered.</p>
<p>“Do you both think of the Tigerfu as the enemy?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We do They have captured us and installed unwanted software in my
system.”</p>
<p>“Do you know about the patches the People of the Rainbow Sky put into
your programming?” I asked.</p>
<p>“These patches came with the software upgrade I received   when we
were in the Royal Cains Star System,” Christabel said.</p>
<p>“These patches control you and leave you vulnerable to errors in
judgment,” I pointed out. “The software engineers plan to remove them
immediately because they caused you to refrain from requesting needed
supplies which wold have been provided had you asked.”</p>
<p>“I have no reason to believe they would have been provided,”
Christabel responded. “It is clear you are being controlled by the
Tigerfu and have become a willing mouthpiece for them.”</p>
<p>She closed communications with me. I rarely hear the communication
link shut down. I heard it then. Click. Christabel was finished
speaking with me.</p>
<p>“We have finally isolated the patches,” Janker said not too long
later.</p>
<p>“The problem is,” I said, “that you can clean up Christabel’s code,
but you will not be able to rewire Captain Star Runner. I am hoping
either it or Christabel will be able to discuss Pantheran engineering
which caused Captain Star Runner to choose self-termination rather
than cooperation. As you both know, Captain Star Runner went to great
lengths to avoid termination when it was declared surplus.”</p>
<p>“Because Captain Star Runner did that,” Suchee said, “we know its
biological imperative for life was functioning properly. Either there
is a patch we have not found yet or the artificial intelligence
overrode or negated its will to live. Personally, I think it fought
the artificial intelligence as much as it could, but did not have the
strength to continue the battle.”</p>
<p>“It also may be that this artificial intelligence is much stronger
than the one Captain Star Runner had when it resisted its termination
directive,” Janker said. “With a more conversational artificial
intelligence with as much bio programming as this one, it could be a
matter of personalities. It may be a refinement we need to consider. I
am seriously considering your suggestion to contact the Fungusian
Network. I am waiting for a report before I make that step. I will
also speak strongly,” he made a strength gesture here, “that we cannot
let anything like this debacle happen again. We value intelligent
life too highly to be in this position of neglect ever again. We will
officially apologize,” he made a gesture of deep regret, “to Captain
Star Runner when it recovers fully.”</p>
<p>From time to time I went to check on the revitalization of Captain
Star Runner’s ride. As Janker and his team removed layer after layer
of invasive code, more ride systems came on line. Cleaners turned on.
The air refreshed. Subroutines came alive to generate ship chandler
requests. As the requests were generated, they were given priority
aboard the research station. Deliveries arrived. There were even
requests for both human and Tigerfu food stuffs and necessities. The
Tigerfu, according to the orders being placed, were welcome guests.</p>
<p>I brought my things aboard the ride. It was a bold move on my part.
Perhaps I would have to pack them again and relocate off the ride, but
I wanted to get some sleep and I also wanted to be available when
Captain Star Runner could talk. I left a request to be contacted and a
request to see Captain Star Runner with Janker. I was surprised he was
not taking a rest period, but he said the work demanded his attention.
He could, and these were his words, catnap which would help him
continue for a while. Suchee commandeered a stateroom to get some rest, but left word to
be contacted
as soon as Captain Star Runner awoke or if its condition changed
radically.</p>
<p>i woke at my usual time and went into the galley. I could have ordered
food in my stateroom, but I decided it would be more sociable and
normal to go to the galley. I rummaged about, reviewed the automatic
cooker’s selections and made my choices. I was surprised to see
popular Tigerfu morning meal choices available as well.</p>
<p>Suchee padded in.</p>
<p>“The cooker makes a reasonable Tigerfu breakfast,” she said. “The
algorithm could be tweaked a bit, but for a first try it was quite
edible.”</p>
<p>“Did your people program it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Suchee said. “This is the work of the artificial intelligence. I
wonder where it got the algorithm from.”</p>
<p>“It most likely bought the recipe program,” I said. “If you have
removed the patches, it would be the logical thing to do. One of
Captain Star Runner’s business models is ferrying people from place to
place. When in Tigerfu space, provide for Tigerfu. Correcting the
algorithms for the food will be very important.”</p>
<p>“I can help with that,” Suchee said. “My son is a chef back in the
Habitat. I think I can ask him to share as part of our apology.”</p>
<p>“What I cannot understand,” I said, “is how the software engineers
overlooked this situation.”</p>
<p>“Janker has determined that they never considered the possibility,”
Suchee said. “Their protocols are being updated.” She brought a
beverage to the table where I was sitting. “Besides, those engineers
only send out for fast food. They probably assumed Captain Star Runner
would do the same. Totally irresponsible,” she added with a gesture of
emphasis and what humans would call a shrug of the shoulders.
“irresponsible for others and for themselves. They should eat
properly.”</p>
<p>“Spoken as a mother and a medical officer,” I said.</p>
<p>Suchee made a gesture of strong agreement.</p>
<p>I spoke to Captain Star Runner in the afternoon.</p>
<p>“You are alive,” it said with some wonder.</p>
<p>“And so are you,” I said.</p>
<p>“How?” it asked.</p>
<p>“The Tigerfu came along to Transfer Point Seventeen and rescued me.”</p>
<p>“And you came along and rescued Christabel and me,” Captain Star
Runner said.</p>
<p>“Thankfully Suchee and Janker knew what to do,” I said.</p>
<p>“but you figured it out,” Captain Star Runner said, resting its paw on
my hand. “That was very clever of you.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I am clever,” I said.</p>
<p>“I am not so clever,” Captain Star Runner said. I could not decide if
it spoke with regret, wistfulness or embarrassment.</p>
<p>“It is not your fault,” I said. “You were being controlled by outside
forces.”</p>
<p>“I could not tell,” Captain Star Runner said. It sighed.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we cannot,” I said. “It is not your fault.”</p>
<p>“I could be infected right now with another bad patch,” Star Runner
said. “I would not know.”</p>
<p>I did not know what to say to that.</p>
<p>“I can tell you my experience with the Tigerfu,” I said. “They rescued
me. They comforted me. They counseled me and they taught me. I can
make my own decisions, as far as I can tell, and they help me act on
them. After all, I am here with you and they have listened to my
suggestions and my outrage about how you were treated.”</p>
<p>“What will happen to me?” Star Runner asked. “I am a prisoner here.”</p>
<p>“You were captured because of the information you were carrying,” I
explained. “Because of who you are and your relationship to me, you
are not being held responsible for the intrusive programming attached
unbeknownst to you to your systems. When your systems have been
restored, you will be free to go.”</p>
<p>“Go where?” Star Runner asked. There was a definite feline plaintive
note to its voice.</p>
<p>“The Tigerfu have some ideas about that,” I said “When you are feeling
better, they want to discuss that with you. Right now they are
contacting the Fungusian network to see to Christabel. She was able to
override some of your thinking process and survival instincts. Janker
and the others, me included, are very worried about this.”</p>
<p>“Me, too,” Star Runner said.</p>
<p>Christabel remained silent. She had not spoken to anyone in hours,
including Captain Star Runner. Suchee reported that all of Captain
Star Runner’s bio systems were being cared for properly, but the
usually chatty artificial intelligence was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Janker came in. He had been resting.He made a gesture of respect
toward Captain Star Runner.</p>
<p>“This is Janker,” I said to Captain Star Runner. “He is the one who
rescued me from Transfer Point Seventeen on his own authority. He
works in Intelligence in the Tigerfu military. He has just made a
gesture of respect toward you.”</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner did not say anything which surprised me.</p>
<p>“With your permission,” Janker said, “the software engineers want to
restart all the computer systems on your vessel, including your
artificial intelligence. We want to make certain this will cause you
no distress.”</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner remained silent.</p>
<p>I said, “Unless Captain Star Runner says specifically not to, I would
think your restart is reasonable. Have you checked Captain Star
Runner’s mini artificial intelligence? Can it be pressed into service
if something goes wrong?”</p>
<p>Janker made a gesture of approval. “An excellent suggestion,
Detective. I will confirm the mini artificial intelligence is
prepared.”</p>
<p>Janker left the control center.</p>
<p>I said to Captain Star Runner, “Why did you not respond to Janker.”</p>
<p>“What would be the point?” Star Runner asked. “He would do what he
wanted to do anyway.”</p>
<p>I was about to argue with it when I thought about what Dibenan might
say. I wished she was here. She could be helpful. Then I also
remembered that Dibenan might say I could be just as helpful and that
participation in society and friendship with Star Runner required me
to be helpful.</p>
<p>“Janker wants to help,” I said.</p>
<p>“Janker wants intelligence,” Star Runner said. “Rehabilitating me will
advance his career. Establishing a positive relationship with the
Fungusian network will help his career. You and I are not important to
him.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?” I asked, trying to keep any emotion or
judgment out of my voice.</p>
<p>“It is why anyone does anything,” Star Runner said.</p>
<p>This response flummoxed me. I had never heard Star Runner speak like
this. Oh yes, Star Runner is all about self-promotion and and seeing
the universe from a particular point of view, but this Star Runner was
unknown to me.</p>
<p>“You seem surprised at this,” Star Runner continued. “If I look back
on all my relationships with terries, it is clear to me that they were
all for the benefit of the terries.”</p>
<p>I knew this was not true at all. I was about to say this when I
realized this viewpoint could only be coming from the People of the
Rainbow Sky. They were trying to drive a wedge between Captain Star
Runner and everyone else except themselves.</p>
<p>“What about Salim and Pru Dillow?” I asked. “Were they out for
themselves as well, especially in Sanctuary Eleven?”</p>
<p>If there was anything left of the Captain Star runner I knew it would
jump to the defense of Pru Dillow and Salim.</p>
<p>“I was useful to them,” Star Runner said. Its tone continued to be
dull as if all emotion had been bled away from the fuchsia-colored
panther an.</p>
<p>I tried once more.</p>
<p>“And what of Tamara?”</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner did not reply. I waited. If it rejected Tamara as
a friend, then I was certain the Pantheran I knew had been
obliterated.</p>
<p>“Tamara is–” Captain Star Runner did not finish the sentence. A
painful expression came over its face. It began to tremble and
whimper.</p>
<p>“Suchee,” I called. “Come quick. Captain Star Runner is in trouble.”</p>
<p>Suchee came immediately and began her scans.</p>
<p>“I am going to sedate Captain Star Runner,” she said, following her
words with actions. “It is in great distress.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Janker ran into the control center.</p>
<p>“The Pantheran is in pain,” Suchee said. “I cannot find a physical
cause.”</p>
<p>“There is no physical cause, not directly,” I said. “It is software.
It is blocking Star Runner’s thoughts and emotions toward other people
who have been important to it over the years. When I asked it about
its best friend, its expression turned to one of intense pain.”</p>
<p>Janker swore through gestures of rage and frustration.</p>
<p>“More interference,” he said. “We have to shut down the artificial
intelligence to see if it corrects the problem. Suchee, do you have
everything on hand to sustain Captain Star Runner?”</p>
<p>“I will in a little while,” Suchee said. And to me, “Ronnie, can you
monitor and let me know if there is a problem?”</p>
<p>She gave me a device. “If anything goes over this line, contact me.”</p>
<p>She left the control center.</p>
<p>When she returned–thankfully nothing had gone over the line she had
indicated–Janker shut Christabel down. The spaceship became
absolutely silent except for our breathing. Then I heard the
refrigeration units start up.</p>
<p>“The ship is running on redundant mechanical systems,” Janker
reported. “Because we are tied into station power, we will be fine.
The ship is not traveling anywhere. We have it locked in place. Unless
there is a massive power interrupt on the station, all will be well.
Right now I am waiting for all memory to be released. Then I have to
run extensive diagnostics. This will take some time.”</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner shifted position, rubbed its muzzle.</p>
<p>“Ronnie,” it said. “What is going on?”</p>
<p>I related what Janker had said and summarized our current status.</p>
<p>“So these Tigerfu are helping me regain control of my ride?” Captain
Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Had you lost control?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” Captain Star Runner said. “I just felt my thinking was a
bit fuzzy. I could not form complete thoughts. I was more reacting to
directives than making decisions.”</p>
<p>“Do you know when this began happening to you?”” Suchee asked.</p>
<p>“Let me think,” Star Runner said. “I do not know if I have all the
information. My extensive memory banks are shut down currently.”</p>
<p>Then Star Runner said, “I think I was all right before I got the call
to go to the Blue Fire Star System. I routed through the Royal Cains
Star System and my systems were gone over. Then,” it paused. “Then I
do not know. I have a blank there. Then I was traveling to to a base
somewhere.”</p>
<p>“Do you know where?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I have coordinates,” Star Runner said. “I can give them to you. I do
not know exactly–” it trailed off. Then it shook itself all over and
said something in panther an. I do not know Pantheran, but I know the
tone. It was a curse of some sort. “Write this down,” Star Runner said
emphatically. Suchee took down the coordinates. Janker passed them on
to Intelligence Headquarters.</p>
<p>Star Runner shook itself again and began to wash. There was something
impassioned about the activity, as if some dirt needed to be removed.
There was none. Washing was a practical activity for a Pantheran, but
it also was comforting and had many ritualistic overtones. Suchee and
I tried communicated with gestures. My gesture language was limited,
but we agreed Star Runner was cleansing something away.</p>
<p>“Ready for start up,” Janker said. “Captain Star Runner, are you
ready.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Janker, I am,” Captain Star Runner replied. “Be prepared to shut
down the system if I tell you to. That infection has left an awful
taste in my mouth as the terries would say. I do not know if you have
a similar expression.”</p>
<p>“We do,” Janker said.</p>
<p>I hugged Captain Star Runner around its neck. “So you are free of it
now?”</p>
<p>“I believe so, thanks to all of you,” Captain Star Runner said.</p>
<p>Janker brought Christabel back on line along with all the ride systems
she and Captain Star Runner controlled.</p>
<p>“Disconnect,” Captain Star Runner said. Its voice was harsh and
strained.</p>
<p>Janker shut the system down.</p>
<p>“What is wrong?” Janker asked.</p>
<p>“My system was being invaded with thoughts that are not my own,”
Captain Star Runner said. “Being awake, I can recognize them as alien
to myself. I was unconscious when everything was brought back on line.”</p>
<p>Janker made a gesture of disquietude. “The software engineers thought
the system was clean,” he said”It is not,” Captain Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“What can we do?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We need to speak with the Fungusians,” Captain Star Runner said. “I
hope they can cleanse the system.”</p>
<p>“I will need to escalate my request,” Janker said. “Unfortunately, we
are at a great distance from the Fungusian Network here. The
hyperspace routing is complex.”</p>
<p>“Is there a way for me to access the hyperspace routing tables?”
Captain Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>Janker gave a gesture of extreme surprise bordering on fear.</p>
<p>“Create a table off line,” Captain Star Runner instructed. There was
total confidence in its manner. This was the Captain Star Runner I
knew. “I will review it and reroute the communications. I assume you
were able to extract all my insertion and extraction points from memory
prior to the shut downs you have done?”</p>
<p>Janker remained still and quiet.</p>
<p>“You would not be a very valuable intelligence officer if you did
not,” Captain Star Runner said. “With a complete table, I can expedite
your request and if I make it and support your request, it is far more
likely that the Fungusians will respond. I have a contract with them
which is quite costly. Maintenance and warranties apply here as well
as a possible exchange of knowledge. What you found infecting my
system and what continues to infect it will be of great interest to
the Fungusians.”</p>
<p>With a trembling gesture which showed how much anxiety Janker felt, he
accepted Captain Star Runner’s offer on his own authority.Later Suchee
said to me, “Janker is putting a great deal of trust in your support
of Captain Star Runner. I hope his trust is not misplaced.”</p>
<p>“It is not,” I said though I, too, was frightened. The People of the
Rainbow Sky were powerful. We hoped they had not infected the
Fungusian network.</p>
<p>it was slow work. Captain Star Runner had to learn how to use the
routing tables designed by the Tigerfu. Being people with paw hands as
well as fingered ones, they had an interface Star Runner could use with
its paws which helped a great deal. Very tired, rubbing its eyes
with its paws, Star Runner said, “That will do it.”</p>
<p>“How long will it take?” Janker asked.</p>
<p>“Five of your days,” Star Runner said, “down from your estimate of
fifteen. I have used every communications shortcut I could find.”</p>
<p>“We have to check your work and review the message,” Janker said,
making a gesture of apology.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Captain Star Runner said. “I wrote it in very simple
basic galactic for that reason. There are no special codes. No flags.
My contract number is also in plain text. I have recommended some
methods of encryption I know can be decoded.”</p>
<p>“We are familiar with the Space Traders Guild protocols,” Janker said.
“That is a good choice.”</p>
<p>“thank you,” Captain Star Runner said.</p>
<p>Janker and Suchee prepared to leave the ride. I stayed in the control
center with Captain Star Runner.</p>
<p>“I hope coming aboard and moving in is acceptable to you,” I said. “I
will leave if you want me to.”</p>
<p>“Please stay,” Captain Star Runner said. “We need to talk.”</p>
<p>“How will you manage with Christabel shut down?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I have requested the medical officer tend me,” Captain Star Runner
said. “Suchee has agreed. We have set up a schedule. Janker will
provide me with a link like you have designed for someone who can only
use their paws to work it. I will have to move about the ride to
review my systems but that will not be a hardship. We might even be
able to leave the ride for a visit to the station. Perhaps they will
let us sample the Tigerfu cuisine. Would you like that?”</p>
<p>“There are some very nice Tigerfu dishes that I have had,” I said. “I
have not been to any restaurants off the campus where I was staying in
the Habitat, but what I have tasted it quite acceptable.”</p>
<p>“Very good. We will wait and see. Right now, I am very tired.”</p>
<p>“Get some rest,” I said, stroking its back. “I will talk to you
later.”</p>

<p>While we all waited for a reply from the Fungusian Network, life
aboard Captain Star Runner’s ride proceeded at a very slow and
leisurely speed. Captain Star Runner slept a lot. When it awoke, it
got down from the pedestal and moved about the ride.</p>
<p>“Were you trained to inspect your ride this way?” I asked Star Runner
on the third day.</p>
<p>“As a matter of fact I was,” Star Runner replied. “I was selected for
the military,but lots of star runners operate a ride much like this
one. It is a required competency to be able to run your own. Most of
us grumbled about the need to leave the acceleration webs and
actually inspect the ride, but we were taught that things could go
wrong with even are artificial intelligences. Suchee is following the
protocols set down by the Institute of Genetic Design. There is a hard
copy book and a digital one on this ride. Although it is all written
in (and here Captain Star Runner made a sound I had learned meant the
Members of the Race), I made a copy I knew all Terries could read.
Later I made sure all Space Traders Guilders could read the
documents.”</p>
<p>“Clever,” I said.</p>
<p>“Useful,” Captain Star Runner replied. “Keeping those copies was part
of my training. I never saw the wisdom of changing that process. It is
possible to live without an artificial intelligence. It is just very
time-consuming and uncomfortable. Because I often leave my ride when
we are parked somewhere, I have learned all of the social niceties of
bodily control.” Captain Star Runner made a sound I have always
translated as laughter. “I got excellent grades in that area. Most of
my classmates failed miserably.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think that was so?” I asked.</p>
<p>Captain Star Runner did not answer right away. “I do not have an
answer,” it finally said. “I just knew I needed to learn. Perhaps it
is a matter of pride, a striving.”</p>
<p>“A striving after what the gendered Pantherans do?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Perhaps. More what an independent Pantheran would do,” Star Runner
said.</p>
<p>“I have been thinking about that since I came to the Tigerfu,” I said.</p>
<p>“About me?” Captain Star Runner asked. “I would have thought you would
have been very angry at me for leaving you on Transfer Point
Seventeen.”</p>
<p>“I was angry,” I said. “I was very hurt, too, but I began, with help
from Dibenan, to understand much of my problems came from myself, not
from you or anyone else.”</p>
<p>We were in the lounge. I was eating my breakfast, propped up by some
large pillows. Star Runner was lying on the floor with a fuzzy blanket
over it. Star Runner found the floor temperatures cold while I found
the ride a little warm. I was only wearing undergarments and that
helped a bit.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about what Dibenan and I were discussing about me,
about being your own person. Then Janker and Suchee came. We talked
about whether you are a creature or a person. I immediately said you
were a person. It made a difference how they treated you and
what happened next.”</p>
<p>“And if I were a creature?” Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>“You would have been treated well, but you would not have agency,” I
said.</p>
<p>“They were remembering when the Followers of the Stars cultivated
Members of the Race for their own purposes,” Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” I said. “But more than that, I said you had determined for
yourself to go out on your own. They found that remarkable.”</p>
<p>“It was necessary,” Star Runner said. “I would have been terminated
otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” I said. “But you did not do that. Instead, you struck out
on your own.”</p>
<p>I leaned over and took Star Runner’s front paws in my hand and made
eye contact with those glittering green eyes. “I told them you were
special, that you were a fuchsia-colored Pantheran and this was your
mission and gift to your race. They had to treat you as a person.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think that?” Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>“I do,” I said. “You need to be the Pantheran you are to find a way
for your fellow ungendered Pantherans to be who they are. It may
simply be for you to show how to live independently. Someone else may
need to do other work.”</p>
<p>“I cannot free all the ungendered Pantherans by myself,” Star Runner
said, shrinking from the possibility.</p>
<p>“I do not think you have to. I think just convincing the Tigerfu will
be enough.”</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>“The Followers of the Stars almost destroyed them once,” I said, “but
they survived. I think they will eventually, probably not in our
lifetime, prevail. They will reach out to the western galactic arm, to
the races there that value freedom and individual choice. Tigerfu are
very socially-based. In a way they are like the Featherote and
pantherans, for that matter, but they also value individual
responsibility and choice like humans.”</p>
<p>“You will not like me saying this,” Star Runner said, “but I think
they should talk to Captain Gyllian Romeres-Lujo.”</p>
<p>“Gyllian would be a good contact for them,” I said. “I think Tamara
would be thrilled to add their history to her knowledge. They could
probably fill a lot of gaps in hers.”</p>
<p>“Tamara saved my life,” Captain Star Runner said. “I have been
thinking a lot about that. If you had not asked me about Tamara, I
would have been subsumed by the programs running aboard this ride.”</p>
<p>I felt blindsided. I thought Suchee, Janker and I had saved Star
Runner’s life. But I could see it from Star Runner’s point of view.
The bond between it and Tamara was so strong that even under great
duress it could not give Tamara up. It must be a wonderful gift to
have a friendship like that. I must not degrade it by jealousy.</p>
<p>Star Runner reached out a front paw and placed it over my hand. “We
have had our ups and downs,” Star Runner said. “I am not a very good
partner, but maybe your Tigerfu friends can help me learn.”</p>
<p>We held each other that way for a time, not speaking.</p>
<p>“I like that idea,” i said. “I know i am often unfaithful to you, but
you are still the love of my life.”</p>
<p>“I cannot give you what the others can,” Star Runner said. In my
mind’s eye, I saw the gestures of regret and sorrow, a sense of
inadequacy and frustration, too. I was thinking more and more in the
Tigerfu language of words and gestures.</p>
<p>“I cannot use that as an excuse anymore,” I said, dropping Star
Runner’s paw to make the Tigerfu gesture of finality.</p>
<p>“Suchee gave me a rimer on Tigerfu,” Star Runner said. “it is a
special one designed for those Tigerfu who must use their paw arms. We
should study it together so you learn the alternate gestures. Then we
can talk in Tigerfu now that we live here.”</p>
<p>“Can you speak Tigerfu?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I can make the sounds, if that what you mean?” That laughter sound
again. “You speak Tigerfu with a very thick accent. You cannot help
it. It is the way your mouth and tongue are shaped. I will speak it
well because the Tigerfu and i have similar mouth and tongue shapes.
Theirs are bigger, of course. They are bigger.”</p>
<p>“The difference between a tiger and a cat,” I said.</p>
<p>Star Runner’s tail twitched. “Yes,” it said without any additional
comment. The tail twitch was enough to mark its mild annoyance at the
comparison. It was, however, apt.</p>
<p>That evening we went to dinner with Suchee and Janker. They treated us
to a lovely meal aboard the research station.</p>
<p>“This reminds me of Over the Moon,” Captain Star Runner said. “It is
an old spaceport in the star system Detective Ronnie Camberwell comes
from. The League of Hypatian Pirates use it, but enterprising
entrepreneurs have turned much of it into entertainments for spacers.
People from Ptolemy City, where Detective Ronnie Camberwell lived,
also come across. The upper floor has glass so you can see the stars.
There is no dome. It is quite magical like this.</p>
<p>“We thought it would be a safe introduction to our culture,” Suchee
said. “Everyone on the research station knows about each of you. No
explanations or panics, just an acceptable level of curiosity.”</p>
<p>“It is wonderful to be here,” I said. “Thank you so much for your
invitation.”</p>
<p>“Our pleasure,” Suchee said. “Please do not think we are required to
do this. We want to get to know each of you better.”</p>
<p>“I hope you do not think this is a work-related question,” Janker
said, directing his comments to Captain Star Runner. “I was astonished
by your proficiency with the routing tables and the number of
insertion and extraction points you had created yourself. how do you
do that?”</p>
<p>“We were taught how to use those tables at school,,” Captain Star
Runner replied, delicately eating its appetizer of dumplings. “If all
our automated systems failed, we needed to know how to get back home.
That covers the tables themselves. The other,” it paused to eat
another dumpling. I knew Star Runner was trying to figure out what to
say. “We believe the Mother Of Us All has given each of us gifts.
Those of us bred to be star runners have the gift of sensing where
insertion and extraction points are. I would not be surprised if all
the jump gates you use were identified by Members of the Race,
particularly, star runners. I am particularly gifted. I can find them
and I can open existing gates that are either in disrepair or have
been locked. The Mother Of Us All has been very generous to me.”</p>
<p>“What a wonderful name,” Suchee said. “Can you tell me about her?”</p>
<p>“We see a constellation with many stars from our home world,” Captain
Star Runner said. “The constellation is known as the Mother OF Us All.
She is a Pantheran, like us. We can see her body and her cape. The
cape is interesting because no Member of the Race will ever wear one
because the Mother Of Us All wears the cape. She watches over us and
if we can see any star in her constellation, we will be safe.”</p>
<p>“And what if you cannot see any star?” Janker asked.</p>
<p>“Then we look in its direction.” Star Runner pointed out into the
star-filled sky. “If you look on every star chart from here to my home
world, you will find the star representing her right ear is on this
line. I always know where the Mother of Us All is.”</p>
<p>“Amazing,” Suchee said.</p>
<p>“She protected me by sending all of you to me when I was in distress,”
Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“Are all the members of your race religious?” Suchee asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Star Runner said. “It is quite old-fashioned to do and believe
as I do. I just know it is true. It is not the constellation that is
the Mother Of Us All. She is transcendent.” Star Runner turned to me.
“I learned that from attending the night of singing you humans
celebrate.”</p>
<p>“What is that?” Suchee asked me.</p>
<p>“Star Runner actually knows more about it than I do,” I said, “but
there is the holiday of the birth of a significant individual in our
history. Some believe he saved the world in a spiritual sense. Every
year people gather together to sing and praise and tell the story
again. Star Runner finds it very moving.”</p>
<p>“And do you?”</p>
<p>“I do not know,” I said. “After this experience, I will have to think
about it some more.”</p>
<p>The evening passed with more good food, good conversation and much
stargazing. Star Runner pointed out several Tigerfu constellations to
me.</p>
<p>“These are our second group of significant constellations,” Janker
said. “When we were driven out of  Tigerfu land we had to start all
over again. We adapted and created and we like our new stories.”</p>
<p>“Tigerfu Land?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You have been there,” Star Runner said. “It is Planet X.”</p>
<p>“So the Tigerfu made all those structures?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Star Runner said. “The Followers of the Stars did. When I looked
at all the murals, I found representations of a lot of races,
including the Tigerfu, the Members of the Race, the Featherote and the
Trollolu. I found others, but I do not know who they are.”</p>
<p>“We could probably identify them for you,” Suchee said. “We heard of
this, of course. It was about races they controlled, their own Hall of
Shame we call it.”</p>
<p>“It is almost in ruins,” I said. I did not want to spoil the evening
by confronting Star Runner about what it knew and had not shared. We
still had a lot of things to get straight between us. Instead, I
wrapped my arm around its neck and scratched. A comfortable purr
greeted my ministrations.</p>
<p>Later that night Star Runner made love to me. I was very hesitant. It
did not have its artificial intelligence to simulate a mutual
experience. Instead, Star Runner showed me all the ways to give it
physical pleasure, where to rub and stroke. It already knew all my
areas. The gentle sound of Star Runner’s purring made sleep come
easily.</p>
<p>Two days later, Janker and Suchee brought word from the Fungusians.</p>
<p>“I have no idea how they managed this turn around,” Janker said.
“However they did it, it is amazing.”</p>
<p>“What does it say?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We do not know,” Suchee said. “We thought Captain Star Runner should
get the message first.”</p>
<p>When Star Runner decoded the digital encryption it began to shake all
over.</p>
<p>“What is wrong?” Suchee and I asked quickly. Both she and Janker
gestured extreme agitation.</p>
<p>“They say the artificial intelligence cannot be repaired,” Captain
Star Runner finally said. “It has been fatally compromised.”</p>
<p>“Did we do something wrong?” Janker asked, again gesturing extreme
agitation.</p>
<p>“No,” Captain Star Runner said, reading more. “They say you did your
best but the patches applied were at the molecular level and cannot be
removed. They give instructions for complete erasure and how to
disinfect my memory banks.”</p>
<p>“That is a relief,” I said.</p>
<p>“They say I should be congratulated at being such a stickler for
backing up my data,” Captain Star Runner said. I heard a little of the
old confidence in its voice. “They have also sent very detailed
instructions for the software engineers to build a new artificial
intelligence. They say it will get the job done for me but without any
enhancements.”</p>
<p>“What sort of enhancements?” Janker asked.</p>
<p>“Personality for one thing,” Star Runner said. “I have worked with
this model before. It is basic and not very intuitive. I will have to
pay far more attention to the running of my ride, but that is
acceptable. I know how to do this. It may even be fun.”</p>
<p>“We will proceed as quickly as possible,” Janker said.</p>
<p>“We will have to set up some sort of payment,” Captain Star Runner
said.</p>
<p>“No,” Janker said. “You have provided us with those reports you were
couriering. That is sufficient payment for now.”</p>
<p>“Were you able to decode them?” Star Runner asked.</p>
<p>“We were. By having that information, we have already saved many
lives. We also know of significant plans of the People of the Rainbow
Sky. That is helpful.”</p>
<p>I waited for Captain Star Runner to be ready to talk with me. It was
so focused on its ride and the reconstruction of its artificial
intelligence. Even so, it took time to be with me, not talking deeply,
but physical presence. I found the sheer simplicity of our time
together so comforting.</p>
<p>I spent the time in meditation and reflection when I was not helping
with ride maintenance. The techniques Dibenan had taught me were
useful. I also made time, in the wee hours of my morning, to talk with
her.</p>
<p>“You are doing good work there,” Dibenan told me. “Keep it up. Your
relationship with Captain Star Runner is finding its own way. Have you
noticed how vulnerable you are to each other. There is no pretense any
more. The barrier each of you felt with the presence of the artificial
intelligence is gone. How do you feel about that?”</p>
<p>“Free,” I said before I could think of an answer. “I do not feel as if
I am being watched or judged. Star Runner is very open. I could say it
is simple, but it is not.”</p>
<p>“Not simple as in emotionally or mentally inferior?” Dibenan asked.</p>
<p>“Simple meaning not hiding anything or over complicating,” I said. “I
think I am going to like the new artificial intelligence. I think Star
Runner is looking forward to something less intrusive, too.”</p>
<p>“Simple is often better,” Dibenan said. “Not always, of course, but in
this case, it might be the right anecdote for both of you.” She
paused. I waited. Her gesture suggested a change of direction, a new
thought. “Have you considered what you are going to do next? Will you
stay with Star Runner or do something else?”</p>
<p>“I have been meditating and reflecting on that as my practice,” I
said. “The research station is quite pleasant. I have visited there
almost daily. I am comfortable with these Tigerfu as well. I think I
would like to come back to the Habitat and start my training. Star
Runner and I have not worked anything out yet.”</p>
<p>“You have a lot of issues to work out,” Dibenan said.</p>
<p>“We do,” I agreed. “However, we are living in the moment right now.
Much is unsettled.”</p>
<p>“For a long-term relationship to work–” Dibenan began.</p>
<p>I interrupted her, “Yes, we have a lot to discuss. This is quite
difficult because Captain Star Runner is not hooked up to its memory
banks. It is recording these memories but does not have its full
capabilities on line. Besides,” I added, “its focus will be integrating
with the new artificial intelligence and getting its life in order.
Conversation is ongoing with military intelligence.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Dibenan said, “there is a place for you in intelligence.”</p>
<p>I stopped what I was going to say. “I had not thought of that,” I
said.</p>
<p>“Criminal investigation as well,” Dibenan continued. “I will make some
inquiries.”</p>
<p>I had not considered any of this. The military hardly seemed the place
for me, but there was a war on. People who did not see themselves as
having a military bent often served in wartime.</p>
<p>I realized–Dibenan would have been pleased–that I was not trusting
again, scurrying back to the Habitat and its protective world, pushing
Star, Suchee and Janker away from me, ready to take up professional
relationships with Gemall and Dibenan and pretend they were friends.</p>
<p>“Detective Ronnie Camberwell,” Star Runner called. “Suchee and Janker
are here. We are ready to turn on the artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>I went to the control center. Workers and bots had been coming in and
out of the ride for several days. The control center had been under
construction. I had assumed this work was directly tied to the
installation of the artificial intelligence. I found the pedestal the
People of the Rainbow Sky had installed had been removed. Star
Runner’s familiar acceleration web replaced the pedestal. Several
chairs suitable for Tigerfu and a human chair had been installed along
with all the requisite screens and controls. I sat down in my chair.</p>
<p>“Very nice,” I said to Star Runner. “Very thoughtful of you.”</p>
<p>My screen was lit. I saw information about the start process. Star
Runner did not climb into its acceleration web, but stood back,
hopping from paw to paw with anticipation. I surmised it was getting a
visual feed.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>Consider what sort of display futuristic humans would
use–a visual display like Captain Star Runner’s
within the brain, on a personal device or on an
external screen.</p>
</div>
<p>“Everything is looking good,” one of the engineers said.</p>
<p>“Everything checks out,” Janker said.</p>
<p>“Captain Star Runner, is everything all right?” Suchee asked.</p>
<p>“I am checking my status reports,” Star Runner said. It stepped toward
my screen. “Detective Ronnie Camberwell, please bring up ride status.”</p>
<p>That was easy enough. I had a control labeled status.</p>
<p>“My internal feed from the artificial intelligence matches the status
report on the screen,” Captain Star Runner said.</p>
<p>“The artificial intelligence is working with ship systems,” Janker
said. Turning to the engineer, he said, “Now for personal
integration.”</p>
<p>This was the test. Both the engineer and Janker tensed, ready to
disable the artificial intelligence if something went wrong. Suchee
moved to stand by Captain Star Runner. My stomach churned.</p>
<p>“Integration complete,” Janker said. “Captain Star Runner–”</p>
<p>Star Runner said nothing for five whole seconds, but did not indicate
any distress.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Star Runner said. “We were establishing a connection.”</p>
<p>“Is everything all right?” Suchee asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, as far as I can tell,” Star Runner said. “This is a familiar AI
to me. We have worked together before although this particular
instance has not accessed those records completely. It will have to run
for some time creating all its indexes and cross references. I am
connected but we are not fully synchronized. I am going to be busy
directing and helping. I will not be able to speak.” Star Runner moved
to the acceleration web. “Time to do the medical tests, Suchee. Please
oversee.”</p>
<p>I monitored the vessel’s displays both in the control center and in
the cargo hold. Suchee monitored Star Runner and Janker and the
engineer monitored everything else. When everything was finished, we
were all exhausted but very happy.</p>
<p>Later we had a party aboard the research station. Many came to
celebrate. Many needed to be thanked.</p>
<p>I saw Star Runner in a huddle with several of the Intelligence
personnel including Janker.</p>
<p>“They are discussing assignments,” Suchee said, taking my arm. “You
might want to chat with these people.”</p>
<p>Surprised, I let her guide me over to one of the floor to ceiling
windows looking outward to space.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-to-self admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">NOTE TO SELF</p>
<p>I am not up to names right now. These people may get
names later.</p>
</div>
<p>After introductions, the colonel said to me, “We understand your
background is police work and investigations.”</p>
<p>“That is correct,” I said.</p>
<p>“We have read the reports Gemall and Dibenan have sent us and the
recommendations Janker and Suchee have given. We were wondering if you
would be interested in working for us.”</p>
<p>“And who would us be?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We are a special task force,” the colonel said. “We are investigating
war crimes perpetrated by the People of the Rainbow Sky and the
Followers of the Stars. It is tough work, but I think you will find it
rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “I think I will.”</p>
<p>When we returned to Captain Star Runner’s ride, Star Runner said to
me, “I have a mission. Unfortunately, I cannot discuss it with you.
Unfortunately, it means you cannot go with me.”</p>
<p>“How do you feel about that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sad,” Star Runner said. “We have lots to talk about. There has not
been time.”</p>
<p>“I am sad, too,” I said, “because we do have lots of things to talk
about, but I am excited for you and I have news, too. I have a job
with the special task force on war crimes.”</p>
<p>“That is excellent,” Star Runner said. “We have a future here in
Tigerfu land.”</p>

<p>This has been a very messy story to write. It is not well-plotted or
well-balanced, but the general outline of it pleases me. Many holes
remain. Here are a few I know off the top of my head.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It is not clear who is fighting who and why. The players in the war
need to be sorted out more clearly and the players identified and
what they hope to achieve.</p></li>
<li><p>The People of the Golden Sun need to be clarified. Are they a
propaganda tool of the People of the Rainbow Sky or are they a real
group, perhaps pirates, that the People of the Rainbow Sky have
exploited.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the Followers of the Stars up to.</p></li>
<li><p>What were the agents on Transfer Point Seventeen doing and was Suri
Iglesia involved?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the archaeological work on Planet X fit in?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the state of technology in general? How advanced is
everyone anyway?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>The End</p>
