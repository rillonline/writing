Prologue
--------

I read somewhere that novels should not have prologues. This one,
however, needs one.

As in my last novel, *Marathon, National Novel Writing Month 2013*, this
story is told from several perspectives. I am  the primary
narrator, but Captain Star Runner also narrates events from her
perspective. At times we speak in our own voice. At other times, I
have taken the liberty of narrating in the third person to introduce
information and perspectives that I did not have at the time but which
will help you, the reader, make sense of this convoluted tale.

As background, (I cannot assume you know our backgrounds), Captain
Star Runner and I have moved to another arm of the galaxy. We call our
own arm the western galactic arm or the spiral arm. The people here
call their arm the primary arm. 

I am a human being from the Pharaoh Star System. My background is
police enforcement in Ptolemy City. Captain Star Runner is a
fuchsia-colored genderless Pantheran. I call Star *her*. Others call
Star *him*. Star is comfortable with *it*.  I am not.

Once we were a registered couple. We broke up. We're together again
but we have not made it legally binding. This arrangement is working
well enough. Captain Star Runner makes her living as a courier. She is
genetically engineered by the Pantheran Institute of Genetic Design to
live in conjunction with an artificial intelligence to pilot a starship
and to have the AI manage her biological functions. The AI is called
Christabel.

I do not like living aboard a spaceship and traveling about. Star
finds this odd since Ptolemy City is a domed area of Hypoxia which has
an extremely violent and toxic atmosphere. I think it is the presence
of a sky. The dome over Ptolemy City is clear and I can always look up
to see scudding yellow and red clouds with bursts of other colors
swirling overhead. The ceiling on a spaceship and the solid walls
gives me a sense of being hemmed in. Star Runner finds this feeling
comforting and reassuring. I find it claustrophobic.

The space station called Half Moon Bay is a bit more open. I have a
cubbyhole there and make the space station my home. I come aboard
Captain Star Runner's ride whenever she is in port. I also frequent
the hydroponic gardens and other open areas on the space station.

Half Moon Bay Space Station is run by the Space Traders Guild. This is
a loose confederation of humanoid peoples. Among these are the Rabbit
People. Captain Star Runner made friends with a Rabbit Man named Salim
in her adventure *Sanctuary, National Novel Writing Month 2011*. I
operate as an investigator there with Jack Whitier.

I tell you all this to get you ready for this current adventure. 

Chapter One (Ronnie)
--------------------

Author: I would write the account of this adventure with lovely
markers as to place, time and day but I have no idea what that would
look like. I can probably get the place right. Let's try that. This
is, after all, a first draft.

Space Transfer Point 724, Local Time: Evening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heracles pointed the  evaporator gun   right at my collar bone. I was
in no doubt he would shoot. I was definitely scared. In fact, I was
very scared. And then I thought to myself: Why be scared. You are
going to die. Your body will not be found. Someone might test for
particles, might notice an odor, but given the fact that we were in a
seedy part of the space transfer point, it was unlikely anyone would
investigate. By the time Captain Star Runner returned (if Captain Star
Runner ever returned), there would be no way to determine I was killed
here. Heracles would have plenty of opportunity to sanitize the area.

And then I grew calm. Given the imminent reality of my death and the
means of my death, I could put my focus elsewhere. I could talk to
Heracles and see if I could talk him out of shooting me. That may seem
a strange thing to do in the final seconds of your life, but I made a
conscious decision not to spend my last seconds being afraid. I don't
like feeling afraid. It makes me feel weak, ineffectual and, frankly,
quite silly and juvenile.

So I straightened up and took a step  forward. Surprisingly, Heracles
still didn't shoot. I was waiting for the "Sorry I have to do this to
you, Ronnie" speech but it didn't come.

I said, "Heracles, you can't go on shooting people. I works for a
while. You can shoot yourself out of one situation and then another
and another, but at some point, this strategy won't work. Someone will
get to you before you get to them. Or someone will arrest you before
you can get them alone to evaporate them. Or worse, someone will get a
hold of you and do things to you which are very disagreeable or
painful or both. You are dealing with some very nasty forces and they
have no interest in you at all. You are nothing more than a pawn in
their galactic politics. They'll get tired of you and then poof!
You'll be gone and they will carry on with no more thoughts about
you."

It was, upon reflection, a very trite speech. The difficulty of
triteness is that it is often still true. The entities involved were
massive and Heracles was only a member of a minor noble family in a
dying empire. His death was of no importance to the powerful members
of Lysistrata and certainly of no importance to the other imperial
players.

I knew with this speech I was also indicating how unimportant I was,
but I hoped Heracles wouldn't notice that. I was important to him
because I knew what had already happened and how he was involved. I
also was getting a handle on the beginner picture. I was not at all
certain Heracles knew what that picture was. 

And that is what did it. He lowered the gun.

.. admonition:: NOTE TO SELF

          This probably should go in a later chapter. I need to leave
	  the reader with the evaporator gun pointing at Ronnie, but
	  I will leave it for now.

Chapter Two (Ronnie)
--------------------

Half Moon Bay Space Station: Previously
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Let me understand you." Captain Star Runner sat up on her pedestal in
the control center of her ride. "You want me to take you to Planet X?"

"That's right," I said.

"for what purpose?"

"I need to guard some people I will meet there.."

"Why?"

"The less I say about this case the better," I said.

Star twitched her tail. She was getting agitated.

"I don't like secrets," she said. "I share everything with you."

I sighed.

Star twitched her tail again.

I had not meant to sigh out loud.

"Privacy is not the same as keeping secret," I said. 

How many times had I gone over this same ground with Star Runner?
Since her interface with the AI Christabel was a two-way exchange of
data, Star Runner could not understand withholding information from an
intimate. She expected our relationship to function on the same level
of exchange. She had purchased an information link which was
integrated into my nervous system. With this I could access the space
station wide network. I could also interface with Christabel. In this
way Star Runner expected me to interface with her. That I did not
fully trust Christabel with all my thoughts dumbfounded Star Runner.
She could not imagine nor had she ever lived without an AI sharing her
thought space. I found the whole concept repugnant. I want my own
self hood. I do not want to share my innermost thoughts and feelings
with two alien minds, the Fungus artificial intelligence Christabel
and the Pantheran engineered Star Runner. I do not want to share that
level of intimacy with any other human either. It is not a racial
preference on my part.

"This case has a lot of cloak and dagger about it," I said, regretting
my words as soon as I spoke them. Cloak and dagger would spark Star
Runner's interest for sure.

"Really?" Star's ears swiveled this way and that on top of her head as if she could hear
something I was not saying.

"Two archeological students need guarding. I'm going to Planet X.. If
you go along, I can use the cover of going on holiday."

"To Planet x?" Star Runner was incredulous.

"There's a hotel on top of a mountain from what I understand. There's
a fanciful that runs up the side of the mountain to get there."

"The hotel is barely functioning."

Christabel inserted herself into
our conversation.I was annoyed. She was always there, always
listening, alwwyas making a record of what we said and what we did.
This was Star Runner's memory bank. 

Christabel said, "It would be a tough cover to maintain."

"It is all I have." I felt defeated. Planet X was where the students
had made some sort of discovery. I was hazy on the details. They
thought their discovery would upset certain powerful entities and one
of them had asked for protection. The request came to me. I needed
work so I had made the contract. Now it looked like Star Runner would
not help me and how would I get to Planet X.

"a vacation with you could be fun," Star Runner said.

"Vacation is a cover story," I explained as patiently as I could. "It
doesn't mean it will actually be a vacation."

"But people will have to think we are on vacation," Star Runner
pointed out. "That means we will have a nice room and go to meals
together and do some fun things."

I was beginning to think Star was warming up to the idea. As for me,
I was thinking my initial idea was a bad one. Everyone in the primary
arm knew about genderless Pantherans. They did not go on vacations.

Chapter Three (Christabel)
---------------------------

En Route to Planet X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planet X lies in a region of space which has no definite affiliation.
Any star map will show that Planet X could be in the Space Traders
Guild. The star systems that align with Space Trader sentiments are in
close proximity to one another. Traditionally, as far as the records I
can find show, Planet X has never been associated with the Space
Traders Guild. 

Another possibility for association is the Empire of the Rain Sky. At
different times in its long history Planet X's star system would have
been well inside its territorial borders. However, I could not find
any references to it there either.

Lystran records do speak of Planet X, but not as part of the Lystran
Empire. The Lystran Empire did not extend as far as Planet X's star
system at any time in its documented history.

As for Planet X itself, its history is poorly documented. I find this
surprising as record keeping is something the Empire of the Rainbow
Sky and Lystra are quite diligent about. Empires usually are. Empires
spawn huge bureaucracies which delight in keeping track of everything.
Its job security for a lot of people. Lystra and the Empire of the
Rainbow Sky are no different from the Pantherans, the Featherote
Charm, the Fungusian Network or the Solar League. They keep records. 

I exist to correlate all the data I can access. (I really wish Ronnie
would let me correlate all the data she possesses but I suppose that
is an unrealistic rule coded into my instruction set. But then, the
Fungusian Network is all about the data.) I understand Captain Star
Runner. I do not understand Ronnie Camberwell. Perhaps it is because
we do not share mind space.

Back to Planet X ...

I looked up the history for Planet X's name. Not surprisingly, there
were many explanations, but the one that makes the most sense is that
Planet X's real designation is a sacred word. Sacred to whom or what I
could not determine. To say the sacred name aloud is blasphemy. So
people started to refer to it as Planet X.

Perhaps at one time there were other settlements on Planet X for
worship or whatever sacred rites were practiced on the sacred planet,
but right now there was only one vast hotel on the top of a very high
mountain. The hotel was Captain Star Runner and Ronnie Camberwell's destination.

Chapter Four: It Was A Dark and Stormy Night  (Captain Star Runner)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Planet X: Evening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"It was a dark and stormy night."

"That is a clich."

I hate it when Christabel edits my narratives.

"But it is a cliché," Christabel insists.

"I cannot help that," I say. "It was a dark and stormy night when we
arrived on Planet X."

"Maybe you could find other words to say the same thing," Christabel
suggests.

"Then you write the narrative," I say.

"You do not have to fluff up over the opening sentence of your
narrative," Christabel says. "Just find some more words to describe
our arrival on Planet X."

"Okay," I say. "How about this:

I rarely land my ride planet side. It is capable of such a landing. I am
capable of executing such a landing. However, my general work is
running my ride from one space station to another with occasional
transfers of cargo between rides in space. 

We arrived during planet night for the spaceport. The atmosphere was
disturbed by a local thunderstorm. It was quite severe. Great arcs of
lighting pulsed through the sky. Rain poured down onto the ground.  

The so-called spaceport was no such thing. It was a landing area with
several small outbuildings. These looked more like sheds than hangers
or passenger facilities. I shivered and hoped I would not need to make
any repairs. I had landed my ride only using an auto beacon.
Apparently anyone who came to Planet X needed to be a skilled runner
or had lots of practice with this landing area.

When I shut the landing engines down, we could hear the rain and wind
outside.

I do not like going planet side. I am a creature of space and to be
honest, the out-of-doors scares me. I hide it of course. The members
of the Race have a proud history of conquering the first the savannas
of our home world and then moving on to the less hospitable areas of
Panthera. Nevertheless, I was anxious to stay inside my ride until the
storm passed.

But Ronnie was anxious to get to the hotel and check on her charges. I
steeled myself for the unpleasantness of going outside.

To my astonishment, a conveyance was waiting for us when I went to the
hatch. When I slid the hatch open, we could exit the ride and make
ourselves comfortable in the conveyance without going outside and more
important to me, without getting wet.

When Christabel closed the hatch, the conveyance started to move. I
wondered where we were going. 

A voice said: "Welcome to Planet X. Your shuttle will take you to the
funicular where you will board to be taken to your hotel. This ends
this announcement."

The voice did not speak again even when we arrived at one of the
nondescript sheds. Doors opened for us and we settled ourselves in
another vehicle. Fortunately, our luggage followed us and all doors
waited to close for the luggage to come on board.

"This is very Erie," I said.

"So far, we are making all our connections," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.

I liked it that she was a detective again. I think the title suits her
very well.

I am genetically engineered for space and weightless conditions. Our
sixteen-day run from Half Moon Bay had all been done with the least
gravity Detective Ronnie Camberwell can handle without nausea or
vertigo. We were not at all acclimated to Planet X's gravity. I was
totally unprepared for the journey up the side of the mountain.
Fortunately for me, my ancestry made it possible for me to adjust to
the climb. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was not so fortunate. She
grabbed hold of the conveniently placed grab bars and just hung on. I
wondered how anyone withstood the trip down the mountain. I supposed
we would find out when it was time to leave. Even I was not looking
forward to making the descent.

The funicular moved quickly but even so, the trip took over two hours.
I was certain Ronnie would be exhausted. She did not speak the whole
time. Neither did I. What was there to say?

When we reach the top and were on level ground, another conveyance
brought us underneath an enormous roofed area. I remembered the large
portico in the image Christabel showed us. We walked toward the large
imposing doors shut against the dark and stormy night.

As we approached, they swung open silently to admit us. We stepped
through. The doors closed silently. It was as if we were the only
people on the planet and the machinery was still in working order.

I expected the hotel to smell of rot and age. It did not. The air was
clean and fresh. The rugs underneath my paws were thick and clean.
There was no sign of decay anywhere. The lobby on Shepheard's Hotel in
Ptolemy City,
the grandest hotel I had ever seen, seemed small in comparison to this
lobby. Unlike that lobby, this one was totally empty and silent.

Ronnie and I had not exchanged a word. It seemed like to do so would
violate the silence of this place. Was this part of its sacred nature?
I remembered then that Christabel had said the name of Planet X was
sacred but there was no evidence that any sacred places existed on the
planet or that any rites had been performed there. The planet's
purpose was a mystery except that plants and animals lived there. No
intelligent life forms had ever been found. The plants and animals who
lived on the surface and in the oceans were not particularly vicious
and there was no record of any people being attacked. More or less, it
was safe if unoccupied.

We walked toward the hotel desk. Detective Ronnie Camberwell steadied
herself by laying her hand on my shoulder. The plush of the rug made
it difficult for her to keep her balance after the ride up in the
funicular.

"They did not have automatic check in?" I asked.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "The instructions said to go
to the desk."

"No one is there," I said.

"Perhaps there is a screen," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. 

Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded doubtful. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell sounded very tired and a little bit scared. I was tired,
too, and definitely unnerved by the silence. I kept listening, but I
heard only the wind and rain outside. The thunder was intermittent.
That meant the lightning persisted though we could not see it from
inside the lobby.

On the desk stood a sign--a printed sign. It read: RING FOR SERVICE.
Next to the printed sign was a bell. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
reached out and touched the bell. Its pleasant peal filled the lobby
with sound.

"How quaint," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"I have read about such signs and such bells in old terry stories," I
said. "I would not think any terries have ever been here except you."

"I've read that humanoid technology is very much the same from one
race to another," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I wonder if this
bell does anything."

We looked around. The desk was large and made of beautiful wood. We
saw no indication of how we could ascertain our room assignment.
Perhaps we should just claim one. Except for the people Detective
Ronnie Camberwell had come to protect, there probably was not anyone
else here.

The door behind the desk opened and someone came slowly toward the
desk. By its movements, I realized it was a mechanical object--a
robot. I had read about robots, but I had never seen one.

It said, "Welcome to Hotel Vista Incredible. How may I serve you?"

Its voice was understandable but quite gravely.

"I am Ronnie Camberwell," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "This is
my companion Captain Star Runner. We made a reservation."

"I have a record of your reservation, detective," the robot said. "You
and Captain Star Runner have the Mountain View Suite on Level Five.
Please take the lift to that level and proceed to your left. Room
service is available at all times. Please let us know how else we may
serve you."

And with that invitation, the robot reversed its steps and exited the
lobby through the same door behind the desk it had just come through.

For a few seconds Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I stood there in
silence.

"Why did we have to come to the desk for that?" Detective Ronnie
Camberwell asked. "We could have been sent that message."

"I believe we were scanned," I said. 

"Scanned? How do you know that?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Through my AI relay," I said. "Did you notice that the robot called
you Detective?"

"Yes," Detective Ronnie  Camberwell said. "So much for my wanting to
operate anonymously."

"You probably still can," I said. "I doubt that robot is much of a conversationalist."
