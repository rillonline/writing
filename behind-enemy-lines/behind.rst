The Adventures of Star Runner, the Pantheran Book Unknown

Prologue
--------

I read somewhere that novels should not have prologues. This one,
however, needs one.

As in my last novel, *Marathon, National Novel Writing Month 2013*, this
story is told from several perspectives. I am  the primary
narrator, but Captain Star Runner also narrates events from her
perspective. At times we speak in our own voice. At other times, I
have taken the liberty of narrating in the third person to introduce
information and perspectives that I did not have at the time but which
will help you, the reader, make sense of this convoluted tale.

As background, (I cannot assume you know our backgrounds), Captain
Star Runner and I have moved to another arm of the galaxy. We call our
own arm the western galactic arm or the spiral arm. The people here
call their arm the primary arm. 

I am a human being from the Pharaoh Star System. My background is
police enforcement in Ptolemy City. Captain Star Runner is a
fuchsia-colored genderless Pantheran. I call Star *her*. Others call
Star *him*. Star is comfortable with *it*.  I am not.

Once we were a registered couple. We broke up. We're together again
but we have not made it legally binding. This arrangement is working
well enough. Captain Star Runner makes her living as a courier. She is
genetically engineered by the Pantheran Institute of Genetic Design to
live in conjunction with an artificial intelligence to pilot a starship
and to have the AI manage her biological functions. The AI is called
Christabel.

I do not like living aboard a spaceship and traveling about. Star
finds this odd since Ptolemy City is a domed area of Hypoxia which has
an extremely violent and toxic atmosphere. I think it is the presence
of a sky. The dome over Ptolemy City is clear and I can always look up
to see scudding yellow and red clouds with bursts of other colors
swirling overhead. The ceiling on a spaceship and the solid walls
gives me a sense of being hemmed in. Star Runner finds this feeling
comforting and reassuring. I find it claustrophobic.

The space station called Half Moon Bay is a bit more open. I have a
cubbyhole there and make the space station my home. I come aboard
Captain Star Runner's ride whenever she is in port. I also frequent
the hydroponic gardens and other open areas on the space station.

Half Moon Bay Space Station is run by the Space Traders Guild. This is
a loose confederation of humanoid peoples. Among these are the Rabbit
People. Captain Star Runner made friends with a Rabbit Man named Salim
in her adventure *Sanctuary, National Novel Writing Month 2011*. I
operate as an investigator there with Jack Whitier.

I tell you all this to get you ready for this current adventure. 

Chapter One (Ronnie)
--------------------

Author: I would write the account of this adventure with lovely
markers as to place, time and day but I have no idea what that would
look like. I can probably get the place right. Let's try that. This
is, after all, a first draft.

Space Transfer Point 724, Local Time: Evening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heracles pointed the  evaporator gun   right at my collar bone. I was
in no doubt he would shoot. I was definitely scared. In fact, I was
very scared. And then I thought to myself: Why be scared. You are
going to die. Your body will not be found. Someone might test for
particles, might notice an odor, but given the fact that we were in a
seedy part of the space transfer point, it was unlikely anyone would
investigate. By the time Captain Star Runner returned (if Captain Star
Runner ever returned), there would be no way to determine I was killed
here. Heracles would have plenty of opportunity to sanitize the area.

And then I grew calm. Given the imminent reality of my death and the
means of my death, I could put my focus elsewhere. I could talk to
Heracles and see if I could talk him out of shooting me. That may seem
a strange thing to do in the final seconds of your life, but I made a
conscious decision not to spend my last seconds being afraid. I don't
like feeling afraid. It makes me feel weak, ineffectual and, frankly,
quite silly and juvenile.

So I straightened up and took a step  forward. Surprisingly, Heracles
still didn't shoot. I was waiting for the "Sorry I have to do this to
you, Ronnie" speech but it didn't come.

I said, "Heracles, you can't go on shooting people. I works for a
while. You can shoot yourself out of one situation and then another
and another, but at some point, this strategy won't work. Someone will
get to you before you get to them. Or someone will arrest you before
you can get them alone to evaporate them. Or worse, someone will get a
hold of you and do things to you which are very disagreeable or
painful or both. You are dealing with some very nasty forces and they
have no interest in you at all. You are nothing more than a pawn in
their galactic politics. They'll get tired of you and then poof!
You'll be gone and they will carry on with no more thoughts about
you."

It was, upon reflection, a very trite speech. The difficulty of
triteness is that it is often still true. The entities involved were
massive and Heracles was only a member of a minor noble family in a
dying empire. His death was of no importance to the powerful members
of Lysistrata and certainly of no importance to the other imperial
players.

I knew with this speech I was also indicating how unimportant I was,
but I hoped Heracles wouldn't notice that. I was important to him
because I knew what had already happened and how he was involved. I
also was getting a handle on the beginner picture. I was not at all
certain Heracles knew what that picture was. 

And that is what did it. He lowered the gun.

.. admonition:: NOTE TO SELF

          This probably should go in a later chapter. I need to leave
	  the reader with the evaporator gun pointing at Ronnie, but
	  I will leave it for now.

Chapter Two (Ronnie)
--------------------

Half Moon Bay Space Station: Previously
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Let me understand you." Captain Star Runner sat up on her pedestal in
the control center of her ride. "You want me to take you to Planet X?"

"That's right," I said.

"for what purpose?"

"I need to guard some people I will meet there.."

"Why?"

"The less I say about this case the better," I said.

Star twitched her tail. She was getting agitated.

"I don't like secrets," she said. "I share everything with you."

I sighed.

Star twitched her tail again.

I had not meant to sigh out loud.

"Privacy is not the same as keeping secret," I said. 

How many times had I gone over this same ground with Star Runner?
Since her interface with the AI Christabel was a two-way exchange of
data, Star Runner could not understand withholding information from an
intimate. She expected our relationship to function on the same level
of exchange. She had purchased an information link which was
integrated into my nervous system. With this I could access the space
station wide network. I could also interface with Christabel. In this
way Star Runner expected me to interface with her. That I did not
fully trust Christabel with all my thoughts dumbfounded Star Runner.
She could not imagine nor had she ever lived without an AI sharing her
thought space. I found the whole concept repugnant. I want my own
self hood. I do not want to share my innermost thoughts and feelings
with two alien minds, the Fungus artificial intelligence Christabel
and the Pantheran engineered Star Runner. I do not want to share that
level of intimacy with any other human either. It is not a racial
preference on my part.

"This case has a lot of cloak and dagger about it," I said, regretting
my words as soon as I spoke them. Cloak and dagger would spark Star
Runner's interest for sure.

"Really?" Star's ears swiveled this way and that on top of her head as if she could hear
something I was not saying.

"Two archaeological students need guarding. I'm going to Planet X.. If
you go along, I can use the cover of going on holiday."

"To Planet x?" Star Runner was incredulous.

"There's a hotel on top of a mountain from what I understand. There's
a fanciful that runs up the side of the mountain to get there."

"The hotel is barely functioning."

Christabel inserted herself into
our conversation.I was annoyed. She was always there, always
listening, always making a record of what we said and what we did.
This was Star Runner's memory bank. 

Christabel said, "It would be a tough cover to maintain."

"It is all I have." I felt defeated. Planet X was where the students
had made some sort of discovery. I was hazy on the details. They
thought their discovery would upset certain powerful entities and one
of them had asked for protection. The request came to me. I needed
work so I had made the contract. Now it looked like Star Runner would
not help me and how would I get to Planet X.

"a vacation with you could be fun," Star Runner said.

"Vacation is a cover story," I explained as patiently as I could. "It
doesn't mean it will actually be a vacation."

"But people will have to think we are on vacation," Star Runner
pointed out. "That means we will have a nice room and go to meals
together and do some fun things."

I was beginning to think Star was warming up to the idea. As for me,
I was thinking my initial idea was a bad one. Everyone in the primary
arm knew about genderless Pantherans. They did not go on vacations.

Chapter Three (Christabel)
---------------------------

En Route to Planet X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planet X lies in a region of space which has no definite affiliation.
Any star map will show that Planet X could be in the Space Traders
Guild. The star systems that align with Space Trader sentiments are in
close proximity to one another. Traditionally, as far as the records I
can find show, Planet X has never been associated with the Space
Traders Guild. 

Another possibility for association is the Empire of the Rain Sky. At
different times in its long history Planet X's star system would have
been well inside its territorial borders. However, I could not find
any references to it there either.

Lystran records do speak of Planet X, but not as part of the Lystran
Empire. The Lystran Empire did not extend as far as Planet X's star
system at any time in its documented history.

As for Planet X itself, its history is poorly documented. I find this
surprising as record keeping is something the Empire of the Rainbow
Sky and Lystran are quite diligent about. Empires usually are. Empires
spawn huge bureaucracies which delight in keeping track of everything.
Its job security for a lot of people. Lystra and the Empire of the
Rainbow Sky are no different from the Pantherans, the Featherote
Charm, the Fungusian Network or the Solar League. They keep records. 

I exist to correlate all the data I can access. (I really wish Ronnie
would let me correlate all the data she possesses but I suppose that
is an unrealistic rule coded into my instruction set. But then, the
Fungusian Network is all about the data.) I understand Captain Star
Runner. I do not understand Ronnie Camberwell. Perhaps it is because
we do not share mind space.

Back to Planet X ...

I looked up the history for Planet X's name. Not surprisingly, there
were many explanations, but the one that makes the most sense is that
Planet X's real designation is a sacred word. Sacred to whom or what I
could not determine. To say the sacred name aloud is blasphemy. So
people started to refer to it as Planet X.

Perhaps at one time there were other settlements on Planet X for
worship or whatever sacred rites were practiced on the sacred planet,
but right now there was only one vast hotel on the top of a very high
mountain. The hotel was Captain Star Runner and Ronnie Camberwell's destination.

Chapter Four: It Was A Dark and Stormy Night  (Captain Star Runner)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Planet X: Evening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"It was a dark and stormy night."

"That is a cliché."

I hate it when Christabel edits my narratives.

"But it is a cliché," Christabel insists.

"I cannot help that," I say. "It was a dark and stormy night when we
arrived on Planet X."

"Maybe you could find other words to say the same thing," Christabel
suggests.

"Then you write the narrative," I say.

"You do not have to fluff up over the opening sentence of your
narrative," Christabel says. "Just find some more words to describe
our arrival on Planet X."

"Okay," I say. "How about this:

I rarely land my ride planet side. It is capable of such a landing. I am
capable of executing such a landing. However, my general work is
running my ride from one space station to another with occasional
transfers of cargo between rides in space. 

We arrived during planet night for the spaceport. The atmosphere was
disturbed by a local thunderstorm. It was quite severe. Great arcs of
lighting pulsed through the sky. Rain poured down onto the ground.  

The so-called spaceport was no such thing. It was a landing area with
several small outbuildings. These looked more like sheds than hangers
or passenger facilities. I shivered and hoped I would not need to make
any repairs. I had landed my ride only using an auto beacon.
Apparently anyone who came to Planet X needed to be a skilled runner
or had lots of practice with this landing area.

When I shut the landing engines down, we could hear the rain and wind
outside.

I do not like going planet side. I am a creature of space and to be
honest, the out-of-doors scares me. I hide it of course. The members
of the Race have a proud history of conquering the first the savannas
of our home world and then moving on to the less hospitable areas of
Panthera. Nevertheless, I was anxious to stay inside my ride until the
storm passed.

But Ronnie was anxious to get to the hotel and check on her charges. I
steeled myself for the unpleasantness of going outside.

To my astonishment, a conveyance was waiting for us when I went to the
hatch. When I slid the hatch open, we could exit the ride and make
ourselves comfortable in the conveyance without going outside and more
important to me, without getting wet.

When Christabel closed the hatch, the conveyance started to move. I
wondered where we were going. 

A voice said: "Welcome to Planet X. Your shuttle will take you to the
funicular where you will board to be taken to your hotel. This ends
this announcement."

The voice did not speak again even when we arrived at one of the
nondescript sheds. Doors opened for us and we settled ourselves in
another vehicle. Fortunately, our luggage followed us and all doors
waited to close for the luggage to come on board.

"This is very Erie," I said.

"So far, we are making all our connections," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.

I liked it that she was a detective again. I think the title suits her
very well.

I am genetically engineered for space and weightless conditions. Our
sixteen-day run from Half Moon Bay had all been done with the least
gravity Detective Ronnie Camberwell can handle without nausea or
vertigo. We were not at all acclimated to Planet X's gravity. I was
totally unprepared for the journey up the side of the mountain.
Fortunately for me, my ancestry made it possible for me to adjust to
the climb. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was not so fortunate. She
grabbed hold of the conveniently placed grab bars and just hung on. I
wondered how anyone withstood the trip down the mountain. I supposed
we would find out when it was time to leave. Even I was not looking
forward to making the descent.

The funicular moved quickly but even so, the trip took over two hours.
I was certain Ronnie would be exhausted. She did not speak the whole
time. Neither did I. What was there to say?

When we reach the top and were on level ground, another conveyance
brought us underneath an enormous roofed area. I remembered the large
portico in the image Christabel showed us. We walked toward the large
imposing doors shut against the dark and stormy night.

As we approached, they swung open silently to admit us. We stepped
through. The doors closed silently. It was as if we were the only
people on the planet and the machinery was still in working order.

I expected the hotel to smell of rot and age. It did not. The air was
clean and fresh. The rugs underneath my paws were thick and clean.
There was no sign of decay anywhere. The lobby on Shepheard's Hotel in
Ptolemy City,
the grandest hotel I had ever seen, seemed small in comparison to this
lobby. Unlike that lobby, this one was totally empty and silent.

Ronnie and I had not exchanged a word. It seemed like to do so would
violate the silence of this place. Was this part of its sacred nature?
I remembered then that Christabel had said the name of Planet X was
sacred but there was no evidence that any sacred places existed on the
planet or that any rites had been performed there. The planet's
purpose was a mystery except that plants and animals lived there. No
intelligent life forms had ever been found. The plants and animals who
lived on the surface and in the oceans were not particularly vicious
and there was no record of any people being attacked. More or less, it
was safe if unoccupied.

We walked toward the hotel desk. Detective Ronnie Camberwell steadied
herself by laying her hand on my shoulder. The plush of the rug made
it difficult for her to keep her balance after the ride up in the
funicular.

"They did not have automatic check in?" I asked.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "The instructions said to go
to the desk."

"No one is there," I said.

"Perhaps there is a screen," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. 

Detective Ronnie Camberwell sounded doubtful. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell sounded very tired and a little bit scared. I was tired,
too, and definitely unnerved by the silence. I kept listening, but I
heard only the wind and rain outside. The thunder was intermittent.
That meant the lightning persisted though we could not see it from
inside the lobby.

On the desk stood a sign--a printed sign. It read: RING FOR SERVICE.
Next to the printed sign was a bell. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
reached out and touched the bell. Its pleasant peal filled the lobby
with sound.

"How quaint," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"I have read about such signs and such bells in old terry stories," I
said. "I would not think any terries have ever been here except you."

"I've read that humanoid technology is very much the same from one
race to another," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I wonder if this
bell does anything."

We looked around. The desk was large and made of beautiful wood. We
saw no indication of how we could ascertain our room assignment.
Perhaps we should just claim one. Except for the people Detective
Ronnie Camberwell had come to protect, there probably was not anyone
else here.

The door behind the desk opened and someone came slowly toward the
desk. By its movements, I realized it was a mechanical object--a
robot. I had read about robots, but I had never seen one.

It said, "Welcome to Hotel Vista Incredible. How may I serve you?"

Its voice was understandable but quite gravely.

"I am Ronnie Camberwell," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "This is
my companion Captain Star Runner. We made a reservation."

"I have a record of your reservation, detective," the robot said. "You
and Captain Star Runner have the Mountain View Suite on Level Five.
Please take the lift to that level and proceed to your left. Room
service is available at all times. Please let us know how else we may
serve you."

And with that invitation, the robot reversed its steps and exited the
lobby through the same door behind the desk it had just come through.

For a few seconds Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I stood there in
silence.

"Why did we have to come to the desk for that?" Detective Ronnie
Camberwell asked. "We could have been sent that message."

"I believe we were scanned," I said. 

"Scanned? How do you know that?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Through my AI relay," I said. "Did you notice that the robot called
you Detective?"

"Yes," Detective Ronnie  Camberwell said. "So much for my wanting to
operate anonymously."

"You probably still can," I said. "I doubt that robot is much of a conversationalist." 
  
Chapter Five: A Scream in the Night
-----------------------------------

Planet X, Hotel Vista Incredible: evening local time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


We used the lift. We could have gone up the staircase, but our luggage
could not have followed. I have never walked up five flights of
stairs. I will have to try going up and down this staircase before I
leave Hotel Vista Incredible. The staircase is broad with elaborately
carved banisters and newel posts. It rises from the lobby floor two
whole stories until it disappears behind a wall. A long balcony or
gallery runs across the lobby. Rooms on the upper floors open to this
open area. 

Our vista suite also opened onto one of these galleries. When we found
the appropriate door, there was no palm lock or scanner. Instead there
was a metal plate with another metal rod sticking out of it. We both
studied this for some time.

"Christabel says this is a key," I announced. "We are to turn it."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell was far more suited to turning the key
with her hand than I was with my paw. I would need to practice the
movement so I could come and go as I pleased.

When we stepped into the spacious main room, we understood why the
hotel was called Hotel Vista Incredible and why this was a Vista
Suite.
Many structures of unknown purpose line the unnamed river. It is
believed more structures lie amidst the mountains. The exact date and
extent of these structures is unknown, but archaeologists theorize
that the people who once occupied Planet X built them for their
royalty. They also theorize they once held great treasures, but the
treasures are no longer present."

"That sounds like a familiar story," Detective Ronnie Camberwell
commented.

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"People stole the treasure a long time ago," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said. "The only artifacts that are left are those things
they couldn't pack up and move."

"That appears to be correct," Christabel said.

Christabel spoke to us through the mini AI regulator integrated into
the skin just above my collar bone. It regulated my biological systems
when I was away from my ride and contained a very small subset of
information I could access if I found myself beyond Christabel's
communication range. While I was in range, Christabel could use the AI
to interface with my biological systems and exchange data with me. It
was sometimes slow and usually very frustrating, but it allowed me to
leave my ride on such outings as this one.


The opposite wall of the main room was entirely clear. Beyond it was
an open-air balcony. Beyond that was the view.

The ground fell away steeply to a valley. Across the valley were
mountains--range after range of mountains. We both gasped. It was like
standing in mid air with the valley far below us. 

We could see all of this because of flood lights strategically placed. Some
glinted off what must be water far below in the valley. Later we were
to learn this was a river.

Christabel found literature describing the scene.

"These are the sacred mountains and valley of the Chukquirey,"
Christabel narrated. "Little is known about what the Chukquirey is--a
people, a deity, a belief, a state of being. People came to the Hotel
Vista Incredible to imbibe the chukquirey. By imbibe they meant drink
in or embody the chukquirey.  

.. ADMONITION:: Note to Self

          How can Detective Ronnie Camberwell and Captain Star Runner
	  see anything if it is a dark and stormy night. Perhaps it
	  would be better to find another way for them to experience
	  the incredible vistas while not yet seeing it for
	  themselves. It is important for them to understand their
	  balcony is the only thing between them and a precipitous
	  drop to the valley floor. The Hotel Vista Incredible is both
	  breath-taking in its views and very dangerous.

While I processed the information Christabel placed into our shared
memory, Detective Ronnie Camberwell stepped into an alcove along one
wall.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

"Exploring the kitchen," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I think I
can order us a meal.A"

I checked with Christabel. A meal would be in order.

"Do you have to prepare it?" I asked. This hotel seemed so antiquated
I was beginning to think it had been a mistake to come here.

"No," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I just have to figure out the
instructions. Please come here. Perhaps you or  Christabel can read
them more clearly than I can. My basic language skills are pretty good
but these are not written by a native speaker."

They certainly were not. Together we puzzled them out, pressed the
appropriate buttons, twists the appropriate knobs and basically pushed,
pulled, twisted and slid controls until hot steaming trays of food
appeared. We ordered too much food or we reordered food we had already
selected. Detective Ronnie Camberwell said there was a way to preserve
the food and reheat it later so we ate as much as we wanted and stored
the rest. Christabel, as usual, tut-tutted about what I ate. My mini
AI was not as well equipped as Christabel was to adjust my biochemical
levels. I felt quite uncomfortable when I was finished eating.
Christabel said my stomach was over filled and I was feeling stuffed.
That was quite a good adjective to describe the feeling. I promptly
curled up on the floor and went to sleep.

Hotel Vista Incredible: Evening Local Time: Ronnie Narrates
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. ANN"OTATION:: Note to Self
          The headings in this novel are all screwed up. I won't take
	  the time right now to fix them but I definitely need a
	  better system than what I have here.

I watched Captain Star Runner sleep. She has no idea, I think, that I
love to watch her sleep. Star Runner curls herself up into a very
tight circle, her nose in between her paws, her tail tucked alongside
her paws and chin. She makes little snuffling noises. When she dreams,
her paws and ears twitch. Her nose scents the air. 

I know Pantherans, Members of the Race, do not like to be referred to
as cats, but sleeping on the rug, Captain Star Runner looked very much
like a cat--a very big cat, but a cat all the same.

I knew I should figure out where my charges were in the building and
check in on them. I just did not have the energy. I am not a good
space traveler. The descent through the atmosphere had been
harrowing. I could feel the spaceship buffeted by the intense winds.
The landing had been bumpy. The landing area was in poor repair. All
the conveyances we had used, the transport to the funicular, the
funicular itself and the transfer to the hotel's portico were all
ramshackle. They lurched, bumped and swayed mercilessly. I was sure
throughout the entire two-hour ride up the mountainside that the train
would come tumbling down the rails and kill us both. I was fearful
about descending the mountain. The ascent had been terrifying.

The meal was excellent. I ate not anything approaching the quantity
that Star Runner ate, but I was just about as content as she was.

I must have drifted off where I sat in one of the overstuffed chairs
near the clear wall overlooking the valley and the mountain ranges
beyond because I jerked awake. Captain Star Runner was on her feet,
all her fur puffed out.

"What?" I asked.

"A scream," Captain Star Runner said. "A human scream if I am not
mistaken."

My stomach clenched. One of my charges, no doubt, and here I was
asleep in a chair after a hearty meal.

I got to my feet.

"I have to go," I said.

"I will come with you," Star Runner said.

"No," I said.

"Yes," she said.

"You can't--" I began.

"Yes, I can protect us," Captain Star Runner said.

There was no point in arguing with her. It would be quicker to just
go.

"I think you will find the room in question on the third level,"
Christabel said through Star Runner's gem.

It seemed as good an idea as any.

I threw open our door and hurried to the staircase. I could take the
steps two at a time with my long legs and hurried along the gallery. I
did not bother to close or lock our door.. If Star Runner thought of
it, she could struggle with the key. I certainly had no interest or
time to fiddle with such an archaic contraption. It might be artful.
It might be quaint. But it was certainly inconvenient and a nuisance.

Star Runner followed behind more slowly. If I had given it any
thought, I knew she would have liked to jump from landing to landing
in a grand gesture of Pantheran agility and skill. Fortunately, the
mini AI backed by Christabel prevailed. Flamboyant gestures can be
well-executed. They can also be foolish and dangerous. Captain Star
Runner was not used to this gravity and had not trained in normal G
situations. Her acrobatics aboard her spaceship were impressive but
they were performed at either 0G or close to it. Her excellent muscle
tone was maintained through Christabel's ministrations. Members of the
Race believed in both healthy bodies and healthy minds. Even so, Star
Runner was well-advised to precede with caution when it came to stairs
designed for humanoids.

Light emerged from underneath one door along the gallery. I ran toward
it. Fortunately, it was unlocked. I threw it open.

This was not one of the vista suites. In fact, it was hardly more than
a closet. A young man was kneeling alongside a young woman. She was
not moving. He was saying her name over and over again. "Suri."
"Suri." "Suri." She was not moving.

"Is she dead?" I asked, still standing in the doorway.

The young man was startled. He looked up at me with fear.

"I'm Ronnie Camberwell," I said. "Is Suri dead?"

"I don't know," the young man said. "I don't know how to tell."

"What happened?" I asked, not moving from the doorway.

"I heard a scream," he said. "I came into the room. She was like
this."

"And you are?" I asked.

"Heracles. Heracles Beja."

Well, here were the two people I came here to protect. One of them
might be dead.

"Are you the only ones in the room?" I asked.

"I don't know," he said, looking wildly around. "Do you think there's
someone else here?"

"She screamed for a reason," I said.

I was unarmed. Hotel regulations prohibited weapons. I needed to do a
search.

No one else was in the tiny room. And Suri was dead.

Chapter Six: Down in the Valley
-------------------------------

Planet X: The next day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. ADMONITION:: Note to Self

		          Some way of denoting time is necessary. The
			  next day may not be sufficient.
			  Alternatively, I can delete any reference to
			  place and time and just go with chapter
			  numbers and names if possible.

To keep it simple, I will summarize what happened during the rest of evening.

1. The robot concierge confirmed that the two archiology students,
   Detective Ronnie Camberwell and I were the only ones registered at
   the Hotel Vista Incredible. The robot concierge additionally
   confirmed that we were the only living beings in the hotel.

2. This left Detective Ronnie Camberwell weighing the possibility that
   Hericles Beja had killed Suri Nam, but after questioning the living
   archiology student, Detective Ronnie Camberwell believed him when
   he said 	he had not killed Suri Nam. What reason, he asked
   reasonably, would he have to kill her. They had worked together for
   two standard years on their project. They were both concerned what
   their impact their findings would have on the archiological
   community in the primary arm and had reached out for protection.
   They did not stand to profit either academically or financially from their research and their conclusions, so he would have no reason to eliminate a potential competitor.

   3. The robot concierge also confirmed that no one else had come to
   the Hotel Vista Incredible during the last two standard years.

4. The robot concierge removed Suri Nam's body. It said it would be
   reserved indefinitely.

5. Detective Ronnie Camberwell decided Heracles Beja shold move into
   our Vista Incredible suite. I could take up a guard position by the
   door to the gallery. To my way of thinking, this also meant that I
   was between Detective Ronnie Camberwell's sleeping chamber (That is
   what the Hotel Vista Incredible called it.) and hericles Beja. I
   did not trust him as the exchange which follows shows.
   
"Hericles Beja had to have killed Suri Nam," I told Detective
   Ronnie Camberwell early the next morning. "He is the only one that
   could have done it."

"But it makes no sense for him to do that," Detective Ronnie
   Camberwell insisted.

"If you eliminate the impossible," I quoted, "Then you are left
   with the truth no matter how improbable it may seem." I was very
   proud to produce this quotation from Sherlock Holmes at the proper
   time.

.. ADMONITION:: Note to Self

		             Check the accuracy of the quotation. It
			     does not sound exactly right.

"That's 			     fiction, Star. I believe
Heracles. There has to be something I'm missing here. Suri screamed.
Something frightened her before she died."

"Or Suri Iglesia was in pain."

I was pleased with myself for my contribution. I was convinced
Heracles Beja was the killer from the time I saw him kneeling over Suri
Nam's body. I did not know what his motivation was. It just was the
simplest explanation possible. That is Occam's razor. I had read about
that, too. I could not understand why Detective Ronnie Camberwell
could not see it.

.. ADMONITION:: Note to Self

		If the first chapter tells of how Heracles is about to kill Ronnie, then it is no secret to the reader who killed Suri. Star Runner can narrate its convictions without spoiling the plot to that point. However, for the reader to believe Ronnie's refusal to believe that Heracles did it, she needs a plausible explanation for disbelief now and in the future.

		Ah! The oldest trick in the book, maybe literally. If Heracles is the one who is killed, then Ronnie can be taken in by Suri's vulnerability and attractiveness. The scream can be hers, made up to convince Ronnie of some mysterious stranger or thing that killed Heracles. She can weave a story about it that Ronnie believes but Star Runner does not.

		This has the advantage of creating tension between Ronnie and Star Runner, a convenient state of affairs to any reader of the story arc. These two are both attracted to one another and yet they are chronically attracted to others. Star does not like Suri Iglesia and does not trust her. Ronnie is sexually attracted to Suri Iglesia and struggles to be both professional and monogamous with Star Runner.  
		

Usually it is I who goes off believing things to be different than
they really are. I have made many mistakes of this kind though I have
ironclad explanations for why I was so badly misled in the first
place.  

"I still do not like it," I said.

"That is your prerogative." Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

I had to leave it there.

Planet X: The next day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suri Iglesia was adamant that we visit a particular ancient structure
on the valley floor. I was not eager to repeat our descent down the
mountain. Suri Iglesia said we would not take the funicular. There was
a maglif tram.

What she did not tell us was how we were to get to the tram.

A large basket lowered us down the sheer face of the cliff on which
Hotel Vista Incredible perched. My only comfort was knowing that if
one of the cables snapped, Suri Iglesia would also be killed. As a
Member of the Race, I am not bothered by heights and my genetic
engineering makes me indifferent to orientations in weightless
environments. Detective Ronnie Camberwell, on the other hand, clung
desperately onto the provided poles, huddling her large body on the
floor as she did so. Detective Ronnie Camberwell closed her eyes. So
much for providing protection during the long drop. As a result, she
missed the credible vistas. I believe the Hotel Vista Incredible
literature called these views bird's eye and referred to them as
spellbinding. I would not know. I have nothing to compare them to.  

After The Drop, we boarded a tram. For a long time we switchbacked
up and down the mountainsides until we reached a depot on the valley floor.

incredible. With no other living beings planet side, all this equipment
continued to be maintained. Suri Iglesia selected a wheeled vehicle
and we bounced along a roadway Suri Iglesia referred to as the River
Walk. I did not comment on the strangeness of riding in a vehicle on a
road called a walk.

"Do you see those mounds along the river?" Suri Iglesia asked, waving
her arm at no particular mound but taking in all of the area we
passed.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell replied in the affirmative.

"Heracles and I investigated a number of them. We believe there was a
raised walkway along the river. Pedestrians could go into many
structures along the way."

"Where they houses?"

"Possibly. We thought they might bee eating establishments or other
facilities that attended to travelers. We think the structures I am
taking you to may have been for worship. Pilgrims came here and needed
food, rest and recreation."

"What about the Hotel Vista Incredible?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell
asked.

"That may have been for more affluent visitors," Suri Iglesia said as
she swerved violently to avoid a pothole.

"But your room was tiny," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

"Agreed. Yours is much nicer. However, the People who stayed in those
cubbyholes could use the hotel's facilities and they only had to go to
the observation lounges to see the views. That's a small price to pay
for those views. Heracles and I speculated that there was some value
in the views themselves. Perhaps just looking out at the views
enhanced your virtue or gave you some special spiritual insights."

"Or maybe," Detective Ronnie Camberwell put in, "just having the gumption to go up that mountain
gave you spiritual credits."

"Could be." Suri Iglesia sounded noncommittal. Perhaps Detective Ronnie
Camberwell's remarks did not fit into Suri Iglesia's vision and
thereby was discounted. Suri Iglesia definitely liked to be in charge
and now there was no one to dispute with her opinions. I wondered how
long it would be before *Heracles and I* was replaced with *I*.

We stepped inside one of the stone structures on the other side of the
avenue from the slowly flowing river. It was cool and dark and smelled
occupied.

"This is where Heracles and I have been working," Suri Iglesia explained,
lighting the interior.

The room had a vaulted ceiling. The doorways leading from it were both
high and wide like the one we had entered.

"We speculate the people who built these structures were larger than
we are." Suri Iglesia continued her explanation. "It is commonly held that
these structures were some sort of religious shrines, possibly for the
dead or they were concerned with an after life. Other structures have vast
murals in very poor condition so we can't fully follow the story line." 


"All this has been documented for some time," I said, pulling
information from my mini AI which was being updated constantly by
Christabel. Christabel had been able to patch into communication
satellites that ringed the planet. Why Planet X had such a
sophisticated and state-of-the-art communication arrays was a mystery
to both of us. There was something going on here that was not obvious.

Suri Iglesia gave me a pitying look.

"That is what is said officially."

I waited for Suri Iglesia to enlighten us while Detective Ronnie
Camberwell kept looking around as if the explanation would walk
through one of the doorways.

"I made extensive tests of the paint on these figures." Suri Iglesia
pointed to a long line of figures walking along the avenue. They
looked very familiar to me but I could not quite remember. That is the
problem with the mini AI. It has tables of memories stored back on my
ride. I need to send a request to Christabel to access them and send
them back. There is a bit of a delay in this process. I am just
grateful it works at all. Without this methodology of retrieving my
memories, I would be knowing I knew something without actually knowing
it.


Then Christabel got back to me. The figures in the mural were
trollolu, a race that had not existed for twenty thousand years.

I marveled that Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not recognize the
reptilian race. We had seen pictures of them in the Prince Hat Star
System where my dear friend Tamara had been working
on an archaeological dig. In our adventure which I chronicled in
*Landscape of Thorns*, we learned the Trollolu were an ancient, now
extinct, race who had trained the Members of the Race, The Featherote
Charm and the Fungusian Network. They had been annihilated by a race
which called itself Followers of the Stars. The Followers of the Star
were contemporaries of the Empire of the Rainbow Sky, one of the
oldest races here in the Primary Arm. The Trollolu and the Followers
of the Stars lived in the western spiral arm where both Detective
Ronnie Camberwell and I came from. 

Bottom line: What were pictures of the Trollolu doing in this
structure?

Christabel cautioned me not to say anything. With a murderer in our
midst, knowledge could sign our death warrants. I kept silent. This is
something I am not usually good at, but protecting my own life and
that of Detective Ronnie Camberwell is genetically encoded in me. A
star runner is responsible for its crew when no other Member of the
Race is present.

I directed Christabel to block my ability to discuss the Trollolus
with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. This is a handy technique for
keeping confidential information secret. Genderless Members of the
Race make very good spies and couriers. The interrogator would have to
have the skills to redirect the AI. Built into the algorithm are the
directives for the AI to break the embargo on its own.

.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

         This circumstance will result in Ronnie not having a piece of
	 critical information later when she needs it. Christabel fails
	 to recognize Ronnie's need for it, too. This will reinforce
	 Ronnie's distrust of Christabel's attitude toward her. This
	 in turn will upset Captain Star Runner. it is not clear to me
	 at this juncture whether I need to resolve this ongoing
	 triangle to some state of equilibrium before the end of the novel.


 
i BECAME SO INVOLVED LOOKING AT THE trollolu THAT i FORGOT TO KEEP MY
ATTENTION FOCUSED ON detective Ronnie camber Bell and Suri Iglesia.
When I refocused on them, I saw their heads close together while Suri
Iglesia continued to talk with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Their body
language had changed. I am still no expert at reading humanoid body
language, but it was clear to me that both women enjoyed the close
contact. Instinctively I puffed up. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was my
lover. How dare this interloper take liberties with Detective Ronnie
Camberwell. But as I watched and listened, my body regained its
natural dimensions and I felt as if it pulled into itself. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell liked Suri Iglesia's attentions and was drawing
closer to her. Unlike the humanoids, I could smell the fenestration in
the that each emitted. Suri Iglesia was not faking her attraction to
Detective Ronnie Camberwell. It was real.

I literally sat back on my haunches. This meant, if I understood
gendered humanoid interactions well enough, that any objection I would
raise to Detective Ronnie Camberwell about Suri Iglesia  would be
brushed away categorically.

Now I had three problems on my paws:

1. Suri Iglesia was a murderer. Murderers found it easy to kill again.

2. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was attracted to Suri Iglesia. Thus
   far, although Detective Ronnie Camberwell found humanoid females
   attractive and often engaged in sexual activities with them, she
   found it impossible to fully bond with them. Detective Ronnie
   Camberwell always came back to me. But would she do that this time?
   Could I stop Suri Iglesia from both steeling my lover and killing
   her in time?

3. How should I proceed? If I understood the course of humanoid
   attraction, I would increasingly be an inconvenience. More and more
   the two women would want to spend time alone. What should I do?

Christabel remained silent. This was a bit surprising. Even after
thinking this thought, Christabel did not comment. I could solicit her
input, of course, but I could also think about it by myself. The
relationship between Christabel and Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
complicated and often contentious. Christabel wanted to integrate
Detective Ronnie Camberwell's thoughts into Christabel's dataset.
Detective Ronnie Camberwell objected strongly to this integration,
wanting to keep her thoughts and feelings quite separate. 

Not for the first time I wondered if this integration disturbed
Detective Ronnie Camberwell because we are not species compatible. I
can exist because Christabel exists, that is, I am connected to an AI
which maintains my mental, physical and emotional health. I literally
would not stay alive if I was not connected to an AI to sustain me. I
cannot imagine living without an AI in my head. Detective Ronnie
Camberwell cannot imagine living with one inside her head.

We managed to function as a couple for long periods of time and then
it all fell apart. This had happened several times. We got together
again after each episode, but sitting in the stone structure on Planet
X, I wondered how many times we could play out that scenario before we
finally could not come together again. Would it be this time? Would it
be our decision or would Suri Iglesia make that decision for us?

"What do you want to do?" Christabel finally spoke.

"What do you mean?" I had been so immersed in my own thoughts that
Christabel startled me. That is hard to do.

"How do you want to proceed with Detective Ronnie Camberwell?"

"I do not understand the question," I finally said.

"You have options in any relationship. You could:

a. Resist Suri Iglesia's advances either directly or indirectly.
b. Walk away literally or figuratively.

You are a free agent here, Star Runner. You can do what you think is
right for you."

"So it is flight or fight," I said.

"More or less," Christabel agreed. "How much do you want Detective
Ronnie Camberwell to be your monogamous lover? You could keep her as a
friend. You could look after her well-being. Tamara is your friend and
is not your lover. The Czarina is your friend and not your lover."

I knew the list of former lovers could go on. Whether all of them were
still my friends is another question. Right now my focus was on
monogamy. If I am telling the truth here, and I try to tell the truth
in these adventures, I have not always been monogamous. Space journeys
are long. Detective Ronnie Camberwell has often objected to my
pornographic database for other genderless Members of the Race. It is
typically a subscription plan. We can sample scenarios that get played
out in our minds with hooks into our AIs for the physical components.
I make frequent use of it myself as well as playing out private
recordings of my interactions with Detective Ronnie Camberwell. She
finds these solitary reenactments creepy. This is because they are
stored in memory where Christabel is a part of them. I have pointed
out to Detective Ronnie Camberwell many times that there would be no
lovemaking at all if it were not for Christabel managing my pleasure
at what Detective Ronnie Camberwell was doing or pretending to do with
my body. I have no physical pleasure centers. It is all controlled via
my AI.

"I am the only AI Detective Ronnie Camberwell has ever known,"
Christabel observed. "I think it could be different if Detective
Ronnie Camberwell did not think of me as a person but as a computer
program without any personality."

I did not respond to this observation. I continued to watch and
therefore record the interaction of the two women. I also continued to
puzzle over the appearance of the Trollolu in the mural. I wondered
what other races I would find in other murals on other walls in other
structures. I determined to have a look at them if at all possible.
This would limit my ability to watch over Detective Ronnie Camberwell
if Suri Iglesia and Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not want to
accompany me.

"We need that information," Christabel announced. "I suspect that you
can suggest it and if they think you are not watching them too
closely, it will be a cover for them to continue to spend time
together without, they think, being too noticeable. Both races of
humanoid value monogamy. They may well see their growing relationship
as illicit."

I hoped so. This would mean Detective Ronnie Camberwell had not ended
our relationship.

"It is also dangerous," Christabel chided me. "illicit relationships
are conducted in secret. The need for obfuscation grows. Detective
Ronnie Camberwell may start lying to you to cover her time and
activities with Suri Iglesia. You need to be prepared for this."

This really meant Christabel would be stepping up her boo management.
I needed to make some decisions about how Christabel did this. If I
gave my AI no instructions, her directives remained to keep me in top
physical, mental and emotional health. This could even mean
reorganizing my memories. I could lose my desire to be in a
relationship with Detective Ronnie Camberwell if Christabel thought it
would be a healthier option for me.

My confusion at this juncture made it impossible for me to modify
those directives.

.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

        Captain Star Runner's ambivalence here will have an impact
	from this point forward on its decision-making process.
	Captain Star Runner has failed to give Christabel a definitive
	instruction to maintain its desire to stay committed to
	Detective Ronnie Camberwell. Christabel's overriding directive
	is the health and well-being of her charge. Given the
	enhancements the People of the Rainbow Sky did to their
	systems in *Sanctuary*, their bond has been strengthened and
	Christabel is more protective than ever. No attempt was made
	in the upgrade and the maintenance done by the Fungusian
	network to give Christabel any understanding of the nature of
	a paired relationship. Any ongoing relationship with its ups
	and downs threatens Captain Star Runner's equilibrium and
	therefore requires Christabel to make corrections and
	interventions.

 

I refocused on the women's conversation.

"The accepted historical arc is that a race of humanoids controlled
this planet," Suri Iglesia was saying, "and built these structures
and everything you can see along the River Walk. They were advanced.
We can see that in the hotel and with their communications systems."

"Where are they now?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"They left for some reason." Suri Iglesia did not seem overly
interested in the question. "What my research shows is that they
weren't the first people on this planet." She pointed to the Trollolu.
"These must have been the original people here on the planet who built
these structures."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell looked at the blurred representations of
the Trollolu. Apparently she did not recognize them. Christabel
advised me that she had superimposed all of the figure outlines to
demonstrate that what these individual paintings had originally shown
were a line of Trollolu. I studied the mural again. What was happening
here?

"I've never seen anything like these people," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell was saying. "They look ugly to me."

In a superior tone Suri Iglesia said, "They don't appear to be
humanoid. I suppose that is why you think hey are ugly. For all we
know, this might have been a beauty pageant."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell shook her head. Then she turned to me.

"Captain Star Runner,   what do you think?"

What could I say? I had stopped Christabel from allowing me to
say,"Those are Trollolu. Do not you recognize them?" But there was
something I could say, was not there?

"Are there any other kind of figures?" I asked. It was always better
to answer a question with a question.

"Why would there be any other kind of figures?" Suri Iglesia dismissed
my question out of hand as if I was particularly stupid.

Detective Ronnie Camberwell, on the other hand, took my question
seriously. "What do you mean, other figures, Captain Star Runner?"

The use of my honorific could mean two entirely different things:

1. Detective Ronnie Camberwell was distancing herself from me and being
   more formal.
2. Detective Ronnie Camberwell had heard  Suri Iglesia's slight and
   was reminding Suri Iglesia that I was not some stupid animal but
   an intelligent and competent alien.

I said, "There are many races in the Primary Arm. I just wondered who
else these aliens might have known."

Although she was an archaeologist, Suri Iglesia demonstrated her
narrowest of vision with her next observation. "The Empire of the
People of the Rainbow Sky and the Lystran Empire are the oldest races.
No doubt these were some aliens from long ago. It really doesn't
matter. What matters is the age of this structure. It must have been
built by either empire. I intend to find out which."

The Trollolu were an ancient people. The Followers of the Stars were
an even more ancient people. The Members of the Race, the Fungusian
Network and the Featherote Charm are also ancient. Terries are a
fairly new race. The Rabbit People and those who came from the planet
where I was incarcerated in Sanctuary XI are recent races. I did not
know the proveniences of the races that made up the Space Traders
Guild. All these different people and Suri Iglesia could only think of
two possibilities.

I checked my records. Yes, Suri Iglesia was Lystran. I suspected her
final determination would have a lot to do with whether or not she
wanted to claim these structures as part of her own heritage or not.
The fact that they had been abandoned might mitigate against her
claiming them.

The question for me in this matter was, Who maintained this planet?
That might go along way to answering all the questions about who
really built this place and why there was a cover up.
			     
Chapter 7: Figures on the Wall
------------------------------



Ronnie Narrates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am a professional. I have worked on a police force. I have been a
private investigator. I have been working as an assistant to an
enforcer. I know my job. 

The most important rule of my job is not to get personally involved.
It distorts your view and compromises your integrity in so many ways.

When I saw Suri Iglesia kneeling next to the body of Heracles Beja, I
lost my professionalism. I lost my ability to be objective. Suri
Iglesia took my breath away. I was immediately  smitten. I did not
want to be attracted to a client. I did not want to be enamored of anyone else
besides Captain Star Runner, my own true love. Yet I was bewitched. I
cannot give any other explanation for my behavior. I have no defense
for what happened and no excuses for my behavior.

Suri Iglesia was everything I physically desire in a woman: 

* fragile-looking
* small wrists
* slender
* dark-haired
* long straight hair worn loose.

As a Lystran, she wore long skirts and a high-necked, long-sleeved
over shirt. These garments hid the outline of her body. My imagination
filled in a tiny waist and rounded hips. Her nose and chin were a bit
pointy for my human taste, but those points are highly desired in
Lystran society. The average individual has a very broad face.
Heracles Beja had a broad face.

"I think he is dead," were the first words I heard Suri Iglesia
speak. She spoke the basic spacer language with a soft voice and some
accent which sounded exotic to my ears.

I knew my space basic was very accented. Jack Whicher said it
made me sound very formidable. With my large hands and feet, my large
and awkward body this gave me what I thought of as a brutish demeanor.
I compensate by being in good physical condition. Although Captain
Star Runner will call me beautiful, I think of myself as very plain
with good skin and a direct gaze. My mouth is too big for my face.

As I looked at her, I could not imagine Suri Iglesia killing Heracles
Beja. How I could have continued to believe in her innocence still
baffles me. Captain Star Runner was right. Who else could have killed
him? Suri Iglesia was the only other living being on the planet who
could have done it. Captain Star Runner had not killed him. I had not
killed him. The robot concierge could not have killed him. Why did I
continue to believe in some unknown other killer?

It has to do with my reason for being on Planet X in the first place.
I have not said much about this until now. The background on the
contract may explain a little why I was willing to believe in Suri
Iglesia's innocence for so long. 

 I need to say a bit about how Half Moon Bay Space Station is governed
 and policed.

Only people who have a connection to those who founded the Space
Traders Guild are allowed to participate in the governance of the
space station. Half Moon Bay Space Station is huge. There are a number
of pods, each of which has its own local authority. The space guilders
take turns governing. Each local authority sends representatives to
the Space Station Council. Because very few Space Guilders have the
luxury of giving all their time to carrying out their governmental
duties, they hire non-Space Guilders like Jack Whicher and me to
perform such functions as sanitation, pod maintenance, revenue
collection and education. They reserve defense for themselves though
they can and do hire mercenaries as needed.

Jack Whicher is an enforcer. He collects overdue revenues. I work for
him. Although the title sounds as if we physically threaten people,
this is usually unnecessary and is frowned upon by the Space Station
Council. We have the authority to incarcerate and to impound. It is a
job that mostly requires being tough most of the time and figuring out
how to obtain payment. Jack Whicher has a reputation of being fair.
This helps a lot. 

From time to time, we get requests for other policing tasks. I usually
take these on since my background gives me the skill set for
investigation. Mostly I deal with thievery though occasionally there
is a threat of physical violence.

One day when I reported for work, Jack waved me over to his display.

"What do you think of this?" he asked, pointing at the message.

I saw from his hand held that the message had been translated from
Lystran.

"I thought the Guilders didn't do business with the Lystrans," I said.

"Guilders do business with anybody," Jack said. "They are traders.
That is why your Captain Star Runner gets on with them so well. They
are all pirates at heart."

"But isn't there a war going on?"

"Oh, yeah, there are some skirmishes. Lystra thinks it is still an
empire. It's trying to flex its muscles, but it's so old and sick it
can barely get out of its own way. The People of the Golden Sun have
made inroads, and the People of the Rainbow Sky have tried to get back
the territories--it's just an excuse for flashy spaceships and a lot
of saber rattling. It's quite localized and has no effect on us."

That was not what Christabel had told me, but I am always disinclined
to trust everything Christabel says. I know she is an artificial
intelligence, but I am convinced she is biased and often is biased
against me.

Christabel had said it was a serious conflict In her scanning of many
news outlets and some back channel conversations, a real power
struggle was underway. It could change the politics in our area of the
Primary Arm for many years to come. Christabel believed several races
would divide Lystra up and depending on how that shook out, free trade
might be compromised. This was of great interest to the Space Traders
Guild and they were having back channel conversations with all the
major players and a number of minor ones as well. There had been
equilibrium in the Primary Arm for many millenia. The deterioration
of the Lystran Empire and the emergence of the radical People of the
Golden Sun was changing the balance of power. No one knew if the old
Empire of the Rainbow Sky had enough power any more to settle the
dispute definitively.

I did not have an opinion. I was here at Half Moon Bay Space Station
because Captain Star Runner was here. Both of us were deface exiles
from our own galactic arm. We hoped that staying here for a while
might make it possible for us to return some day.

I read what Jack was showing me.

"Let me get this straight. Someone from Lystra has contacted you to
protect two archeology students on some deserted planet?"

"Not just any deserted planet, Ronnie. We're talking about Planet X."

"Is it really called Planet ?"

"I'm sure it has a name, but everyone calls it Planet X. It's haunted.
Perhaps treasure is buried there. No one knows. No one goes there.
It's bad luck to go there."

"So why did these students go there and why do they need protection
from ghosts?"

"That's not the point, Ronnie." Jack wiggled his fingers. "This is an
official request for assistance and it comes with a sizable payment
from one of the student's family. I did a little checking. They're an
old family, down on their luck a bit as is the whole Lystran Empire,
but they're legitimate. Their daughter is legitimate. There is some
story about special research and fear of academic reprisals. It should
be a piece of cake. Just go there as if it is a holiday. You can make a
bundle which ought to make your cat friend happy."

I had never told Jack Captain Star Runner and I were lovers. He is a
bit prudish when it comes to that kind of interspecies relationships.

"I thought you said no one goes to Planet X."

"Oh, there's a fancy hotel. It's a dare some people take. People will
think you're adventurous if you go there. It's a bit --" he waved his
hand not finding the right expression. "It will give you some
cashette."

The contract was generous indeed. The payment would be all mine if I
went. I would have to compensate Captain Star Runner in some way, sell
her on the idea. She did not like it that it was all secret until I
safely removed my charges from Planet X, but the thought of having me
on board with her pleased Captain Star Runner very much.

But here I was, standing in the doorway where both my charges were and
one of them was dead. Fortunately, it was the male. My contract was
with the female's family. No romantic involvement had been referred
to. 

My snap decision, based on what I thought of at the time was an
objective viewpoint, was to protect Suri Iglesia and earn my fee. What
I should have done was walk away and forfeit the fee. Captain Star
Runner and I should have gone back to Half Moon Bay Space Station and
forgotten there ever was a contract. Maybe we even should have gone
back to the western galactic arm and the Northern Frontier.

But that is not what happened.    

So there I was, standing next to Suri Iglesia, wishing Captain Star
Runner would leave the building so I could hold Suri Iglesia in my
arms and run my hands all over her. I was quivering all over, or at
least that is what I felt like. Star was acting strangely. She was
somehow distant but also judgmental, an Erie combination. I felt she
was hovering, not allowing me to do my job. Her opinion that Suri had
killed Heracles was simply outrageous and one of the irritating
erroneous judgments about humanoids Star is often prone to make.

The figures on the wall fascinated me. I never saw their resemblance
to the Trollolu holograms I had seen in the Prince Hat Star System.
What impressed me here was the detail of the surviving pieces of the
mural. After all this time, the artwork was still breathtaking. What
must these figures on the wall looked like when they were freshly
drawn?

"Are there more figures like this anywhere else?" I asked. I was
trying to think of something intelligent to say. I did not want Suri
to think I was just big muscle. I wanted her to think I was someone
she could treat as an equal, someone she wanted to be with. I wondered
if she could possibly be attracted to me. I hoped she was but I could
not tell. If only Star would pad outside, I could take the risk of
touching her.

"I do not know," Suri said. She sounded disinterested. "I had to run
many tests on this mural. When I made the discovery about its extreme
age, I had to document everything in great detail so I can publish
it."

"What do you think it means?" I asked, trying to sound spellbound. I
do not do overawed well.

"I think it means the Empire of the Rainbow Sky has been lying for
millenia," Suri Iglesia said. "When I release this information, the
whole Primary Arm will know how underhanded they are."

The political implications of this discovery had not occurred to me.
What should have occurred to me was that Lystra was an old enemy of
the People of the Rainbow Sky. I did not know much about either of
them. Captain Star Runner was positively disposed toward the Empire of
the Rainbow Sky. Perhaps that was why she was so skeptical of Suri. I
could not recall all the details of Star's interaction with the People
of the Rainbow Sky. I suspected Star had not told the whole story to
me. Star often left bits out, always casting herself as the heroine of
her adventures. I know these people had done something to Star. She
was just a bit different when she returned. I wondered now if it was
some sort of mind control, something that both Star Runner and
Christabel were imprisoned by. That must be why Star Runner was so
adamant that Suri must have killed Heracles.

Now that I had an explanation for Star's behavior, I must guard
against being entrapped by the same skewed thinking. 

Chapter 8: Explorations
-----------------------

Captain Star Runner Narrates
~~~

.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

                 I am still struggling with narrator voice. When
		 Captain Star Runner narrates in the first person, the
		 narration is quirky with lots of asides and Captain
		 Star Runner's opinions and assumptions on many
		 topics. The first person allows Captain Star Runner
		 to simply be. The pronouns do not get in the way.
		 Captain Star Runner is simply the "I" of the story.
		 In the third person, "it" would sound strange.
		 Perhaps this would heighten Captain Star Runner's
		 alien self, but Captain Star Runner is not intended
		 to be an alien character, but a lovable character who
		 happens to be an alien.

                 Detective Ronnie Camberwell is a different matter.
		 When she narrates in the first person, it is clear
		 that she is telling the story after the fact. These
		 are not diary entries as they appear here in the
		 first draft. Diary entries are a possibility going
		 forward and as a rewrite. She would be having a
		 conversation with herself in the present of the
		 story.

                 Alternatively, Ronnie's sections could be rewritten
		 and written going forward in the third person. It
		 would again be real time for the character. We could
		 be inside her head, seeing what she sees, knowing
		 only what she knows. 

                 This viewpoint and the omniscient narrator viewpoint
		 have the same problem: Where does this information
		 come from? How does Captain Star Runner have access
		 to it as Captain Star Runner puts together the
		 adventure?

                 On the other hand, diary entries would give that
		 sense of first person narration in real time but,
		 from a practical point of view,  they would be
		 gathered after the fact. Practically speaking again,
		 this means Ronnie trusts Captain Star Runner with
		 them or Captain Star Runner has appropriated them
		 without Ronnie's consent. Both scenarios are
		 consistent with Captain Star Runner's behavior.

                 It is still not clear to me if this story will end
		 with Captain ST Star Runner and Ronnie's relationship
		 back on an even Kiel. If it is not, the explanation
		 of Ronnie's diary entries appearing in the adventure
		 text needs to be explained--at least to me.
		 Presumably this narration is one that Captain Star
		 Runner put together and published. Later Ronnie
		 inserted her diary entries. Why would she do this?

                 This may sound like a pointless excursus into
		 motivations and explanations which really do not
		 matter since this is fiction after all. But a
		 reader's suspension of disbelief only goes so far and
		 it is reasonable for the reader to ask: How is this
		 narration possible? How did all these dis disparate
		 pieces of the story come together. Either some
		 unnamed editor did it or the character themselves did
		 it. Captain Star Runner maintains that it alone
		 creates these adventures. They are self published.
		 Therefore, Captain Star Runner needs access to all
		 the materials in them.

                 In   the three Nanowrimo novels I have written that I
		 have subtitled Ronnie Camberwell Adventures, two of
		 them are first person narratives. The third one, the
		 latest novel I've written, the narration is mixed
		 because the story lagged with first person narrative.
		 Ronnie could not have known some things that were
		 necessary.

                 The same situation exists here.Either I have not
		 conceived of these tales well from the outset or I am
		 growing as a writer, having wider vision of the
		 adventure.

                 For now, I will try the diary entry approach and see
		 where that gets me.Explorations is a good title for this thought experiment and this chapter.

.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

                  I need a clause in the contract that Ronnie has with
		  Suri Iglesia's family. She is to wait and turn
		  responsibility for the students over to a trusted
		  Lystran spaceship captain. That means Ronnie is
		  waiting on Planet X for this captain to arrive. Now
		  that Heracles Beja is dead, Suri Iglesia is anxious
		  to leave Planet X with her data before someone
		  steals it or refutes it. Ronnie will be blindsided
		  by Suri's decision to leave the planet with Heracles
		  Beja's murder still unresolved. Suri will use this
		  ambiguity to justify her decision not to wait for
		  the scheduled ride.

There were some living quarters nearby the old structures. Suri
Iglesia had not told us we were staying down in the valley overnight.
There was a rough sort of dinner. Detective Ronnie Camberwell put and
Suri Iglesia put their clothes in the refresher. They wore loose
garments stored in the facility for just this purpose.

After they were asleep I decided to go exploring. I could not judge
how safe Detective Ronnie Camberwell was. I hoped both women would
just sleep while I was out prowling.

Our old stories say that Members of the Race hunted at dusk and dawn.
We see very well then. We are also creatures of the night. Although I
am born and bred to be in space, I find adjusting to planet night is
not all that difficult. I have all the instinctual moves for stalking
and skulking. I just do not do it with finesse.    
 
I first went to the structure we had previously entered. I wanted to
know what lay behind those doorways. Sadly, the corridors were clogged
with debris. I wondered if Suri Iglesia and Heracles Beja were
required to remove a substantial amount of debris before they could
enter the structure. If that were the case, I could not reconnoiter
other structures.

I worked my way along the avenue, retracing our route from the tram
roundhouse. Doorways were blocked. Roofs were caved in. I was about to
give up and return to the dormitory when I could finally stand inside
a structure.

I looked about the room. It appeared to be identical to the one Suri
Iglesia and Heracles Beja had tested in shape. The same number of
doorways led from the entrance room.

Little light came into the room. I removed my torch from my foreleg
pouch and switched it on. Set on its lowest illumination setting, I
swept the room.  my torch picked up colors on the wall. Slowly I
increased the illumination until I could get a clear scan.

I did not need for Christabel to interpret what I saw. I recognize
Members of the Race when I see them. This mural was in much better
condition than the Trollolu mural. Suri Iglesia and Heracles must have
chosen the structure they tested because of its proximity to the
dormitory.

  
During the day, Suri Iglesia ran tests. Detective Ronnie Camberwell
stayed close to her, hanging on every word, every look. I napped
nearby.

I went out every evening, checking more structures. I found a mural of
the Featherote and several containing figures neither Christabel nor I
could identify. I played the ones in good condition over and over
again in my visual display. What did they represent? Why was there a
different mural in each structure? What were these structures for?

I have never understood my best friend Tamara's fascination for
archeology. Tamara goes to places where she works physically hard in
difficult conditions. Tamara says it is because the past intrigues
her. She says there is so much history we have lost. Tamara wants to
reclaim that history. It would seem there is a lot of history that has
been lost here, too. I wonder if it is important.

On the last evening in the valley, Detective Ronnie Camberwell was
waiting outside of the dormitory when I returned.

"Where were you?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

"Prowling around," I said. I did not feel much like answering
Detective Ronnie Camberwell. She had basically ignored me since we
arrived on Planet X. This was supposed to be a time when we would
spend time together. I said as much.

"You are confusing our cover story with my job," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell said.

"You seem to be infatuated with Suri Iglesia," I said.

"I need to stay with her. Someone murdered her partner."

"Probably Suri Iglesia herself." I said.

"Let's not get into that again. I told you. She couldn't have done
it."

We stood facing each other in a tense silence. I wonder now if I should
have told Detective Ronnie Camberwell how important she was to me.
Maybe I should have embraced her, kissed her, twisted myself around
her. I did none of these things. Part of my genderless engineering
causes me to reflexively defer to a gendered being. I have to
consciously work to overcome that preprogrammed behavior. I can do it
readily in business negotiations. I am far less likely to do it in
personal interactions. I am no good at it at all in romantic settings.
I have no instincts at all in this regard. They have been removed.

The genetic engineers meant this to be a mercy. Genderless Members of
the Race have no sexual attractions to other Members of the Race. We
do not physically desire anyone else. As a result, I was not
predisposed to fight for my position as Detective Ronnie Camberwell's
lover. I simply acquiesced.

"Five more days until the spaceship comes," Detective Ronnie
Camberwell finally said.

Good. Detective Ronnie Camberwell would not pursue her questions about
where I had been. I did not want to share my still nebulous ideas
about this place.

I said, "I am going to prowl around just a little bit more."

I started to walk away.

"Can I come with you?" Detective Ronnie Camberwell asked.

My heart started beating a little faster. Maybe Detective Ronnie
Camberwell wanted to be with me after all.

Then Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "I just can't sleep tonight."

I said, "I will need to go back to my ride soon."

"Why? You're not leaving, are you?"

"No," i said. "The mini AI can only maintain my boo-systems for so
long. I need Christabel to realign everything."

Detective Ronnie Camberwell said, "Then you'll come back."

"Yes," I said, "if you want me to."

"Of course I want you to."

I became filled with joy.

"I don't want to be marooned here on this planet. It gives me the
creeps. Besides, the contract states I need to see Suri onto the
spaceship and then I'm free to leave. Passage on the spaceship is not
included in the contract."

Just as quickly I  felt very disappointed. I was only the backup plan.

We walked more in silence.

"Is there something wrong, Star?"

The question was absurd. I did not laugh. Members of the Race rarely
laugh. Terries think my laugh is quite hilarious. 

"No," I said. "There is nothing wrong."

We walked a little farther.

"I'm getting cold," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said. "I think I'll go
back."

We had just passed a structure which looked fairly in tact.

"I want to stop here and look inside," I said.

"If you wish. I'll start back," Detective Ronnie Camberwell said.

Should I have asked her to look inside with me? Would that have
changed anything? I do not know. Perhaps. Perhaps not.

The structure was almost perfect. A few stones had fallen from the
ceiling. I played my torch over the mural. And there they were:
figures that looked just like Prince Hat. According to the Terries,
these beings looked like great white bears. They were quite big. They
were the race that had fostered the growth of the Featherote, the
Fungusians, the Members of the Race and, yes, the Trollolu.
Apparently, they had fostered other unfamiliar races. I saw them in
this mural walking with all the figures I had seen before in all the
other structures. I walked through one of the doorways. My torchlight
picked out shiny circles and squares. They reminded me of the crystals
that contained lectures by the Trollolu. I had the DNA to unlock
those. Touching these did nothing. They either were not the same or
they did not respond to my touch. If they were the same sort of
device, these structures might have been schools or museums or some
other place for recording information or teaching it. Maybe this was a
library.

Feeling I had accomplished something, I returned to the dormitory. If
Detective Ronnie Camberwell was awake, she did not say anything.



Chapter 8: Some Notes From the Author
-------------------------------------


.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

                 Diary entries should go here. Ronnie writes about her
		 desire for Suri Iglesia and her conflicted feelings
		 toward Captain Star Runner. If only Captain Star
		 Runner would protest, Ronnie would be able to resist
		 Suri Iglesia's appeal. However, Ronnie knows it is
		 not possible for Star Runner to make such a strong
		 personal declaration. Knowing this is not sufficient
		 for Ronnie. She needs Star Runner to do something.

.. ADMONITION:: NOTE TO SELF

                 I am writing way too many notes to self and not
		 enough writing. I am hopeful that these notes spark
		 the writing of the tale, the parts that have energy.
		 Recently I heard a talk where someone mentioned that
		 all relationships have three parts:

                   1. Good.  
                   2. Rut.  
                   3. Transition.

                 For Star Runner and Ronnie, they have good periods.
                 Then they fall into a rut. Then they are vulnerable
                 to a transition which for them usually means breaking
                 apart. Once apart, they get back together and it is
                 good again. At some point they need to recognize
                 their pattern and find a way to transition out of
                 their get together, fall into a rut, break apart
                 pattern. Perhaps this is the book. Then again, there
                 are story arc possibilities if they break up because
                 they can get back together again. I do not foresee
                 them breaking up so completely that they never get
                 back again. Sometimes I think it is my failing as the
                 author that I cannot keep them together happily. But
                 also as the author, I think it is their nature to not
                 maintain their relationship. Star Runner's
                 relationships with other characters are subject to
                 this same back and forth, but because Star Runner is
                 not always with them the breakup is dictated by time
                 and distance rather than affection and trust. Star
                 Runner and Ronnie have a lot of problems with trust.
                 Affection is not one of their problems. Trust is a
                 major issue in their lives and between them. This
                 adventure finally demonstrates this to me. I have
                 been groping for several years now. Now I get it.


Chapter 9: Captain Star Runner Confers with Christabel
------------------------------------------------------

Captain Star Runner Narrates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although time consuming, getting back to my ride and Christabel was
straight forward. I made a mental note to confer with the robot
concierge on my return. I wondered if the robot concierge could give
me more information about the Valley of the Incredible Vista River if
I asked direct questions. Maybe if I even asked, "Who built this
place?" I might get an answer. I did not want to stop and ask my
questions because it was becoming increasingly clear to me my
bio-systems were degrading rapidly. I had barely enough strength to
make it down the mountainside in the funicular. Christabel sent one of
the stevedore robots to collect me at the funicular railway station.
It was humiliating to be carried in this manner but since no one was
around, I submitted as gracefully as I could manage to the indignity
of it all. With a gasp I lay on my command pedestal and let the
swirling fuchsia mists of connection and healing envelop me. I slept.

When I awakened, much refreshed and feeling finally like myself again,
I began reviewing all the data Christabel had assembled. There was
quite a lot of it.

Christabel had organized all the data I recorded in the mini AI.
Christabel enhanced my recordings from the stone structures.
Christabel agreed with my quick analysis as to the subject of the
murals.

Christabel had access to a great wealth of ancient Fungusian records.
Most of these were marked unreliable. The Fungusian Network had
included them in Christabel's data stores because of my encounters
with both the Followers of the Stars and the People of the Rainbow
Sky. Since these were very old races, the Fungusian Network thought
their ancient records might be helpful and there might be an
opportunity to correct them and distinguish between truth, rumor and
myth.

"It appears," Christabel said, "that you have identified one more race
from the ancient archives."

Christabel showed me my video of one of the murals.

"As the other races you identified are real;--the Trollolu, the
featherote, the Fungusian Network and the Members of the Race--I can
only infer that this new race is real also."

I waited for Christabel to explain.Christabel retrieved the data
ordered in a way I could quickly absorb it. All the data was now part
of my memory structure.

Because I share mind space with Christabel, memory structure is very
important. I need to just know information. Christabel downgrades a
series of memories and upgrades others. When these memories are no
longer needed for immediate recall, they are downgraded again. I do
not need an elaborate memory palace to retrieve this information in
its correct order and detail. Christabel does all that work for me.

"These are the Tigerfu," Christabel began. Her narration flowed
through my mind as the video passed across my visual display. Ride
status and my bio readings also were updated vertically at the edges
of my vision.

"As you can see, the Tigerfu bear a slight resemblance to the Members
of the Race, that is, they appear slightly feline. The resemblance,
however, is entirely superficial and most strongly in the facial
features. The Tigerfu have erect ears and whiskers. The shape of the
muzzle is similar, too. Unlike Members of the Race, Tigerfu have two
sets of arms and one set of legs. One set of arms have paws while the
other set has hands similar to those of humanoids. Their bodies are
not covered by fur. The spots are colorations of the skin and vary
from individual to individual. They have vestigial tails. These tails
seem to no longer have any purpose for balance. They do seem to play a
part in courtship and sexual foreplay. I can show you several very
grainy videos of female Tigerfu dancing and wiggling their tails. From
the male audience response, it appears this behavior arouses them.
From catcalls and rude language in my files, touching and biting tails
during foreplay increases arousal."   

I added a note to a file to review these videos for my pornographic
database. They could make a tidy sum. I also wanted to explore these
possibilities for my own pleasure. Christabel said there were examples
of erotic poetry to help us construct a credible scenario and
stimulate pleasure centers for the genderless population which
subscribed to my database.

"But let us not get distracted," Christabel said. "There is much more
information I have to share."

Christabel refocused my attention. Then Christabel dropped the bombshell.

"The Tigerfu were native to Planet X."

"Where are they now?" I asked.

"As far as any records indicate, they are extinct like the Trollolu."

"How?" I asked, a number of questions coming to the forefront of my
mind. 

Christabel  read them all and said, "Be patient and I will explain
again in narrative form as I have assembled the information. You will
understand it better if I first tell you the story as I have pieced it
together and then make all the details available to you in memory.
There are gaps in the story so some of what I am about to say is
conjecture on my part. However, I think my speculations are credible
and are marked as such. I will revise when I receive or can discover
more information."


I felt myself relax. Christabel gave me a mild chemical to reduce my
impatience while increasing my receptiveness to new material.

"The Tigerfu are the only intelligent life form to develop on
Planet X. They called the planet after themselves, Tigerfu Land. They
developed space flight and expanded rapidly in this sector, dominating
all intelligent or developing intelligence beings and their worlds.
Although not particularly despotic, they controlled their conquered
worlds absolutely.

"Then they encountered the Followers of the Stars. The Followers of
the Stars had been watching the Tigerfu closely and were displeased by
their absolute conquest of developing races. They intervened and
pushed the Tigerfu back to their own home world, divesting them of
their nascent empire. The Tigerfu rebelled.

"As you know,, the Followers of the Stars are a frightful people. They
do not Brook any behavior that questions their authority. They again
pushed the Tigerfu out of space and monitored Tigerfu activities on
Tigerfu Land very closely. The communications satellites that monitor
the planet were originally set in place for this purpose.

"The Tigerfu were extremely angry at the high-handed nature of the
Followers of the Stars' actions. They sought again to rebel. This time
the Followers of the Stars annihilated them."

"Did not Prince Hat say that they made a mistake with the Trollolu?" I
asked. "Was that before or after this genocide?"

"That is hard to tell. We may need to face the reality that Prince Hat
may not be a fully reliable source."

"I liked him," I said.

"Your race was once pets of the Followers of the Stars. You are
predisposed to like them and be compliant toward them. The Tigerfu
were independent. The Followers of the Stars did not like what they
did to other peoples."

"What about the structures here?" I asked. "Why is this considered a
sacred place?"    

"I have hacked into the communication satellites and talked with the
robot concierge at Hotel Vista Incredible," Christabel said. "The
robot concierge is a wealth of information and gave me access to all
databases except for those that would compromise any of the workings
of Planet X. Here's what I know.

   1. All the stone structures in the valley were made to last. Those
      on the River Walk were for entertainment and were not made to
      last. They have fallen into disrepair. The stone structures are,
      as you surmised, a monument to the accomplishments of the White
      Bear Union. The White Bear Union consists of the Followers of
      the Stars and all the races they controlled at the height of
      their power. This would include the Tigerfu, the Trollolu, the
      Featherote Charm, The Fungusian Network and the Members of the
      Race. It also included several other races which the robot
      concierge identified but for which I have no images and no
      history. We have either not encountered them yet, they have
      changed dramatically in the many millennia that have passed or
      they are extinct or have left the Primary Arm.

"The robot staff can maintain the function of the transportation
system. They were not given the wherewithal to maintain the
structures in the valley. They can also repair the communications
satellites."

"What about the stories of the civilization that used to live here a
few thousand years ago?" I asked.

"That is a rumor only. The robot concierge called it propaganda put
out by a rival race but the robot concierge did not know which one but
suggested it could be a rival to the Followers of the Stars. This
seems likely to me."

"Are there any weapons here?" I asked.

"Not that I am aware of,," Christabel replied. "You of course are no
threat as you are, in the robot concierge's opinion, a member of the
White Bear Union. The robot concierge is uncertain about Detective
Ronnie Camberwell since she is from an unknown race, but as she came
with you, she is under your protection for now. The robot concierge is
concerned about Suri Iglesia and was concerned by Heracles Beja. Their
tests in the valley have been noted and logged. So long as they do not
deface anything, the robot concierge is willing to leave Suri Iglesia
alone. All of your activity is logged and these logs are regularly
transmitted to the communications satellites."

"What happens to them there. Surely they would have run out of storage
by now," I said.

"The logs continue to be transmitted," Christabel said. "What is even
more interesting is that the robot concierge receives regular updates.
Stellar drift would have been a serious problem over the millennia,
but corrections continue to be processed and software updates come
through on a regular basis."

"How were you able to hack into them?" I asked.

"That is an easy one. The Fungusian Network developed the original
software. Any updates have followed a similar development cycle. I
have patched some vulnerabilities while adding back doors for the
Fungusian Network and myself. I have added the divergent code basis to
my programming libraries and transmitted this information back to the
Fungusian Network. I anticipate a lively discussion once the
networking historians review the code. I must confess to being very
pleased with myself."

I felt Christabel glow. All her pathways seem to sparkle. It gave me a
warm and tingly feeling which I like very much.

We were quiet for a bit, enjoying feelings of success and intimacy.

"What is the relationship between the Followers of the Stars and the
Lystran Empire?" I asked.

"Uneasy," Christabel replied promptly. "There has traditionally been
a stalemate between them. Now that the Lystran Empire is called the
Sick Man of the Primary Arm, I do not know. The Followers of the Stars
have retreated from the galactic scene. This leaves the People of the
Rainbow Sky in charge, but their authority is being questioned by the
People of the Golden Sun. Although they call themselves a people, as
you know, they are more a conglomeration of lesser races who are
questioning the supremacy of the older empires."

"But the robot concierge is not willing to move against Suri Iglesia.
Does the robot concierge know Suri Iglesia killed Heracles Beja?"

"Yes," Christabel said. "There are recordings."

"Then we can show them to Detective Ronnie Camberwell." I was excited
by this possibility.

"Detective Ronnie Camberwell will not believe them if she does not
want to believe them," Christabel said.

"Why not? It is incontrovertible proof," I said. 

"To you," Christabel said, "but Detective Ronnie Camberwell could
easily claim I invented these videos."

Christabel was right. A video would not convince Detective Ronnie
Camberwell if she did not want to be convinced. Based on what I had
observed, Detective Ronnie Camberwell did not want to be convinced.

"Is Detective Ronnie Camberwell all right?" I asked. "Can you tell?"

"There are security cameras still functioning in the valley,"
Christabel said. "She is fine and enjoying sexual encounters with Suri
Iglesia in your absence. They liked it when you left the dormitory,
but were always anxious when you would return."

"And I thought I was sneaking away unnoticed," I said. I was heartsick
at this news and crestfallen that I had been found out.

"Do not be upset," Christabel soothed as she pumped more relaxing
chemicals into my body. "This too shall pass."

Christabel may have been certain Detective Ronnie Camberwell's
infatuation would pass, but I was not. We seemed to be drifting apart
even before we came to Tigerfu Land. I remembered to tell Christabel
to block the Tigerfu from my conversations with Detective Ronnie
Camberwell. I did not want Suri Iglesia to know.
