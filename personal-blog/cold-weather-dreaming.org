I have bee working the last couple of days on Raspberry Pi projects.  I want to clean up that blog and publish it the same way I am publishing this one.  I have finally gotten a bluetooth keyboard working on the pi.  I am writing this post with it.  It means that after a busy day, I can sit on the couch and work while the pi sits on my standing desk.  It does take energy to work there.

All the while I have been thinking of my two series characters, Captain Star Runner, the Pantheran and Ronnie Camberwell.

When I write another adventure some time this year, they will be together on an alien space station.  I will be posting short pieces about their new port of call.  Perhaps there will be a short story as well.

Thinking about my characters always gets me thinking how what I have already written languishes on my hard drive and in the cloud.  I need to find a way of at least getting an acceptable draft of my book posted.  Working through the blog posts gives me some sense of what this project might look like.
