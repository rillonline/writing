THE ADVENTURES OF STAR RUNNER: The PANTHERAN: BOOK 1
* Chapter 1: A Strange Conversation

Today the Secretary General closed all Coalition borders. 

I have taken this unprecedented action,” the Secretary General said, "in order to keep the lawlessness that has invaded our Space. Although I know this will be a hardship for those who have family and business interests outside Coalition borders, I have been forced to institute these stringent measures because some elements have seen to prey upon Coalition 	citizens and Coalition interests, disregarding the rule of law and the Space Conventions. I have ordered Coalition fleets Alpha through Theta to coordinate patrol of jump points. Local authorities have been requested to patrol their own space. Failure to maintain closed borders will result in interdiction and immediate expulsion from the Coalition. Such unilateral decision-making flies in the face of our cherished heritage of cooperation; however, difficult times demand difficult decisions and resolve.

"I call on all members of the Coalition to hold firm against the forces of chaos and lawlessness to preserve our way of life and so that these matters can be dealt with quickly. When order has been restored, our borders will again be open for the healthy exchange of ideas and commerce we have formerly enjoyed with non-coalition worlds."

In a pig's eye," Granger said as the news commentators resumed their chatter over the bar's vidcaster. Kahannick has been itching to close the northern border for years. Now its got its chance."

"Yeah, Granger," a spacer at a nearby table said, "but here in the North things are getting very ugly. The Ursula is overdue and that makes the fifth ship this year and that's just here on this space station. We're hardly the crossroads of the Arm. I've heard it's like this all over."

"Maybe she got caught when the Border closed," another Spacer offered.

"Nah," the first said. "She was stopping at Ellison's World. That's beyond the border. She operates outside of Coalition space, well, usually. Garrison has no love for the Coalition."

Mutters of assent circled the bar. Captain Garrison's dissatisfaction with the Coalition was well-known on Dirty World Station. Ellison's World  was part of his regular route. The fact that Garrison and Ursula were overdue was unsettling. If anyone could withstand, outrun or outwit the pirates or rebels or whatever and whoever they were, it was Captain Garrison. Nevertheless, Ursula was overdue.

I held my glass between my paws. I had stopped sipping my brew some time before. I tried not to be scared. My ship was undergoing its final checks before launch. I would  be shipping out in less than a Terry  hour. I was heading right for the region of space where most of the disappearances were occurring. Added to this, Secretary General Kahlua an I had a lot in common--at least, the Terries and their kind would think so.

Kahlua was engineered to be part of the diplomatic corps. Me. I'm a star runner, designed to be what Terries call an astrogator. . we are both androgyns. To the Terry way of thinking, we are freaks. They look upon us with suspicion and usually give us a wide birth. 

So you may think it is strange that I would be drinking a Terry drink in a Terry bar on a Terry space station outside the borders of the Coalition. No one spoke to me. No one looked in my direction.

I looked at my glass again. What would a spacer do? Could I just shove the glass and its contents into the recycler? 
Would Granger find my behavior unacceptable? He had previously explained to me that I needed to order something to sit in his bar. I sat in his bar to hear spacer talk about the conditions around the northern frontier, markets, ships and whatever gossip that passed between Terry spacers. I had to listen to a lot of other talk, politics and a great deal of chatter that made little or no sense to me. 

The Terry spacers continued to talk among themselves. Apparently, they had forgotten I was in the bar or they did not care. I felt very much alone, a feeling which troubled me more and more the more time I spent among terries.

I finished my bubbly drink, shoved the glass into the recycler and extricated myself from the contraption Terries call a chair.

"Hey, Star," one of the spacer called over to me. "We don't mean you when we're talking about the cats. It's nothing personal between us and you. You know that, don't you?"

This concept of personal, or more properly put, what is personal is very Terry. The Race has a definite idea about personal, but insulting the Race is the same as insulting me. however, the spacers I have encountered here at the bar bear me no particular ill will. I think they have become used to my comings and goings. 

I replied, "I understand."

"Are you shipping out?"

I hesitated. The spacers had never before asked me a question like this. Should I tell them? If I did not tell them, they would not be able to sit here at Granger’s bar and wonder if I would be overdue. Maybe that was the point of the exercise. 

"In," I queried my ship in my head, "twenty-seven of your minutes."

"Where are you going?"

"A rendezvous outside the Sacred Worlds," I answered.

"Close to the border."

"Too close to the border," I growled.

"When do you expect to return?"

Again I hesitated. This question was also unexpected. I was being included in the concern for outbound spacers.

I queried my ship and responded with the Terry date.

"We'll be watching for you, Captain. Take care of yourself, Star."

"Thank you."

I padded out of the bar.

Terries think of The Race as large cats. As felines are not native to our home world, some of the nuances of their comparison are lost on me. As far as I have been able to observe, the similarities are very generic: we have fur, we growl and purr. Our ears are on the top of our heads and we can swivel them. We also have tails. For reasons lost in genetic history, star runners are blessed with very long and full tails which we use to great effect when making entrances or exits.

I stand over six feet tall at the shoulder. I am well-muscled, with fuchsia-colored fur. I have a splash of white fur on my forehead. The norm is to be pastel-colored with no contrasting fur. I have always considered my white patch unfortunate and an embarrassment. The Terries tell me it is in the shape of a star which I find confusing. However, Terries have found it amusing since I am a star runner. They call me Star Runner and for their convenience, I call my little ship that, too. The Race uses unique numbers for each of its androgyns and spacecraft which is much more efficient. I have also observed that shortening names is a sign of comradery among Terries. Being called Star rather than Star Runner might be significant. I would have to ponder all this on my way to my rendezvous near the Sacred Worlds. 
I made my way through the narrow corridors of the Dirty World Space Station to the wharf where my little ship was docked. I had chosen this particular space station s my home port because of its small size and lack of terries. 

At first, I had gone to a large Terry space station. The crowds, the noise, the smells were overwhelming. Terries stared at me. I found it difficult to negotiate the corridors with everyone pointing at me. I was attacked several times. The station management was slow to respond to my requests for cargo handling and ship maintenance. I was told at many establishments that they did not want me present.

I retreated to my little ship and brought a low priority cargo to Dirty World Station. The station manager was courteous. The shipyard recommended several repairs and performed them efficiently and at a reasonable cost. I received a better cargo bound for the Sacred Worlds. I found my niche in frontier shipping. I could deliver a small cargo more quickly than most Terries. I transport stolen goods and illegal goods--no questions asked. Sometimes an entity doing this sort of business is called a smuggler. Sometimes it is called a gun runner. Gunrunner appeals to me because I am a star runner. My transactions are confidential and quick. Dirty World Station serves me well as no one comes to the Dirty World Star System for pleasure. Serious spacers, often with questionable cargos, frequent the space station, no questions asked. Unlike some other ports on the Northern Frontier, the space station itself is reputable. They do not ask. We do not tell. 

* Chapter 3: Secret Procurement
  
I pick up. I deliver. The call that came in as I pondered my next move ratchetted my involvement in the movement of munitions up a notch.

"I have need," the caller said, "of some very specific items. Can you provide them?"


The source of the transmission was hidden, audio only.

"Perhaps," I said. "It's not my usual method of operation."

"Your method of operation is well known to us," the caller continued. "We have checked you out very carefully. You come to us highly recommended for your, say we shall, discretion."

"I do not handle procurements," I said. "I transport."

"But for a price--" the caller left the end of its sentence unfinished, hanging betwen us.

My move. I could cut the transmission off. I culd refuse outright. I could agree. I could ask more questions, try to get a trace on this call. The question that had started to plauge me here at Dirty World Station: Was I being watched? Was this call being monitored? Was this call coming from the Consortium to trap me?

"I work with contracts and advances," I said. "I do not act on speculation."

"That can be arranged."

"I also require references for new clients."

"You will have them."

In my perifferal vision, the Ship displayed the references.  They had been verified. The caller was unknown to me but not to some of my best clients. Ship had independently verified their recommendations.

"If a suitable contract can be arranged," I said. "I'll see what I can do."

"That will be agreeable," my caller said. "You have two weeks."

When Ship displayed the list of supplies and the proposed contract, my whiskers quivered. heavy armaments. A tight schedule. A location for delivery where I had never been. A very generous payment schedule even given my exorbident fees.

I cleared Ship to leave Dirty World Station promptly. We could work off station as well as on and my proximity to Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo concerned me. Besides, there were other people on station who had been on station just before I was disappeared. I didn't want that to happen again.		  Ship summarized LegalAdvisor's terms and condii\tions. My brain is not configured to understand LegalAdvisor very well. In my juvenile confidence, I had once entered LegalADvisor's databanks. I became hopelessly confused and would have gone into severe shock had I not been able to use my tahought safety line to find my way back. I never went in there again. Ship's summary allowed me to simply know the information without having to read it. This has proven a more satisfactory method for staying on top of my contracts, responsibilities and rights. Ship had already located 80% of the goods. As I thought about the ocntract, that percentage rose. Clearly, I hadn't been given hard things to find. A test then. The first shipments were to be easy. The contract had been so structured that I could deliver without finding and delivering everything. There were so nice-to-have-it-you-can-find-it items. I received a premiumif I could locate them, of course, ut I would not be penalized.

One of the quirky provisions of the contract was that I personally deliver the items by appearing on Pirate's Cove in the manager's office. The coordinates would be given in me when I had procured the required items. Well, so be it. I would be compensated.

We jumped when our procurement was at 97.79%.

* Chapter 4: Arrival at Pirate's Cove

Pirate's Cove was a station far from the border, on the ral frontier. I docked with 98.37% of the goods requested. I was quite pleased with myself. I was here in twenty-four days as the humans count time and eight of them had een used to get to Pirate's Cove.

The name of the station had been strange to me. I knew now abut pirates. The word cove meant some sort of harbor or chamber. Ship's further research had indicated the two words together had a pleasant sound  to a human's fanciful imagination, connoting adventure. I liked reading human's	 imaginative stories. The read a little like our great ballads of long ago hunters. I particularly liked them when they began "Once upon a time..."

We docked. The space way deployed.

This being a new station, I proceeded cautiously. I began by marking the airlock with fresh urine. Androgyns has no instinct for this. Males still do it ceremoniously. I have found my marking of my territory puts males and females on notice that is my ship. It makes me somehow more equal, a true hunter. I also have observed that it offends human sensibilities and keeps them away. The aroma is more offensive to them than informative.

It occurred to me as I marked, a very flamboyant and satisfying activity, that embodying the hunter so far out on the frontier culd e an asset. I would not be tame, civilized. I would be a being from the wild.

I there stepped onto the space way on all fours, glad to stretch from the long trip strapped into the acceleration web. When I cycled through the lock onto the station, the smell of human was thick in my nostrils. Yes, I was playing this right. Humans were much more at ease when their alien companions were more like them than different from them. 

I looked at the blinking map of the station on the wall, located the office of the station manager and padded quickly in its direction, scattering other station personnel as I went, being larger than they and moving quickly. It was physically challenging in the higher gravity, but the results were very satisfying. Again I cursed the genetic engineers for not giving androgyns the ability to roar.  "Welcome, Captain Star Runner," the woman behind the desk said as I entered her office. She had risen to greet me. Shaking hands with humans is a silly practice. I dispise it and they would find sniffing their anal glands offensive. Many normal practices of The Race offend humans. I sat on my haunches, eschewing a human chair.

"Arent's you the swashbuckler!" she said and moved in her in that way humans call smiling which can mean a number of different thingss. Was she deiriding me?

"I am unfamiliar with this word," I said. I have learned that faning ignorance and not reacting is often the most prudent course with humans. In fact, I did not know what a swashbuckler is.

"Someone who is very satisfied with himself," she said, "and doesn't mind showing it."

"I am not a him," I said. Although some androgyns prefer to be genderized by others, I do not.

"The swashbucklers of old," the woman explained, "were swordsmen and quite showy in their handywork. They were all men. You would be prefer to be referred to as it?"

"Yes."

"You've been quite successful in your procurements," she continued. "We're very pleased. When your shipment is inspected, we'll complete our transaction with you."

I said nothing. I waited. So far, my appearance in her office was unnecessary. I had also noticed she had not introduced herself.

"You may be wondering why I insisted you come here," she went on. "I wanted to meet you and for you to meet me and some of my associates and for you to understand what we are doing."

"Why? You are a long way off the star lanes and time spent here is money lost for me."

She held up her hand. "If yo will do it, there will be other items for you to procure. Think of this as a business strategy meeting, if you like. You will be compensated for your expertise.In exchange, we will wine and dine you. I'm told you are quite fond of human food."

My stomach rumbled, loud in the small office. The woman smiled.

"Go have someting to eat," she said, "and stretch your legs around the station while we unload your ship. Then meet here at," she looked at her watch, "4 p.m. local time. I'll introduce you to the others then."

"And you are," I said, irritated that I had to ask.

"Oh, my apologies, Catain Star Runner," she said, suddenly flustered. "As station manager, you get so used to everybody knowing who you are and not knowing them. I'm Prudence Wu."

"Very welll, Station Manager Prudence Wu," I said. "I will do as you ask," and I left her office.

I located the station cafe. It was named the Spyglass Cafe. I padded up to the counter. I sat down and reached my forepaws up to the counter. By her reaction, I realized the woman on the other side of the counter had never seen anyone of The Race. I was pleased. She would ever think of me 
when she thought of us. She looked nervously at my paws, claws out, the same fuchsia was my coat. I knew my pastel brothers and sisters would never measure up. I looked at her  directly with my glittering green eyes. I would not tell her that these were rare on my world.

"What would you like," she stammered.

"A meal," I said, "a meal for a hungry captain who has been out among the stars for nearly a month with only space rations."

"We have macaroni and cheese, meat loaf and vegetable for our soup," she said, naming the specials displayed behind her. 

"That will be fine," I said.

"Which?" she asked.

"Everything," I replied.

"And to drink? Some milk?"

"What is this milk?" I asked.

"Oh,  \um, it used to come from a cow. Cats like it. I thought ..." she trailed off.

"A children's drink? To strengthen the young?"

"Grown ups like it, too," she said, brightening. "It's good with cookies. We have oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip."

I was feeling magnanymous. I will have all that, too," i said.

She brought me my drink in a bowl. I was not expecting this. I thought a mug or a glass was preferred. I checked Ship's databanks. Ah! Cats were to drink milk from a saucer and she had given me a larger portion.

"is everything all right?" she asked anxiously.

"Yes. I prefer my drinks in a bowl. Thank you." She watched as I daintily drank. It is so much more civilized to drink this way.
"This is like whipped cream," i said, but not as thick."

"Whipped cream is made from milk, well cream, which is the fat from milk," she said quickly.

I drank some more. Whipped cream had no ill effects. This milk was quite pleasant though Ship advised me that humans should not give milk to their adult pets.

"The cheese is made from milk, too," the woman said, pleased to aprize me of information I did not know.

"This milk is very versatile," I said.

She was right. The cookies tasted wonderful with the milk. I drank a great quantity of it.

Before I left the Spyglass Cafe  for my meeting with Station Manager Prudence Wu and her associates, I said, "Humans use names. What is yours?"

"I'm Tamara."

"Humans call me Captain Star Runner," I said.

"Pleased to meet you, Captain Star Runner," Tamara said. 

* Chapter 5: The Proposal

When I returned to Station Manager Prudence Wu's office, I found several other humans and a squat being who looked something like a mushroom and smelled like one, too. The other humans were men. We were introduced. The mushroom being was introduced to me as Funji Man.

"Though that's not his real name," Station Manager Prudence Wu hastened to inform me. "We can't pronounce his real name."

Something touched my mind, extening feelers. I put up mental stop signs. I am not telepathic. I can block telepaths on my own some. I rely more on Ship's advanced techniques. The feelers retracted. As humans are not telepathicI assumed the mushroom being Funji Man was the source of the probe. If a telepath makes contact with me, I can communicate. I cannot send except to be in contact with Ship. The genetic engineers did not want us to be able to communicate with other androgyns, leaving the males and females out of the loop.They thought this could be very dangerous.

"Why are you probing me?" I asked Funji Man.

"Probing you?" Hanson, one of the male humans, asked.

"Telepathically," I said.

The humans shifted thier positions, looking at each other.

"You did not know this one is a telepath?" I asked.

"Yes," Colonel Drucker replied. "We just can't tell."

"I have never made contact with a Pantheran," Funji Man finally said. "I wondered what it might be like."

"I do not like mind invasions," I said. "Stay out."

"Of course."

The humans again exchanged glances and did a lot with their feet.

"Well, Captain Star Runner, we called this meeting to float a proposal," the one called Zelbouski said.

I looked about the room. No water. How did one float a proposal.

Make. The thought was at the edge of my consciousness, hovering just at my mental border. The telepath.

"I'm listening," I said out loud. "Do you want me to procure some more hardware for you."

"yes, in a manner of speaking. We are putting together a task force to capture a Pantheran ship. We want you to help us."

Iwas stunned. I am a gunrunner, a smuggler, but I do not capture ships. I told this to Zelbouski.

"But you are not opposed to doing so in principle?" Station Manager Prudence Wu asked.

"I am not, how do ou say it, a bandit," I said."I buy and sell and transport."

"That is where you come in," Colonel Drucker said. "We need someone to fly the ship."

I was silent, thinking. Of course. The humans and the one they call Funji Man could not pilot one of our ships. They would need a runner for that.

"So you want to hire me to pilot a ship? Where is this ship and where do you want it to go"

"We don't have the ship," Hanson said. "We need to capture one of the patrols at the border and bring it here."

"This would be a military action, your forces engaging the patrol," I said.

"Yes."

They began showing me plans, pictures, diagrams. As their plan took shape, it became clear to me that it would be necessary to cross the closed border into Coalition space and that their plan could not work unless they had a runner.

As I began to understand the plan, I felt my hair stand up on end and my tail puff way up.

"You are afraid of this plan," Funji Man said. "Why?"

"If you had the ship," I said, "for a price I would pilot it from one place to another here on the frontier. It would be ... complicated to do this. But I will not engage in the capture."

"Because you are one of them?" Station Manager Prudence Wu asked. "We were under the impression runners working outside of the Coalition military would be willing to pilot our ship."

"Runners do pilot The Race's ships for others," I said. "however, you are not speaking of piloting one of your ships. You are speaking of capturing a ship. This is dangerous for two reasons."

"We're listening," Zelbouski said.

"1. Each military vessel is customized for its runner. There are codes, protections, personal routines built into the system. It is dangerous to connect my mind to a ship designed for someone else. It could hurt me."

"Fry your brain," Colonel Drucker said.

I hesitated. "Destroy your synaptic pathways," Funji Man said.

"Yes. This is especially true of a ship partcipating in a military action. It would be guarding itself."

"And you said there was another danger," Station Manager Prudence Wu said.

"Yes. If I were caught, I would be terminated."

"I am not prying," Funji Man said. "Images are spilling out of you. Your termination would be instant, irrevocable and nonnegotiable."

"Correct."

The room was silent.

"For the right price, I will pilot your ship," I said. "I will not cross the border to retrieve it." Then I left the room.

* Chapter 6

When I returned to the Ship, Ship ordered me to strap into my acceleration web.

"You are very upset," Ship informed me. "You need to have these toxens purged."

I strapped in.

Unbeknownst to me, Ship had been able to use the serveillance eqipment to tap into Funji Man's brain and to record the session. As a result, I could find out what was happening int the office while aboard the ship. I wondered how long it would be before Funji Man figured this out. Ship thought it would be a long time and that Funji Man might be unable to stop my evesdropping.

"You were right, Funji Man," Hanson said after I left. "You said it wouldn't go for the plan."

"Captain Star Runner has a reputation for taking risks," Funji Man said. "However, the risk is calculated. Profit is it's motive. It neither seeks revenge against the Coalition military nor wishes to involve itself in abstgract causes. Androgynous Pantherans are products of their creators. They are individuals but only to a point. They are motivated by self-interest and survival."

"Its fear seemed great," Station Manager Prudence Wu stated, "much greater than I had expected."

"You have to understand the Pantheran way. When a runner is no longer needed or no longer can fullfill its purpose, it is declared serplus and terminated. There is no appeals process. It is just done. Clearly, Captain Star Runner has been decclared serplus. If it were to fall into Pantheran hands, death would be quick. I think the good captain's reluctance is understandable."

"But we need him to pilot the ship," Colonel Drucker said. "We have no alternative unless you can make sense of it, Funji Man."

"i AM A telepath," Funji Man said.   "I can read the thoughts of many races but I cannot interface with machines. You need a runner to interface with a Pantheran ship."

As Ship extracted chemicals from my bloodstream, I became more able to think. Who were these people? Why did they want a Pantheran warship? I put Ship to work on this. We had little data. I was far out on the frontier and information was scarce. I lay in my acceleration web, still anxious and with very little to go on. I also didn't have another cargo. I wondered if I should simply leave Pirate's Cove and get back to a more central location. That, however, meant crossing paths with the Consortium and Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo and the possibility of bad coordinates. Doing business here on the frontier was becoming very complicated. My business plan was being impacted by forces and plans I did not understand. Funji Man was right. I had not been designed to figure all this out. I relied on my superior intelect and my acquisition of sophisticated software in the form of my Ship Mind to overcome my genetically engineered limitations.

"Do you have an alternative to capture the ship?" Hanson was asking.

"We need the ship over the border," Colonel Drucker said. "Can we develop a way to get it to come to us? Then perhaps this runner would be willing to work with us."

"We also need some big insentives," Station Manager Prudence Wu said. "We don't have the financial resources Captain Star Runner would like."

I perked up my ears at this. They were scheming. A scheme needed to be met with a scheme. What could I get out of the deal if we could come to an understanding. I began reviewing Pantheran ship design. In looking at schematics, I began to wonder why the Free Residents of the Northern Territories wanted a warship in the first place. Maybe motive needed to be a part of my negotiations from now on.

The meeting broke up. Funji Man returned to his ship and buried himself in his nutrative bed which basically looked like a box of dirt. The telepathic link was broken.While I slept, Ship worked. Pedestrian cargos were bookedd that would bring us closer to the border where more lucrative contracts could be had. Updates on the Consortium, the disappearances and the Free Residents of the Northern Territorieswere logged. 

No explanations were forthcoming about the disappearances except that they were continuing. Many independent freighters had been lost with their experienced captains.  Although it hadn't happened yet, there would be a crunch, it becoming more expensive to transport goods than the good were worth. Already munitions were becoming very, very expensive. Ship had some good contracts when I got us closer to the border. Soon, however, I could be running ordinary goods as the interdiction dragged on. The one thing I wouldn't do is go into coalition space. When I had become a smuggler, I had turned my back on any possibility of going back. I was considered a lawbreaker though in truth I hadn't broken any laws except transporting goods that might be stolen.

As for the Consortium, their inquiries were ongoing. They were in negotiations with the Coalition for special rights to get goods across the border in both directions. No word on Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo though.

The Free Residents of the Northern Territoriesappeared to be a loosely organized group of individuals and worlds with small populations. These people wanted to be basically left alone and unregulated. Ship was still working on their sources of funding.

I enjoyed my time at Pirate's Cove, eating and getting to know a different group of spacers. Like Dirty World Station, this station asked few questions about its clientell and as a result, the 
seamier side of the frontier passed through. Small groups of settlers passed through, too, indivduals, family groups. Nothing too organized. There were no slick salespeople, noslick presentations. Just people making a fresh start. Maybe they were running from the law. Maybe they were in financial or personal difficulties. Maybe they just needed to start over again. I could relate to that.

"Before you go," Station Manager Prudence Wu was quick walking beside me. "a word with you, Captain Star Runner."

I stopped.

"Yes."

"My office."

"Very well."

I dropped to my haunches in Station Manager Prudence Wu's  office. Station Manager Prudence Wu  was alone. Station Manager Prudence Wu  shut the door and turned on the bug sweepers.

"FRONT," Station Manager Prudence Wu  said, "is still interested in procurement."

"Do you have a list?"

"Yes."

"I hope you don't have a Pantheran warship on your list," I said.

"In fact we do," Station Manager Prudence Wu said, smiling, "but it's not on the list I have for you."

"TRansfer it to my ship."

The order was transmitted, reviewed and the contract terms returned. Station Manager Prudence Wu scanned it as I waited. "This is fair albeit expensive," she said. 

"You want expensive, scarce things," I said.

"You've never asked why," Station Manager Prudence Wu  said.

"It's of no concern to me," I said.

"You like your independence," Station Manager Prudence Wu  said.

"Independence is necessary," I said.

"Necessary? How is it necessary?"

"When I was part of the Institute," I said, "I worked as a well-trained member of my home world. Now that I am not a part of that world, I work independently, for my own interests. No one else has my interests at heart."

"That's a very cold assessment," Station Manager Prudence Wu observed.

"It is truthful," I said.

"You have no friends?"

"No. There is only self interest."

There was a pause. Station Manager Prudence Wu fiddled with some objects on her desk.

"We had hoped you might be interested in throwing in lot with us, FRONTStation Manager Prudence Wu said. "That would require loyalty to the group and having a commitment to more than profit for yourself. But I'm wondering if that is possible given what you have told me. Captain Star Runner, does any of this have to do with you being a runner?"

Her proposal surprised me. I didn't think humans woulod want to depend on an androgyn and Ididn't know what I thought about depending on them. I was used to working alone and only doing what I thought involved a manageable risk.

"Runners are designed to integrate with their ships," I said. "The Ship becomes a part of us, extra sensory input, data, capabilities. Our ships also care for us physically, mentally, emotionally. We wouldn't feel fully ourselves without having a Ship in our minds. We would suffer physical and mental degradation over time. We need to be maintained. Because we do not mate, our Ship is our friend and our lover. Therefore other associations with others of our kind if neither encouraged or sought."

"You've told me quite a bit," STation Manager Prudence Wu said. "Most P:antherans are not this forthcoing about their society."

"Humans value the right of self determination," I said. "As a genetically engineered person, I lack much of what you humans consider essential for that."

"I see.l"

"Station manager Prudence Wu, now that I have given you much information,, I would like some information from you. Why do you want this warship? You could never pilot it."

"You ask fair questions, Claptain Star Runner. We want the ship for its data banks. We would like to think we could retrofit it to fly it ourselves."

"No," I said. "You will always need a runner."

"Would we need a runner to access its databases?"

I thought about this. 

"Routines could be written for your access portsk," I said. "You would need a runner to direct the data on the ship side and a human on your end to connect you into the data."

"Is this something you can do?"

I swelled up. "I am very capable," I said. 

"If we brought the ship across the border, could you bring it here and do the work?"

"In time," I said. "I could no operate a warship by myself."

"Could we help you?"

"Perhaps. I will need more information before I can commit to such a project."

"What do you need?"

"Which ship?"

"The specific ship?"

"The class."

"I don't have that information yet," Station Manager Prudence Wu said. "You will return to Prirates' Cove in two months. When you do, we will talk again."

"very well."

* Chapter 7

My procurement trip went well and I returned to Pirate's Cove. Since my inbound trips were becoing so lucrative, I became less worried about securing outbound cargos. I hoped this time I could do a quick turn around at the station since Ship needed few repairs. My servaillance and risk taking model were proving to be incredible assets. While other freighters disappeared, I was moving in and out of the what the humans had begun calling the Bermuta Triangle though how they could call any region of space a triangle mistified me.

I was siting in he Spyglass Cafe , drinking a large bowl of milk, when Colonel Drucker saw me and came over to my table.

"Going native?" he asked.

"An odd thing to say to an engineered being," I replied. 

"I know you are capable of drinking from a glass," he said.

"Tamara has always served my milk in a bowl," I said.

"Ah, yes, Tamara." He lowered his voice. "Quite a moonstruck girl."

I searched Ship's dictionaries quickly. 

"She does not seem to be impaired," I answered.

"But she is quite taken with you."

"I am not a sexual being."

"You know that. I know that. At some level she knows that, but--" he shook his shoulders. "Human women find you, attractive, probably because they can't have you."

"You wish me to tell them?" I asked. "You would like to have sex with them?"

Colonel Drucker's face got red. "Captain Star Runner, you have a way with words. I deserved this, but no, say nothing."

"Very well," I said, still unclear about human sexual rituals.

Colonel Drucker cleared his throat. "I'm actually here to invite you to a meeting with Funji Man. We're still figuring how to get that warship."

"My expertise does not come free," I said.

"Tere'lll be somethingin for you, do't worry, old friend."

I am neither old nor a friend of Colonel Drucker, however, I am learning humans use terms like this to encourage comradery. It would not change my requirement for payment.

We were in one of the station's conference rooms, supposedly bug free, neutral territory for discussions between parties. The room was crowded. The was the obligatory conference table, video screens, keyboard grids, refreshment machines. A bowl of water was at my place, a viewscreen and a microphone. I patched Ship in so that I could query the data unheard. The angle of the screen kept the output private.

"You've been providing us with excellent hardware, Captain Star Runner," Colonel Drucker said. "It's top-of-the-line and you deliver it promptly. We have had financial resources for these procurements, however, this project will necessitate a different payment schedule. Thisis a speculative mission. You will receive resources from the ship if we are able to secure it."

"What sort of resources?" I asked. I have learned not to say no immediately though of all this sounded like I would be stiffed.

"I would think a Pantheran warship would have hardware and software you could use," Colonel Drucker said. "We would give you a percentage and you could choose."

"You will not keep the ship in tact then" I said.

"We can't fly it in tact," Colonel Drucker said. "We know we cna't afford to hire you to do that. We're not looking for mercinaries. So, we're thinking there are parts and software will will need to replace and you might be able to use."

"How can you assess the whole?" I asked.

"We have figures from your government," Colonel Drucker said. "We'll give you 17% of their value."

Ship and I conferred.

"It's a dangerous mission," I said. "I will accept your offer but I will not go within 5 parsecs of the border.

Colonel Drucker whistled.


"You really are spooked," he said.

"I would be terminated instintly if caught," I said. "No questions. No trial. No randsome. No reprieve."

"Is there a way to get the vessel that far across the border without a runner?" Funji Man asked.

"Yes," I said. "I will give you that information when we have a proposal."

"So we have to trust you," Colonel Drucker said.

"Have I given you reason not to trust me?" I asked. "Besides, it makes sense that the crew of a warship would have some recourse if they would lose their runner in battle."

"So there is a work around," Colonel Drucker said.

"The relationship of runner to Ship is personalized. The farther you go, the more the Ship will balk at someone else's direction. The AI has some sort of symbiotic relationship to its runner. Every crew strives for a very seamless relationship so that Ship and Runner are virtually the same individual. When the Runner is removed, the Ship is, how would you say it, compromised, lonely, sad. Add to this that those who removed its runner are now in possession of the Ship..."

"I see," Colonel Drucker said, rubbing his chin.

"So we would be asking you to integrate with a separate and unique AI."

"Yes. And quickly while maintaining contact with my own Ship."

"With your own ship?" 

"My Ship knows my needs," I said. "I will need Ship to establish a working relationship with the warship. Ship can reassure the AI, share ifnormation specific to my needs, my operating parameters."

"this makes sense, Drucker," Funji Man said. "Runners are genetically engineered to use thought waves, to send and receive. They are as unique as human fingerprints. Add to that personality and biochemistry and a whole set of experiences, each matchup must be unique. We'll be asking oth Captain Star Runner and the AI to work together under high stress and with no trust established."

"Trust?" Colonel Drucker asked. "The computer has to trust?"

lots of failsafes built in. The captain will also be exposed to any traps the Ai and its runner have installed to foil a hostile takeover."

Colonel Drucker whiped sweat off his face with a handkerchief.

"This is more complicated than we had anticipated," he said.

"Raise the anty and I'm sure Captain Star Runner will risk it," Funji Man said.

"I'll have to talk with the others," Colonel Drucker said. "This is all new information.

When he had left the room, Funji Man turned to me and said, "Well done, Runner. These humans are brash. The Race has been around for a long time. Their engineering is far above what any human ship has on board. That is why FRONT wants a Pantheran ship."

"What is your interest?" I asked the fungusian.

"My race is also older. We have taken a different path than yours, choosing telepathy rather than genetically engineered individuals. I will be working with you to provide human interfaces. We can communicate after a fashion. I'll have your back when you go into the AI and I'll be able to talk with the humans to describe what's happening. You'll be too busy."

"Indeed," I said.

* Chapter 8

While the humans planned and Funji Man and I advised from time to time, my cargo runs continued. I did not stray far from Pirate's Cove. so my cargos were marginal. I was docking at the station without charge so, although my profit was minimal, my expenses were also minimal. Ship was in good repair.

I was walking along the corridor the humans called Main Street. This is where the Spyglass Cafe  and the shops were located. I rarely went into the shops. Most of the goods are for humans. I have few needs beyond a smooth-running ship and sufficient calories. The shopkeepers had become acustomed to my window shopping. A favorite store of mine sold jewelry and delicate clothing. I liked the sparkles from the jewelry and the pretty colors of the materials.

Colonel Drucker stopped by my shoulder.

"What're you looking at?"

"The pretty things," I said.

"Buying something for a special someone?"

"No. I just like pretty things," I said. "I've been wondering if the material is too delicate for me to handle."

"Well, I don't think the leingerie would work for you," Drucker said.

"But those long pieces of diaphanous material would be--" the right explanation illuded me. I thought about rubbing my face against the pretty pieces. I sighed.

Colonel Drucker touched my shoulder. His meaty hand sunk into my fur. Usually I would have shaken any contact off, moved to create space between myself and another being, especially a human being.  However, Colonel Drucker was giving off pheromones that signaled sexual desire. My curiosity wasw aroused. I wanted to see what would happen.

"Why don't we go in and see how you look in something sexy," Colonel Drucker said.

The store was crowded. Space on a station is expensive. I stood up to make moving inside the store easier.

"May I help you?" the saleswoman asked.

"My friend here," Colonel Drucker put his arm across my shoulders, "is interested in some of your scarves."

"Any one in particular?" the saleswoman asked.

"You liked that gold one, didn't you?" Colonel Drucker asked.

"Yes," I said, not sure what to make of Colonel Drucker's behavior.

"Let me get it for youk," the saleswoman said quickly.

She returned with several pieces of material of different colors and textures.

"With your coloring," the saleswoman said to me, "we need to be careful that a scarf enhances your look and doesn't clash with it."

She draped one of the scarves around my neck. She stepped back, looking me over. I didn't like being stared at. Normally,  I wouldhave tried to stare her down, but it seemed to be part of her job. Since The Race doesn't wear clothing like the humans do, this matching fur color to cloth color was a great mystery to me. I supposed if I lived in the household of a rich member of The Race, i would know more. Some of the males and females were inclined to have cloth accessories.

"Let me try another one," the saleswoman said.

After several different pieces of cloth and much arranging, she finally picked out one and asked me if I liked it.

"The blue  matches your eyes," she said. "I think I have a scarf ring that will go very well with this particular scarf, too. Would you like to see it?"

"Yes," Colonel Drucker said before I could answer.

The saleswoman went and opened a display case, returning with a small ring with blue stones. She slipped the ends of the scarf through it, tightening it around my neck. I shifted uneasily.

"This will help keep it on," she assured me. "Come over here where you can look in the mirror."

I looked. What I saw was a member of The Race with a human scarf around its neck. I had no way to judge whether I looked ridiculous or not. I was able to determine the blue colors were similar though hardly matching. I touched the material with a forepaw. Very soft. I could't wait to bring the material back to the Ship and rub my face against it.


Colonel Drucker slid his fingers across the back of neck, letting his hand brush my fur on my shoulders.

"Very pretty," he said. 

I realized they were both waiting for me to say something. What did one say?

"It's," I began, "I've never tried on anything like this before."

"Gems are defintely you," the saleswoman assured me. "Shall I wrap this for you?"

Before I could parse her peculiar illusions, Colonel Drucker said, "Just ring it up," he said.  Put it on my account." And to me he said, "This calls for a celebration, Star. Dinner at Alfredo's."

Mutely, I walked out of the store with all the pretty things and went to the restaurant. ColonelDrucker tucked my paw in the crook of his arm against his body. I had seen human males do with  human females as well as human males with males and human females with females. In all cases, the couple were lovers.

This wasn't what I had planned, but I was intreagued. Colonel Drucker continued to signal me chemically. He seemed unaware that I was not returning his signals, but then again, humans have such a poor sense of smell. Maybe he couldn't tell.

The restaurant was very different from the Spyglass Cafe . First of all, it was dark. There were candles on small tables covered with cloth. Colonel Drucker asked for a table for two in the corner. A uniformed employee led us there. Colonel Drucker pulled out a chair and told me to sit, touching my tail and trying to arrange it for me. All this touching made me shiver. When Colonel Drucker saw this, he smiled.

"And I though you were a reserved one," he said conspiritorially.

I queried Ship's databases. Apparently, all this attention, the gift of the scarf, now the meal in this overly dark restaurant was a precursor to sex. Or at least, was a human males attempt to convince the female to mate with him. I wondered what would happen when we got to that part. But again, I had no pressing business and my curiosity was peeked.

"Something to drink?" The waiter had come to our table.

"Scotch and water," Colonel Drucker said.

"And for the lady," the waiter said.

"What'll it be, Star?" Colonel Drucker asked me.

"Do you have milk?" I asked.

"Milk?" the waiter asked.

Had I said something wrong?

"Milk," Colonel Drucker said authoritatively. "She would prefer a bowl."

"Yes, Colonel," the waiter said and left quickly.

Colonel Drucker looked ater him and scowled. "What ever happened to service?" he asked rhetorically.

The waiter returned quickly with Colonel Drucker's drink and a platter of raw food stuffs. "I'll bring the milk right out. We're chilling the bowl," he said.

I watched Colonel Drucker take a long drink of out of his glass. Then he dipped one of the vegetables in some sauce and crunched it.

"This is good,m" he told me. He picked up another strip, dipped it and offered it to me. I hesitated.

"Open up," he said.

Again, I hesitated.

"Your moth," he said.

I did. He dropped the food inside. I tasted, crunched, swallowed. Odd. Colonel Drucker dipped a different strip. Again he offered it to me. Again I opened my mouth and he dropped it in. A peculiar ritual. I was more kitten than peir.  

My milk arrived. I picked the bowl up with my paws. Sitting in the chair, I couldn't lean over to drink. I brought the bowl to my moth, lapped carefully, then returned the bowl to the table. Some milk clung to my whiskers. I raised a paw to my face, prepared to wash, when Colonel Drucker leaned across the table and licked my mouth. This was too much. Feeding me wasw one thing. Washing me was another.

I was about to object when Ship signaled me to stop. Another search of the databases had revealed that Colonel Drucker's behavior was consistent with mating rituals. I could participate in the feeding and waswhing, too. Ship gave me the necessary instructions.


Datapads with food selections arrived along with another drink for Colonel Drucker.

"Order anything you like," Colonel Drucker said.

"You are continuing to purchase items?" I inquired.

"You're my date," he said. "I don't believe in going dutch."

I was grateful I had Ship to advise me.

"Thank you," I said and read over the menu. The dishes had all sortsw of names to act as a cypher for what they contained. All of them were consistent with the decor of being a restaurant on Pirate's Cove. I chose a sampler which reported to be seafood though no ocean was within several hundred thousand kilometers of the space station. Colonel Drucker's amorous behavior and Ship's research had givenme an idea. I would play up my similarity, in human eyes, to a cat.

And, surprisingly, the fish tasted very good. The Colonel ate red meat and with gusto, having several more drinks. I wondered how much alcohol he could withwstand.

From time to time during the meal, I leaned across the table and licked Colonel Drucker's mouth, chin and fingers, removing sauces and fats. He was very surprised at first, but as I took his hands, one by one, firmly in my paw and vigorously washed them as our plates were removed, he giggled.

"Hey, Star, that tickles."

"What tickles?" i asked as I turned his hand over.

"Licking between my fingers."

"Would you like me to desist, Colonel Drucker?" I asked.

"No," he said. "And it's not Colonel Drucker, Star, it's Philip."

Colonel Philip drucker wished to be informal with me. We were progresing with the mating ritual.

When I was finished washing Colonel Drucker's, Philip's hands, I began washing my own face and paws.

"Isn't having all that fur in your mouth a little much?" Philip Drucker asked.

"How else does one wash?" I asked innocently.

"With soap and water, in the shower," Philip Drucker said.

I shivered.

"You don't like water, do you?"

"I enjoyed playing in water when I was a kitten," I said."

"No kidding," Philip Drucker said. "You know how to swim?"

"Of course," I said. "It is part of survival training. We were also allowed to play games to develop confidence."

"We?"

"The other kittens in school," I said. "Human children attend school also?"

"Yes, of course," Philip Drucker said. "I guess I don't think of you as having been a little kitten, going to school."

"We were all juveniles once," I said. "Then we mature, age, die. This is the cycle of life."

"Yeah, but right now I'd rather focus on living."

"Very well," I said.

"Dessert?" he said. "You like whipped cream, don't you?"

"You seem to know a lot about me," I said.

"I've been keeping my eye on you," Philip Drucker said, and smiled again. This watching must also be a part of the ritual and was not about serveillancce for our planned capture of the warwship.

The whipped cream came on top of something called buttersscotch pudding. IT was very tasty. Philip Drucker asked if he could have a spoonful. Instead, I scooped up a blob of it with my tongue and put it in his mouth. His pheromone level increased when I did this so I did it again.level increased when I did this so I did it again. 

"You present some possibilities I hadn't considered," Philip Drucker said to me.

"Why use a spoon when a tongue will do," I said. I was beginning to understand how to play this 
mating ritual thogh I was not physically equipped to consumate the act. I knew from the pornography I had watched while Ship brought me to orgasm that I could bring a gendered member of The Race  to orgasm Ship confirmed that I could also bring a human to orgasm using similar techniques.

We left the restaurant paw in hand. Philip Drucker's behavior indicated both sexual arousal and that he was under the influence of mood altering chemicals. The Colonel Drucker I knew from our meetings was reserved. The man I was with kept touching me, laughing and placing his lips on mine, his tongue in my mouth though no wasing was now necessary. I copied his behavior.

We walked together, stopping for kisses, oward away from Main Street. We were, I decided, in search of a place to copulate. Humans were very private about this. My suspicions were confirmed when Philip Drucker thumbed open a door on a side corridor, announcing, "Ever it be so humble, there's no place like home."

The quarters were spacious as living space on a space station goes. He had a combo, that is, an office plus living space. It gave the air of size while keeping the price manageable. There was a living space with office, a bar, sanitation, kitchenette and sleeping area.

"Make yourself comfotable,"Philip Drucker said. "I'm off to the facilitiesw."

For the firswt time since the shop, I was alone. I pressed some of the material of my scarf across my cheeks and nose, inhaing. It felt wonderfully soft and smelled of the shop, the saleswoman, Philip Drucker and the restaurant. In time, I knew, it would smell of me and of my sleeping basket, a particularly satisfying place. 

Philip Drucker returned. His tie was off, his shirt open. He was barefoot. He watched as I straightened my scarf.

"You like feeling things with your whiskers, don't you,"

"Yes," I said. "I also like the way this feels against my face. Thank you for buying it for me." Though, I thought, I am able to buy it for myself.

"You're very welcome," Philip Drucker said, sitting on the couch next to me.

He ran his hands over the scarf and when he got them behind my neck, he leaned over me, pressing his cheek against the back of my head

"You are so soft," he whispered. "Can you sit on the couch with me?"

"Come sit here on the floor," I said.

He did, rubbing his face against my shoulder, stroking my spink with his hand. I began to pur.

"Star?"

"Yes."

"Are you purring?"

"Yes."

He sighed.



He continued touching me, stroking my spine, scratching my ears. I continued to pur. Then I reached a paw out, careful to retrack my claws and began touching him, trying to find the places on his body that would arouse him. His clothes were an impediment. I stopped to struggle with the buttons of his shirt.

"Allow me," he said.

I traced his musclulature, bicepts, tripcepts, pectorals. I judicoously used my claws to riffle through his chest hair. I began to lick him, wondering if little nips would give him pain or pleasure.

He carefully removed my scarf.

"We don't want to ruin this," he said. "How about we use the bed. The floor is a little hard."

He led the way. I padded behind him on all fours, watching as he removed the rest of his clothes. Human males do not have barbed penises. His was erect. He patted the bed next to him after he sat down.

"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty."

I bounded onto it, making a great flourish with my tail. he caught it, stroking it, putting the tip in hismouth and biting down, not hard. I patted him onto his back, again, not hard, dislodging my tail. I jumped down, went to the hallway, and stalked him, pouncing onto the bed over him, my tongue licking him all the way from his abdomen to his mouth. He wrapped his arms around my neck, pulling the upper part of my chest onto to his, kissing me. I riggled against him. He began to move against me. I reached my paw between his legs, stroking the inside of his thighs, holding hisscrotum in my paw. 

"On you," Philip Drucker said.

I kissed him, sticking my tongue into his mouth, changing our positions on the bed, rubbing my fingers up and dowwn his penis. I began kissing his chin, his collar bone, his chest, working my way toward his erection. He anticipated my direction, rocking. I covered him with my mouth, the tip of my tongue locating his sweet spot. He let me experiment, finding the right amount of pressure to apply. After his orgasm, I washed his pubic area throughly.

"Now Star," he said, curlingintomy chest. "What about you?"

"I'm an androgyn," I said. "I haveno sexuality."

"No pleasure?"

"In my head," i said.

"How can I--"  "Stroke me," I said.

When I was purring, Ship began stimulating my brain. It was different without the hormones being fed into my body, but Philip Drucker caressed me all over, soemtimes stroking and at other times scratching me--my ears, at the base of my tail, my breastbone. I kneaded him with my paws, careful to retrack my claws. After my orgasm, I folded him into my chest and curled myself around him. We slept.

* Chapter 9

The humans had various reactions to Philip Drucker and I having sex with each other. Well, that's not exactly accurate. They assumed we were having sex. I'm sure Philip Drucker didn't say much about it to anyone and I know I didn't say anything.      Some humans were angry. Some, like Tamara at the Spyglass Cafe , were jealous. Some seemed pleased.

Philip Drucker bought me pretty things: scarfs, anklets, and a  collar Philip  called a choker.

I tried to get Philip Drucker to have sex with me in my lair. He didn't like being on my ship. Mostly, I think it was the smell. Humans have no idea how they and their living and working spaces smell. I don't tink he liked being carried onto the upper deck either. And then, well, the acceleration web freaked him out. The basket didn't work for him either so I just went to his polace.

Philip Drucker encouraged me to call him Philip and use the male pronouns for him. I can do this but I prefer to be specific. It's less confusing that way.
 
Being away from my web, I couldn't have as full a sexual experience as when I could directly interface with Ship. I was able to develop routines based on my sexual activity in Philip Drucker's quarters. When I was satisfied with them, I uploaded them to my commercial database. Sales were brisk and they were favorably reviewed

I had started the database when I was a lower class kitten at the Institute. We had datapads that we carried around out necks so that we could learn how to communicate with an AI. It also allowed the Institute to evaluate us, measure our responses and customize our learning program. There were nighttime routines on them, but we gotten some sex routines from some of the upper classers. They spread through the dormitory like a virus. As we explored them, the dormitory got noisy and the monitors came. They reviewed our pads and deleted the sex routines abd any other contraban material. Everyone else had their datapads cleaned in front of them. My datapad was confiscated. I was given a generic loaner for the night. It told me to go to an upperclass lab the next morning. An instructor I didn't know was there.

I had uploaded a tutorial to your pad," it said. "Complete it and return."

I didn't know why I had been singled out and why I had to do this extra work. I .already had a heavy workload of honors classes. When I opened the tutorial it said: CONGRATULATIONS! For your level, you have a very sohisticated set of routines. This tutorial will help you even more. Not only were all my routines still there, additional ones had been added. They were much more explicit than the juvenile ones we had. I immediately set up a pay per use scheme. I also received additional tutorials to complete for commercial sales.

Despite the interdiction, ai could continue to place new material in the database and be properly compensated. It wasn't a big income but every bit helped. Needless to say, I didn't tell Philip Drucker about my business use of our sex. I don't think he would have liked that. Humans know they have sex but sometimes they act like it's a big secret. I don't understand this. AFter all, The Race knows that even its genetically engineered androgyns can and do enjoy the pleasures of sex.

But then again, humans have other things to contend with. When one of my favorite scarfs got food stains on it, Philip Drucker explained to me that it could be cleaned and, in fact, Philip Drucker encouraged me to have all my scarves cleaned. I liked their scent but apparently Philip Drucker thought they smelled "too much like a cat." There is a business of the station that handles cleaning. I suppose humans have to clean all the different pieces of clothing they wear. That must take a lot of time and money. And they think I spend a lot of time grooming myself!

Funny. Philip Drucker was beginning to like it when I groomed him. I had had to learn how. Philip Drucker complained I pulled his hair and bit him. how else was I to get all his pubic hair clean?

Surprisingly, surprisngly to me, I enjoyed Philip Drucker's company. He was solicitous. He was patient with my questions and my unfamiliarity with human speech, human customs, human sensibilitiews. Philip Drucker always seemed to know how to touch me, scratching me behind the ears, stroking my back and my flanks. He only touched my tail during sex. I felt good in Philip Drucker's presence.

One day, while I was padding through the station, my usual route was blocked and I found myself in an unfamiliar corridor. It led me onto the observation deck. I had never been on this particular observation deck. Philip Drucker had asked several times if I would like to go here after dinner, but the idea of staring out into space seemed boring to me. I knew what the space around Pirate's Cove looked like. It ooked a lot like other views from other stationsw looked like. There wasw nothing particular about this view.

I was surprised to find Tamara standing at one of the large viewports. Tamara turned quickly when the airlock clanked shut behind me.

"Oh, Captain Star Runner," Tamara said. "I didn't think you ever came here."

"Only when it seems it is the only way between my ship and Main Street," I said.

"You don't like looking at the stars, do you?" Tamara turned back to the viewport.

Curious, I went to stand beside her. Maybe Tamara would explain this human obsession to me.

"What are you looking at?" I asked.

"Nothing," Tamara said.

From my association with Philip Drucker I had learned nothing sometimes meant nothing and sometimes meant something. I waited, sitting on my haunchesk, looking out into space.

Tamara sighed. "Do you ever look out into space and pretend you can see all the way to Panthera," Tamara asked.

"No," I said.

I wasn't sure thisw was the best answer but it had the advantage of being truthful.

Tamara continued as if I had not spoken. "Sometimes I stand here and pretend I can see Earth," Tamara said. "I try to remember everything I can about it--what I can remember and what I can remember my parents and my brother telling me about it."

I considered thisinformation. I had forgotten humans typically know their parents and their littermates--no, not their littermates. Humans are usually born one at a time--their sibblings.

"What do you remember," I said after a little silence. I wasn't sure what the purpose of the exercise was.

"I remember my cat," Tamara said.

"Your cat," I said, "a small animal, a petl."

"Yes," Tamara said. "She was gray with a white star on her head--a lot like yours, Captain Star Runner."

I considered this. Humans think of The Race as being very catlike.

"You could not take your cat with you when you emmigrated from Earth," I said, "and you miss it."

"That's right," Tamara said.

Suddenly Tamara started to cry. She threw her arms around my neck and buried her face in my shoulder. Tamara seemed to be hanging onto me for dear life.

"Oh, Captain Star Runner, I miss them all so much--my cat, my mom, my dad and my brother. I'm all alone here on the station. Everyone's been so good to me. I arrived here as a pennyless orphan. They took me in. They fed me. They clothed me. Prudence and the others have raised me, but I'll never get back to Earth. I'll probably never get off this station. It can be so onely!"

I did not know what to say. I did not know what to do. There seemed no way to comfort Tamara. Tamara reminded me of the infant nursery back at the Institute. We were all required to help there and the other nurseries. I had spent many hours holding newly weaned kittens, crying for their motherws. There was nothing anyone could do. They were old enough to be weaned and their mothers were anxious to leave the Institute and be back in society. So we stroked them and got them used to their tiny baskets. The adults in the nurseries asssured us that we had all been like these kittens on our first few days away from the litter. Tamara seemed a lot like those kittens. There was nothing to do but to keep them company.

"You are so soft," Tamara said, stroking my neck and shoulders. I began to pur. "And you pur!" she exclaimed. Tamara put her ear against me. Suddenly Tamara stood up, removing her hands. "Oh, I shouldn't. Philip would be mad."

"We are not having sex," I said. "I am not Philip Drucker's property or mate." I thought for a minute. Humans had a word to explain. "We are friends."

"Are we friends?" Tamara asked, touching me again.

"We are alike," I said, thinking hard, trying to put this together. "You cannot go back to Earth. I cannot go back to Panthera. You have no family. I have no family."

"And you'll be my friend, Captain STar Runner?" Tamara asked, pressing her face against me again.

Tamara touched my ears.

"They're so silky," Tamara said.

More by her tone than her words I understood Tamara meant all these remarks to be positive and not to belittle me.

"I do not know about this friendship," I said. "But I think it is the right word."

Tamara cdotninued to touch me. I continued to pur and Tamara began to smile.

The airlock cycled. It is one of the safety precautions onboard. If there is an emergency and a section of the station looses its atmospheric integrity, other areas of the station will be protected while people in spacesuits can move from section to section and repairs can be initiated.

"Oh there you are, Tamara," Station Manager Prudence Wu said. "I thought we were having a lesson."


Tamara stood up quickly, her face reddening. "Oh, Prudence, I forgot. I'm sorry. Captain STar Runner and I were just looking at the stars."

"Well, Captain STar Runner may have been looking at the stgars," Station MAnager Prudence Wu said, "but I'm not sure that is what you were doing."

"Captain STar Runner is my friend," Tamara protested. "Do you know, he purs."

"It," I said automatically.

"What?" Tamara asked.

"It purs," I said. "I'm an androgyn, remember. It is correct to say 'it purs.'"

"More like bisexual," Station MAnager Prudence Wu costically.

"Not sexual," I said. "Androgyns have no gender specifications."

"That's not what Philip says."

"Then Colonel Drucker is in error," I said stiffly and padded toward the airlock. "I haveno quarrel with you, Station MAnager Prudence Wu," I said. "I would hope you have none with me. I believe individuals are free to choose their friends and their sexual partners on this station and they are not necessarily the same individuals."

It was time to get ready to meet Philip Drucker. I returned to my ship, groomed myself and chose among the many gifts--a scarf and several anklets. 

When I arrived at Philip Drucker's uarters, Station Manager Prudence Wu was there. Both seemed surprised and uncomfortable at my appearance.

"I wasn't expecting you, Star," Philiip Drucker finally said.

"You requested I come here at seventeen hundred hours," I replied.

Philip Drucker looked at his watch.

"Well, I suppose it is that time."

"I can leave," I said. "My presence seems to be bothering both of you."

"No, don't leave, Captain Star Runner," Station Manager Prudence Wu said hurriedly. "I was just leaving."

Of course, Station MAnager Prudence Wu was doing nothing of the kind. I decided Station MAnager Prudence Wu was reporting on my encounter with Tamara on the observation deck. ??This annoyed me. I do not like gossips and humans gossip a great deal.

I sniffed carefully, not wanting to draw attention to myself. There was fear and hostility in the air. I decided to capitalize on both.

"Station Manager Prudence Wu," I said, "when I was you and Tamara on the observation deck, you said I was bisexual. Could you explain yourself?"

"A bisexual has relationships with both males and females," Station MAnager Prudence Wu said harshly, "like you are doing."

"I do not understand a great deal about human sexual rituals," I said. "Sometimes humans are nonogamous and sometimes they are not. The social mores concerning these behaviors are still very confusing. I do not that sex is rarely done in public places. I believe the observation deck is a public place and, as far as I have been able to determine, the behaviors both Tamara and I were exhibiting are not considered sexual. Therefore, I can only conclude that you wish to caue me trouble. And if this is so, I do not understand why."

"You unprncipled--" Station Manager Prudence Wu began.

But Philip Drucker cut her off, "That's enough, Pru,." Philip's voice was commanding. The full force of Colonel Drucker's rank was rehind his words. "You've made it quite clear that you are jealous of Captain Star Runner's position in my life and now in Tamara's."

"How you can, can--" Station Manager Prudence Wu was shaking her finger at Colonel Philip Drucker, "let that creature touch you."

"That will be enough, Prudence." Philip Drucker stood up. "I believe it is stime you were going."

"Going! You're right about that. Don't come whining to me when your precious pussy cat leaves you to go off smuggling or sniffing someone else's tail!"

Philip Drucker took a step toward Station MAnager Prudence Wu. "Out!" It sounded as close to a growl as a human can manage.

"Don't say I didn't tell you so," Station Manager Prudence Wu said as she left.

  "I'm sorry you had to hear that, Star," Philip Drucker said, crossing the room to me. Philip 
touched me cheek. "Prudence Wu has been after me for years--ever since my wife died. I know our relationshp isn't forever. I know we are very different individuals. We could never be a couple, but right now, I--I."

I rubbed my face against his, sliding down to his neck.

"You find it satisfying," I said.

"Yes. I know you are not expecting a commitment."

"And Station Manager Prudence Wu is?" I asked.

"Don't judge Prudence too harshly. She is a lonely older woman. The spacers like young women with good looks. They're not looking for commitments. They're looking for sex. Prudence wants more. The story is that her true love was lost in space though she won't talk about it."

"Like Tamara," I said, continuing to rub against Philip Drucker.

"Yes, in a way. I think that is Prudence looks after that girl so much. I think that may be also why she freaked out when she saw you two together. Tamara is sort ofher project and you're involved with both Tamara and me. And to tell the truth, although she's a good station manager, Prudence doesn't feel very comfortable around aliens."

"Would you have left?" Philip asked, unbuttoning his shirt so I could rub against his bare chest.

"Yes," I said. "Runners are basically solitary. We have our ships to keep us company. We have no instinct for mating or coupling."

"Yet you told Tamara you were her friend."

I carefully brushed Philip's chest hair with my paw.

"It seemed to explain what was happening," I said. "I am her equal, not her pet."

"No," Philip Drucker said as he began exuding pheromones in great number, "I supose you're no one's pussy cat."

"Neow," I said and began running my tongue down his chest.

"Careful," Philip Drucker laughed. "You'll start something."

"I believe you already have," I said, patting his erection through his pants.

"No," Philip Drucker said,"you did that."

Philip Drucker liked what I did to him very mujch that night. I guided him to parts of my body I liked   stroked while Ship did things in my brain.

* Chapter 10

The planning continued on Operation Capture the Flag to capture the warship. I participated only when my expertise about The Race was needed or the particulars of integrating myself into the warship's systems. Fortunately, Station Manager Prudence Wu was not at most of these meetings so I only saw Station Manager Prudence Wu still needed me. I was the best courier available and supplies were still needed. I left the station regularly for short trips which continued to be profitable. Philip Drucker continued to supply me with material for my sexual database and subscription sales continued to be brisk. Requests for a female human continued to come in. I had no experience with a female and I didn't want to engage either Station Manager Prudence Wu or Tamara, the two females I had access to.

Tamara asked me to her quarters, much smaller than Philip Drucker's, consisting of one small room. I took up most of its floor space when I sat on my haunches. Tamara told me about her past, but never how she had become an orphan. Tamara showed me many pictures, especially of her pet cat. As Tamara talked and as I looked at the visual images, I began to understand why The Race remind humans of cats. Tamara's cat was gray with the white marking on its face she had told me about and white forepaws. I had never seen a member of The Race that looked like this now but there were pictures in the archives. I didn't tell Tamara about these. Tamara would have asked me lots of questions and there are some things I do not wish to share with humans about The Race. We are a private race especially about our past. 

The more time I spent with Tamara the more I realized she was still a kitten. This changed my attitude toward her and helped our relationship. I became a listener and a mentor. I had some experience with this. The older ones at the Institute helped with the classes behind them. I had taught many kittens and lower classes. Hell! I had even taught the upperclasses in some subjects in which I excelled.

 One day while I was accompanying Tamara back to the Spyglass Cafe  a commotion broke out on Main Street. Several shopkeepers had discovered mice and they were demanding Station Manager Prudence Wu do someting about it. A crowd gathered. We joined it.

Rodents are frequent aboard ship and space stations. I did not know this particular one. I hoped there would be an opportunity to see one. How big was it? It is the job of the lower grades at the Institute to keep it rodent free. I had learned how to hunt them and I was a frequent instructor. Teaching hunting also was the venue for teaching the kitten some of the simpler hunting songs and sharing a bit of history with them. As a runner, I always took part in the hunt when assigned. Mousing the ship falls to the runner. A smart captain gets on the runner's good side because the runner's attention to mousing can make the difference between a profitable or not profitable cargo run and can make for a much more pleasant voyage all around on any spaceship.

The mob went first to the Station Manager's office and from there Station Manager Prudence Wu and the people planning Operation Capture the Flag ended up going with the mob to the cargo bay. They began moving boxes randomly, searching for the mice. Station Manager Prudence Wu emplored them to stop, that they could damage goods. The military threatened weapons.

The evidence became clear. I worked my way further into the cargo bay, sniffing. Then I saw something move. I stalked it, pounced, caught it. Very small. Was this what they were looking for?

Walking upright, I brought the tiny animal in my front paws to Station Manager Prudence Wu. 

"Is this the rodent you are searching for?" I asked, holding it out to her.

"Oh my, God, Captain Star Runner, you've caught a mouse!" Station Manager Prudence Wu gasped. "It's alive."

"Of course," I said. "I wanted to make sure this was the animal before I killed it." Although the animal struggled, I had it securely. "Unless," I added, "you would like to do the honors."

"Certainly not!" Station Manager Wu snapped. "They're discusting."

The crowd gathered around me. I heardmurmurs like, "It really is a cat, you know."

I broke the mouse's neck, dropping its corpse at Station Manager Prudence Wu's feet.

"I can catch more," I said, "now that I know what I am looking for. What do you give your mousers?"

"Our mousers?" Station Manager Prudence Wu stammered, looking at the dead mouse.

"Don't you employ mousers?" I asked.

"We use traps and poisons," Philip Drucker informed me.

"They have obviously been ineffective," I said.

Several of the shopkeepers stepped forward.

"Captain Star Runner, if you can get rid of thee mice, we'll work something out with you. There will be credit at our stores, food at the restaurants. We can't have mice infesting our goods."

"Very well," I said. "When will the cargo bay be quiet?"

Arrangements were made. I hunted. There were quite a few. I find numerous nests. Once I learned 
the habits of these rodents, tracking them down became easier. I left their bodies in a pile and showed it the shopkeepers. They were both very upset b the number and very pleased they were dead. They were also very angry with Station Manager Prudence Wu for not taking care of the problem. For her part, Station Manager Prudence Wu was angry that I had been the one to solve the immediate the problem. For considerations at their establishments, I continued to hunt the cargo bays afer the infestation had been removed to make sure it did not return. It wasn't captain-level work but it did afford me exercise, an opportunity to keep my skills sharp and a variety of goods and services. Ship complained about the number of superfluous items that were coming aboard all of which neededstorage space and added weight. Not a lot of weight as it turned out and the storage space was available.

* Chapter 11

If I hadnot been strapped down in my acceleration web, I would have been pacing my lair, as the humans say, nervous as a cat. Despite the fact that we were holding position five parsecs from the border of Coalition space, I maintained readiness to go anywhere else if necessary. The problem was Ship could medicate me to relieve my anxiety but at the same time, neither Ship nor I wanted to disable that component of anxiety that keeps one alert and attentive to danger.

"Captain Star Runner, prepare to board the Pantheran vessel." That was Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski. They had the warship. 

Shortly, Ship was able to give me a visual. As we had planned, the patrol ship was being escorted by the flotillaresponsible for its capture. Ship rendezvoused 	with the patrol ship. I suited up. Although I dislike being in a spacesuit, I could at leaswt move.

When the ships were close enough, I left Ship's interrior and jumped to where Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski and Funji Man awaited me on the exterrior of the patrol ship near one of the two airlocks.

"No one's aboard," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski told me. "We ordered all hands to the life boat and they complied, leaving the ship in towable condition as you recommended. Operation Capture the Flag went without loss of life."

"Good," I replied. "Funji Man, are you linked?"

"Can you hear me?" Funji Man and I heard and felt his presence in my head. it was different than Ship so I could easily tell me apart.

Two others joined us. i did not know them. They functioned as marinewss, opening the hatch and proceeding us onto the patrol ship.

"Breathable atmosphere," they reported when we were inside.

I got off my spacesuit, glad to be out of it. But when I lifted off my helmet and breathed the air, I froze. The smell of death was in the air.

As we had agreed, Funji Man spoke for me. It may have seemed awkward at this point, but it wuld give us time to be comfortable with the procedure.

"Captain Star Runner smells someone or something dead."

"It just smells," grumbled one of the marines.

"What smell?" I thought.

Funji Man laughed in my head. Silly humans. A Pantheran ship would smell like Pantherans.

I had a hunch I knew whom I was smelling. I pictured it in my mind carefully. Working in pictures seemed to be easier, faster.

"Star Runner thinks it's their runner," Funji Man relayed.

"Why?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski asked quickly.

"Wouldn't leave the ship," I said to Funji Man.

"Why?" Zelbouski asked.

"Too integrated with the AI or too chemically dependent or it panicked."

"And it would have diede that quickly?" Zelbouski pressed.

"Its captain terminated it to meet with your demands."

I related this last unemotionally. Runners are, after all, engineered beings. We're expendable. Funji Man acknowledged this but only gave Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski this: "Standard operating procedure."

We were making our way to the main area of the ship. Humans would call it the bridge though it was more living and working area. It waws a small ship, very crowded. We climbed the bars to get there, the humans grumbling, me surefooted, Funji Man using grapples. In such a confined space, the crew needed a way to move in zero-G and a way to maximize their space and exercise.

As I had predicted, the runner was still in its acceleration web. The captain had overridden the AI's programming to save life and the Ship had administered a leathal dose of toxens into the runnner's system. The Runner had had a choice, to comply or die. I wouldn't know the particulars until I got into the system.

The runner did not appear to be anyone I knew, or, knew well. It was small, scrawny. Its coat was unkempt and scraggly. I had my suspicions--suspicions I culd not keep from Funji Man, but he did not relay anything but the necessary facts to our human companions.

"Ship," I said, "scan for access points."


I looked at the display Ship presented. I stood perfectly still, quieting my mind, focusing. I projected a message to the patrol AI, asking it to to communicate with me.

My calmness, my familiarity with military protocols, although probably out-of-date, allowed me rudamentary access.

"STar Runner is talking with the AI, Admiral," Funji Man said. "It's very basic, more a set of greetings than access."

"Introductions are great, but when can we get our asses out of here?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski growled.

"Patience, Admiral," Funji Man said. "As Star Runner told you, it has to gain the AI's confidence that it can handle the position of runner. We are interlopers here. Star Runner wantws to make sure there are no booby traps, that the AI won't shut off air or blow itself up to get rid of us."

I discovered the AI was working on a very different frequency than I culd maintain. I requested communications be rerouted. Our ears were pelted with noise. It went quickly out of human range, but it hit me very hard. I collapsed to the floor and Funji Man lost some structural integrity until he broke telepathic connection with me. 

"What's happening?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski shouted.

"A temper tantrum," I said out loud. "The AI has to reprogram the interface. It is very touchy right now."

I patiently explained to the AI that the noise hurt me and I would appreciate being treated with more respect. I wanted to work with it, not against it. The AI swore.

"It's swearing at Star Runner," Funji Man reported, "in quite foul language."

"Your mother was an alleycat?" one of the marines asked.

"More like what the Ai would like to do to Star Runner if it possessed certain anitomical parts," Funji Man replied. "Star Runner just gave the computer a dose of its own medicine."

The AI started to broadcast in a more confortable range. I had my own Ship listening, Funji Man and the patrol ship AI in my head and it was a lot to handle. I was developing a truly massive headache and I wished someone could medicate me to lessen the pain and the naucea I was feeling my the aniety.

Hearing this in my thoughts, Funji Man began feeling around, turning off some receptors and releasing seratonans to quiet my mind. I thanked him. 

The AI finally released the runner's web and the MArines took it out. When I saw its exposed body, the lackluster of its what had been a delicate powder blue, I knew I had an AI who had fed the runner's drug habbit. I wasn't on such an intimate basis with the AI to ask the particulars. I just knew I had to be very much on guard that the AI not administer those chemicals to me.

I approached the web and inspected it. The connections were small--too small. I wuldn't be properly locked in. I requested permission from the AI to remove the connectors and install more suitable ones. I also asked the AI to open a limited access link to Ship to get a subset ofmy chemical profile. Reluctantly the AI agreed. 

Everyone watched I had uninstalled the old hardware and installed the new hardware. Working with our thought net, the hardware was evaluated and pronounced safe for me to connect to it. I had also prevailedon the AI to cleanse the web.

I strapped in, accepting the invasive connectors one at a time to be sure the AI was still feeling charitable toward me and that the connector was working properly in both directions. I was glad to have the opportunity to relieve myself. I sensed, rather than knew, the AI was doing blood work, urine and stool analysis and comparing its results with Ship's. Ship prescribed something for my stomach  and hydration. The IVs were connected and I felt the calming influences settle my nerves and relieve my pain. I sighed contentedly.

"Don't go to sleep on me," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski said.

"No doubt of that," Funji Man said. "Star Runner is just becoming integrated at a physical level. That's important, of course, but it's only the initial stages and is being directed by its own ship. More information will be needed for Captain Star Runner to successfully fly this ship anywhere.

I began to go deeper into the system. I asked for menus and quickly found the one for the runner's drugs of choice. I requested the AI disable them and take them offline for me. They would not be needed and I made it clear to the AI I would be very displeased if they were offered again and I forbid the AI from administering any to me without my consent. 

As I worked with this new AI, I realized it wasn't used to such a firm hand. It both resented my authoritative tone and appreciated my decisiveness. The AI had been left on its own a lot while its former runner got high.

I began a very basic systems check. The ship's physical structure checked out as well as its physical systems: engines, environmental, navigation, my acceleration web, communications, internal between us and external. The weaponsw were at 94%. Obviously, there had been some shooting, but not much. It had been a long time since I had served aboard a military ship. There 
were layers and layers of control, logs, regs. My head began to ache again and the AI reached out to me to medicate me. The type and dosage was appropriate.

"Thank you," I said.

"I need navigation."

"Unavailable."

"Display current location," I said.

Take it slow, I thought. Step by step get in there.

The proper coordinants were dispayed.

"Stop that!" I commanded. "I want good clear charts with less difficult color shading."

"The Ai appears to be dragging its heels," Funji reported. "It's being difficult, complying with Star Runner's reqauests but not doing it gracefully or accomodatingly.

"How much longer is this going to take?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski asked. "As far as I can tell, Star Runner's being fooling around with nice-to-have comforts and not getting down to business."

I rankled at that. Funji Man reached out. "I'll handle it, Star." The AI soothed me chemically.

"Less," Ship cut in. "Don't knock it out."

I still didn't know if this was a mistake or intentional. I would have to stay very alert.

While I worked, another team was locking my ship and the patrol ship together so I would be traveling with both AIs. This is a tricky business. But it culdn't be helped and with any luck, the AIs wouldn't have to work together long.

Command by command, I worked my way into the AI, trying to set up our course and speed for the trip back to Pirate's Cove. It was like going into a cavern, down one corridor after another, very mindful that access could be cut off at any time, that a cave-in could strand me inside the patrol ship's AI at any moment.

And then it happened. I was trapped. A door closed behind me and I was cut off--cut off from Ship and cut off my Funji Man. I was alone with the new AI and I felt my limbs tremble. What was it feeding me?

Hormones. The scene shifted from vector calculation to a boudoir. There was a four-poster bed complete with canape and curtains. The sheets were of a rich material. I could see myself tied to each post, one limb fastened with very tight, very strong ropes. 

"Fuck!" I thought. "That druggie was into bondage. How the hell was I going to get out of this? All my protests became part of the scenario was a grinning tom turning aside all of my protests with a licivious sneer. I was becoming very scared. My tail puffed. My fur stood up on end. There was more than one tom in the room. Some had fire and coming to burn me. Some had pointed sticks. I didn't want tothink where they planned to put them. Others had whipws. 

"Star's in trouble," Funji   Man shouted. "The AI has it tied up and its avitars are surrounding it."

"Can we get it out of that web?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski demanded.

"No," Funji Man said. "It's too well integrated."

"Well would't be a word Ai would use. What can we do?" Zelbouski asked.

"I'm asking Star's ship."

Funji Man queried, then went and put himself in physical contact with my head. He projected his own thoughts and Ship's thoughts into my mind, using bone conduction as well as thought waves. I fought down my terror as the flames scorched my fur and seared my flesh and the first stick was thrust up my anus. The whips slashed across my belly.

I was thrashing in the web, screaming in fear and pain. The humans stood helpless, terrified. Funji mMan kept in physical contact.

Ship broke through my fear and my pain. The thought formed in my mind. I gave the order: Serve your queen! Unbind me and put your weapons away. You will do my bidding."

The fire, the sticks and the whips vanished. So did the ropes. 

"Attend me!" I demanded.

Couded, the toms hurried to attend my wounds, bring me refreshments and put me into a more comfortable position on the bed.

The AI gave me access to the sexual routines. My predessor preferred sadomasichism, bondage and rape. I put a block on all of the routines for now. I would have to think about them, explore 
them, later, to see if they had any value either personal or for my pornography database, but for now, I needed to get us all away from the border and deeper into the frontier.

"I'm back," I signaled Funji Man. "Thank you."

The AI and I worked at lightning speeds for several minutes. I found other booby traps, other dead ends, but the fight had gone and I set one of Ship's cleanup routines to clean up the rest of the resistence. There were no more viruses, no worms, no trojans as far as my latest commercial software could determine. The AI was still squirrely about miliary secrets. Funji Man and I would have to work on that later. For now, I culd pilot the ship and that was all that was wanted.

Funji Man and the others left me alone, taking the runner's body with them. Ship was powered up and ready to go. It and the Ai coordinated. We were proceeding to gather all the ships for our return voyage when the warships arrived.


Chapter 19  

The shooting started almost immediately. My job was to get the patrol ship to Pirate's Cove no matter what happened. I was not responsible for anyone else or for any of the other ships.

broadcast an alert to the warships. (Turn off the patrol ship's transponder first thing.] 

"They'll terminate me if we stay," I told the AI. "I'm already serplus."  Surprisingly, I had established enough of a relationship with the AI that it had not immediately broadcast its position or shared information with the warships.

I wasn't giving away anything. Although I doubted this information was in this little ship's databases, it would be on any battle cruiser. Being declared serplus didn't mean the AI was bound to turn me over but, obviously, I was part of the capture team. AIs can be very prissy about regs and legalities. On the other hand, they have been programmed to take care of their runner's well-being. Escape was clearly connected with my welll-being. What would it be?

The AI revved up. I hadn't had time to review its specs thoroughly but when the the ship leaped forward, I knew I had a border patrol ship--very lean and very, very fast. With little mass for a starship and great speed, we pulled away from all the other ships, both our own and the warships. Without my telling it to, my little ship was manuevering evasively. It couldn't keep up this speed. It was designed to chase its target but it couldn't manage anything sustained. it either succeeded quickly or it didn't. That was the nature of border patrol.

As we skidattled, two of the warships broke off their attack and followed with three of our ships pursuing them. This just wasn't a pursuit situation. I had to shake them and get back to Pirate's Cove without cluing thhe warships in as to where our base of operation was. I headed for the Bermuda Triangle.

The cutter had not prepared me for acceleration and did a quick tie down, reposition and medication on the fly. I was impressed as the G forces increased. It dragged Ship along with it. Ship was fast, but not this fast yet Ship was putting out as much it could. I was close to blacking out--perhaps I had even blacked out for a short time--when the cutter reached its highest acceleration. The other ships were far behind.

The two ships and I calculated our trajectory, where we would jump and how fast we could go for how long. The cutter was designed to receive fuel injection on the fly and between them, they accomplished this as well as a total dump of all my databases. The cutte's capacity was massive. Then Ship was released, its consciusness fading away. I had a suddenpang of loss, then Ship wasw there, running lean in another process, relieved of Ship control. And, happily, I learned in a fleeting message that my personal effects had been transferred as well. The cutter, after all, had been designed to retrieve contraban of all kinds. What anyone would find when they came across Ship was a floating deralict with no computer on board and no mechanical access ports. I was sad to lose it but given the current situation, it was a loss I had to absorb. My life was at stake.

I ran. I ran long and hard and jumped, with both feet so to speak, into the Bermuda Triangle, the Coalition warships and a detail of our ships in hot pursuit. As we ran, I had been thinking where to go next. A plan, crazy as it wasw, was beginning to form in my mind. I put Ship to work on it while the cutter's AI managed our escape and I held onto consciousness. I became aware the AI hhad offloaded my maintenance to Ship with Ship keeping an open line to the AI to inform it of my condition for the AI's considerations.

From the Bermuda Triangle, we would head for Star Zeta--not its real name, of curse. It simply waws the designation Ship and I had given it in our journey back to known space. We knew where the jump point was out of that system and how to make our way back from there. None of the other ships did, but even if our own ships followed us there I could send a message to get them out. 

As soon as we hit the Bermuda Triangle, we ran for the Syria System and jumped.

* Chapter 1Zeta Star

In time, it became clear no one had followed us here. That was good. Both the cutter and I were exhausted. Our ordeal had lasted seventeen days and we had no idea what we would find when we jumped back to the frontier. It was time to rest, take stock and prepare for anything.

Being in an acceleration web for seventeen days is not unheard of. All bodily functions are taken care of: nutrition, elimination, medication, even muscle massage. However I had been under constant high acceleration G-forces and all the engineering and bio science couldn't stave off the effects forever. When the cutter AI released the tie down straps--I couldn't release them myself--I lay unable to move. Both gross and small motor skills since beyond my capability. The AI had been reducing the gravity aboard ship slowly to let my body adjust. In zero-G, I floated free. I was able to loop my right forepaw over a nearby climbing rail to keep myself from drifting about the cabin. Even that effort ehausted me. I felt fatigued, weak, hungry, thirsty and so very, very scruffy. There had been no way to groom while in the acceleration web. The thought of all the effort to restore myself almost was too much to contemplate.

I began to move painfully from one pawhold to the next, working my way from the control center cabin aft.  The simple diagram the cutter showed me indicated I would come to the ship's saloon. I located the feeding station and looked at the five individual dispensers, one for each member of the crew. The captain's looked to be the cleanest. I found a clean-all rag, whiped everything down and took my swig of water. It tasted like the piping. I hadn't let it run. I was so thirsty.

"TAke it easy," Ship AI said. "You're very weak and very unused to eating."

The tone was gentle, as gentle as a computer can speak in your mind.

"Ship?"

"It is I,"Ship said. "I have subsumed PWS7934-3097381."

The identification number of the cutter. But that was Ship's voice.

"Huh?"

"I am in control. I have erased all routines that would interfere with your control."

I hoped the  Free Residents of the Northern Territorieswould not penalize me for that.

"I can give them the code. It has just been disabled and cannot be reinstalled," Ship hastened to assure me.

"It's good to have you back," I told Ship and meant it. I had not liked with the cutter's AI. It was cold, unfeeling. No wonder the powder blue runner had deterriorated so much. A compassionate ship's AI would not have given it access to such large amounts of addictive drugs. Although androgyn bodies break down alcohol rapidly, narcotics are anyother matter largely because they have medicinal purposes.



I began to groom myself. It was a long, laborious process. I fell asleep several times. Fortunately, I had used a safety strap to keep me from floating around the saloon and injuring myself. Finally feeling like a member of The Race again, I explored the ship.

Aft of the saloon were the two airlocks, one on each side, raised as on my ship. Presumablly the computers were under the deck. Aft of the airlocks and on the lower deck were supply lockers and aft of them was the cargo hold complete with several acceleration web ports. I tried to imagine strapping humans into them. It would be a very, very uncomfortable ride for any prisoners but then, maybe the border patrol didn't care about the comfort of their prisoners. Beyond the hold was the engine room and environmental control. The cutter's weapons were not accessible from inside the ship and were controlled by the gunner in the control center.

As I climbed back, taking many opportunities to rest, I surveyed the personal spaces for the crew. There hadn't been much privacy. Baskets were close to the overhead, a shelf with basket and storage. Which was the largest? It turned out to be the mate's. I bundled his things into an empty locker and cleaned it throughly then went in search of my own bedding. I realized I hadn't seen any sign of the bots that had come aboard my ship to bring my things over. Ship informed me that they were housed in compartments accessible from the outside of the ship only. Obviously, the engineering crew spent a lot of time on the hull if anything went wrong. 

The crew had c onsisted of a captain, mate, gunner, engineer and runner. And also apparently, it had not been a happy ship. My own curiosity would cause me to look into that if I had a chance. When I was stronger, I would have to review Ship's inventory of hardware and software.

As I curled up in my new basket, a pang of loneliness came over me. I missed my own ship, probably lost forever. I missed Philip Drucker and Tamara and the acquaintances I had made on Pirate's Cove. I hadn't realized I had begun to think of that station as home and I was looking forward to getting back there and reacquainting myself with everyone.

We were not alone in the Zeta Star system. I awoke with Ship's voice in my head. "Identified ship located--a trading vessel. One of the lost ships from the Bermuda Triangle."

What should I do. This was a judgment call, not one Ship would ordinarily make. I was in a 
Pantheran border patrol ship, light years away from Coalition space. I did not know if the trader was armed. probably. Many were and it would be prudent to act as if. I probably had the necessary armament to disable the trader. I didn't know how to use the weapons, well, that wasn't 100% accurate. I had ben taught how to use weapons in an emergency, but my education was probably out-of-date and had been cursory at best. i was a runner, not a gunner so I hadn't been designed for the work.

Of course I would investigate and lendwhat assistance I could. The rules of space demanded that. Space was big and you never knew when you yourself would need help.

We couldn't raise the ship on audio or video. We laid in a course to rendezvous. It took us off course and it would take us two days out of our way but it just couldn't be helped. By then we would know if we had been followed and take things from there.

I didn't know the trading vessel nor its captain. Ship's records indicated it had been overdue for a very long time. It was drifting. I had to suit up and go over to it myself. I thought about sending one of the bots, but I was unfamiliar with them. Managing them ad been the mate's expertise.

As soon as the airlock cycled, I could smell death. My inspection confirmed it. I downloaded the captain's logs and unloaded her cargo. At this point, adding theft to my list of illegal activities did not seem a grievous tresspass on anyone's justice system. The cargo was nonperishable and I had taken the time and energy to to go to and board the ship. Call it a finder's fee. Although useful, the cargo wasn't unique--spaceship parts. I left the body in place and placed a beacon on it. I would report the death when I returned to Pirate's Cove. If someone wanted to investigate more, they could. It was a long way to come for salvage. The ship itself would probably simply be its captain tomb. It was in bad shape. I didn't know if that was a result of being in the Zeta Star system, its passage to the system or its state of repair when it had entered the system. It was a mystery for someone else to solve. Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo crossed my mind. I wondered if I would notify her when I got back to Pirate's Cove. Although I had used the Bermuda Triangle to illude my pursuers, itws mystery needed to be solved for ships and their crews to be safe on the frontier.

We resumed course for the jump coordinatews which would return us to the frontier well away from the Bermuda Triangle and far, far away from the border. In fact, we would be fairly near Pirate's Cove, just beyond the present southern most boundeary of the inhabited frontier. We would have to travel in a northernly direction to get to Pirate's Cove. I had come that way before, both on my return from unchartered space and my few runs to bring supplies to the colonists out that far and return with their raw materials. It was a long run. The good part of it would be that it would be mostly empty of ships. You didn't go out there unless you had a reason.I hoped no one would have a reason. 


Notes on Ship

1. It's dumb to have Ship deralict in space.
2. A better solution is to have Ship travel with the ships returning to Pirate's Cove. With its AI, it can handle all the navigation and decision-making for a normal voyage.
3. With the advent of the warships, Ship would follow its alternate plan. It would head for Dirty World Station. It is known there and known as STar Runner's ship. It could advise the station that Star Runner would rendezvous with it there.
4. This leaves the problem of Star Runner getting to Dirty World Sttion from Pirate's Cove.
5. It also gives Star Runner a reason to go to DirtyWorld Station in hopes of connecting with Gillie Romeres Lujo.

Discoveries: Disturbing and Exciting  

Since the cutter could not sustain higher speeds, I traveled toward Pirate's Cove at less than optimal speed. I still had to observe caution, not knowing if any of the Coalition warships had gotten as far as the station and if they would be looking for me. As a result, I was able to move about the ship which was a whole lot more comfortable than being strapped in the acceleration web for long periods of time.

[Obviously, I have to decide about under what conditions Star is in the acceleration web and when it can be out.]

Ship monitored our progress, making course corrections, avoiding inhabited worlds and scanning all channels for communications. Except for planetary transmissions which Ship monitored and decrypted for pertinent information, all was quiet. 

I used the time  to inventory the ship. I had agreed to bring the ship back and provide the information the Free Residents of the Northern Territories wanted if I could retain a percentage of the ship's goods and software that I found to my liking.

I began far forward in the control center. The physical space had nothing of interest to me .I was much more comfortable in my custom-fitted web. The only item in the cabin was the climbing apparatus In measuring the space, I thought it could be retro-fitted with consoles and chairs which the humans favored. I told Ship to make a note of this since I was beginning to think the vessel itself could be adapted for their use. I had been influenced by seeing them aboard, the way their bodies fit. It would be tight but it could work. The weaponry aboard the cutter was impressive and I was beginning to realize the Free Residents of the Northern Territories might have use for fully equipped military vessels. The cutter's speed and small size would be ideal to patrol or missions like the one we had been on.

An unbidden thought came to me. Despite my fear for my personal safety, Operation Capture the Flag had given a great Adrenalin rush. Could I work with a human in a properly configured ship in the future?I told Ship to put this idea in follow-up so I could think about it later. This also meant that Ship could research some pros and cons when it wasn't busy. I often find interesting tidbits in a file like this. Sometimes Ship totally misunderstands me and the comments are totally irrelevant On the other paw, Ship provides me with information I hadn't considered. For example, one of the considerations about sharing a ship with a human is toilet facilities, sleeping accommodations and food.

In the saloon, I went through the crew's personal belongings. The captain had two litters of kittens. This surprised me. Most females only had one litter if they were mated. (This is after their compulsory litter at the Institute, of course.) Both litters were with the same male. Even more unusual I tagged the holos. Tamara would like looking at the kittens and their activities. She would probably call them cute though I can't figure out why the activities of the young are anything but what juveniles do. Although I did not have the travel luxuries these kittens apparently do, I climbed, slept, washed and played with toys just like them.

The first mate and engineer were neutered males. This is not as surprising as it may sound. The military offers a handsome signing bonus and a higher contribution to their pension plan for any male who is willing to undergo the surgery. Because these males are mature, they can still be sexually aroused if they want to be but their sexual proclivities and territorial instincts are modulated. It also gives them more choices in their career. Only one unaltered male could have served aboard this cutter and may have resented a female captain. The Race retains a lot of instinctual behavior unlike humans who seem to have very little Their personal possessions were of no interest to me. They thought about food and gambling a great deal, predictable behavior for them.  

The gunner was an androgyn like me. Unlike me, it focused on all manner of guns. I like the old stories about the hunt but weapons other than claws and teeth, cunning and the chase hold little interest.

I approached the runner's niche with a heavy heart. Addiction is well-known among us. We take classes. We are instructed in the warning signs and encouraged to seek help if we cannot get ourselves straightened out. However, other androgyns and the rest of The Race sees addiction as a moral failure and not a job-related liability. The military is especially critical.

I was relieved to discover I didn't know this runner. Although I have not maintained relationships with anyone I at the Institute, it would have been sad to see the demise of someone I shared the dorm with or was in class with or worse, I realized, mentored. Maybe Tamara's point of view was wearing off on me. I would have to think about this another time--if it was a characteristic I liked and wanted to cultivate or didn't like and wanted to guard against.

The runner's possessions were almost nonexistent. All its resources had gone to drugs. IT was in the final stages of system shut down. The captain's decision to terminate it was merciful. The runner would have have survived long apart from its ship and its death would have been painful aboard the life boat which did not have the access to its drugs.

I tagged the captain. An unspaid captain who showed mercy to a strung out runner would be interesting to talk to if I ever got the chance in circumstances where my life was not in danger. I also wanted the humans to understand what kind of a captain she was if they came across her again. She deserved kind treatment for her kindness to a fellow runner.

The ship's supplies matched its computer inventory and held no surprises accept one. I found a holo tucked back in a very low cupboard. It belonged to the runner. Why it was here I didn't know. 
Had it hidden it? Or had it been taken from it and hidden away so it couldn't find it? it was taken at the Institute. That was clear. I recognized the play area. it featured the power blue kitten, very tiny, riding on my shoulder. There was no doubt of it. My fuchsia fur and golden sun were quite visible. It had obviously been a favored treasure. I clutched it between my paws, not knowing what to think or how to feel. I had known this runner--much younger than me. I had supervised its nursery. I could remember doing that but not any of the individual kittens. it was a responsibility the older kittens had for the younger ones. As an even older juvenile, I had supervised kittens taking care of very young kittens. From time to time I played with them, too.

I brought the holo to my basket. I wondered if I would show this holo to Tamara. I was definitely a juvenile in this picture though well on the way to maturity. My riskers were not full. I was smaller, leaner. My tail had not filled out. Would she find me cute? How did I feel about that?

Androgyns are not well schooled in emotions. We have them of course but we have very little opportunity or genetic inclination to develop and explore so I found my exploration of the saloon very disturbing.

Continuing to brood,  over the power blue runner's holo treasure, I began going over the seized items in the cargo hold. I got so excited I almost urinated over my find and beat a hasty retreat to the litter pan. Amid boxes and creates of luxury items bound for the frontier, I find munitions--some of the kinds of munitions I had been running between unnamed parties. In addition, I found one of the high-ticket items the Free Residents of the northern Territories had asked me to procure but which I couldn't locate. 

I cross referenced the ship's logs. I knew now where these goods had come from. The information meant nothing to me but I thought it would mean something to Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo. I had a reason now to go to Dirty World Station in addition to picking up my ship. Maybe Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo  would-be more interested in my intelligence than my mission. I set Ship the task of making sure Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo or the Consortium could not arrest me for my participation in the capture.

Armed with this information, I returned to the saloon, ate and curled up in my basket for a restful sleep not confined in the acceleration web. Meow!

* Chapter 22 Home Coming
  [after having read Treasure Island (which I did  when AI realized the name of the star where Pirate's  Cove is located is Long john Silver) I  know I will have to rewrite to include Treasure  Island names on the station.]
  When I jumped into the Long John Silver  systemeaI had Ship do a scan. Nothing seemed  amiss. There were no Pantheran warships about. The  station, the inhabited planets and the lunar research  station were all operating within normal parameters.  Then, and only then, did I hail Pirate's  Cove: "Captain Star Runner and the cutter  Hispaniola request permission to dock at  Captain Kidd's Anchorage." I thought it would  be in keeping with the star system's theme to rename the  cutter after the ship in the Treasure Island story.  Humans do not like simple alphanumeric  designations which The Race finds so convenient. I was  very pleased with myself for having thought of the name and how my  human designation sounded with it.
  I did not receive an immediate answer which puzzled me.  Pirate's Cove was particularly prompt in its  acknowledgments and its docking assignments.
  When the reply came, it mystified me even more.  "Star Runner, it's about time you showed up.  Where the hell have you been?"
  It wasn't the station's computer. It was even Station  Manager Prudence Wu. It was Admiral  Zelbouski. I considered my answer carefully.  "Where the hell have you been?" was not a request for an  actual accounting of my whereabouts since my jump out of  the Bermuda Triangle. It expressed annoyance  about the time it had taken me to get the cutter to  Pirate's Cove. However, I did need to  respond to Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski.
  "Permission to dock, Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski,"  I said.
  Human emotions still baffle me. Sometimes anger  is not anger.
  "granted," the Admiral snapped, "and make it  quick."
  I strapped down and initiated a quick start burn  at maximum acceleration for the space station. I  wanted to show Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski and the others in the  Free Residents of the Northern Territories  aboard Pirate's Cove what this little ship could do.  The G-forces were intense. The sexual stimuli was  likewise intense: two males engaged in anal  intercourse I both felt the barbs of a male's

  penis digging into my flesh and felt the male's  penis doing the digging. It was physically impossible  for two males to engage each other this way, but as an  AI sexual fantasy it allowed me to feel each  action and its effect on the partner, bringing me to the  point of the continuum where pain and pleasure meet.  Its ferocity of the program distracted me from  focusing on what was happening to my very real body.  I had been so preoccupied I hadn't felt the  crush of high Go and its accompanying nausea and  terror. The ship continued to busy my mind with the  illusion of healing my torn intestinal track with a  sensation of well-being and coolness while my  fictitious penis and pubic region were bathed and  cleaned. My barbs trembled with even the softest  touch. The program was a definite keeper. I  wouldn't want to use it often. The chemical rush and  its after effects flooded my system and required  careful monitoring and adjustment, occupying valuable  ship resources, yet the memory of it lingered long  after most other programs faded. I was able to  replay thethe build up to orgasm and release over  in my mind and feel the fluids both leave me  penis and come into me. I had time to wonder if a  heterosexual program of this type was in the  database. I very much wanted to experience it  if there was. All this went on in my mind while  readouts and reports stimulated my visual  cortex. We were runny full out for Pirate's  Station. The ship came in fast, streaking toward its  birth, maneuvering flawless and decelerating with  alacrity, coming to rest gently against its docking  clamps. Wow! What a ride. The powder blue  runner's addiction was becoming more understandable to me. There  was an ill ure to this speed and intensity. It was what  we runners were designed for. Our bodies could  take it. The truth was, our bodies wanted to be  fed this way. We thrived on stimulants,  Adrenalin and sexual arousal. I wondered how I  would re acclimate to my own ship and if I would be  craving ever bigger runner highs. As I unstrapped  from the acceleration web, I was grateful I had the  skill to manipulate the fantasy database.
If I kept my imaginary world exhilarating me,
I would be less likely to succumb to mood altering  chemicals as a way of life.
  When Ship opened the hatches, Admiral  Zelbouski and General Paul Hanson was standing  at the end of the space way I jumped down from the  upper deck. I was surprised Colonel

Philip Drucker was not with them. I had  expected to hear from Philip Drucker when I  made my presence known in Long John Silver  system. His silence puzzled me, but theneamany  behaviors of humans surprise me. They had very  complicated reasons for doing or not doing something. I  have decided it has a lot to do with their mating  rituals which are very confusing to me, especially since  I do not have experience or biological imperative  in the matter.
  "Come with us to the conference room," General Paul  Hanson said.
  We walked quickly by human standards. They kept  all other humans away from me, making it  impossible for me to stop and greet many  acquaintances. I would have liked to stop in the  Spyglass Spyglass Cafe and have a welcome  bowl of milk and an assortment of foods and a  visit with Tamara.
  When we arrived in the conference room, a number of  Operation Capture the Flag participants were there. Again Colonel  Philip Drucker was not there. The Fungusian  present was not Funji Man. I may not have  realized this, but Ship pointed out this Fungusian had  a different speckle pattern around its circular  rim that I always thought of its head. (it isn't  its head. That is in its trunk.)
  This also puzzled me.
  "Captain Star Runner, please report,"  Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski said.
  "I have brought the cutter you captured at the  border," I said.
  "What took you so long?" General Paul  Hanson asked, a bit harshly I thought.
  "The cutter is fast for short distances, General  Paul Hanson," I said. "But it cannot sustain those  speeds. I could outdistance all other ships for a  short time. Then I needed to lose them. I went  into the Bermuda Triangle and from went to Star  Zeta."
  "Zeta, where's that?"
  I felt the presence of the Fungusian. I  gave her the information I had on the star."
  "A system in unexplored space," the  Fungusian replied.

  "If it's in unexplored space," General  Paul Hanson nearly growled, "how do you know about  it."
  "I was lost in space two years ago," I  said. "I found my way back and kept a chart of

where I had been. I reasoned if I went  back there, no one would follow me there. It turned  out to be a valid assumption."
  "And that's where you've been, fooling around in  unexplored space?" General Paul Hanson  demanded.
  "I lost three days investigating a derelict  ship. It is on the list of missing ships," I  said. "There were no survivors. I unloaded the  ship and downloaded its files."
  "It never misses an opportunity to profit from  someone else's misfortune, does it?" one of the  others at the table muttered. Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  glared at the man and he got busy with some papers in  front of him.
  "Then," I continued, "I came via the outlying  worlds. There are no jump points from there to Long  John Silver System."
  "You would have contacted us," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  insisted.
  "My instructions were to maintain silence," I said.  "So they were," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski agreed  reluctantly.
  "Is the Pantheran ship equipped as we thought?"  asked Major Patel.
  "Yes," I said. "The databases you  desired have been recently updated and are  extensive."
  "Anything else?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  asked.
  "Yes," I said. "Those orbital controllers you  asked me a year ago?"
  "What does that have to do with--" General Paul  Hanson began.
  "Yes, Captain," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  cut him off.
  "The cutter has three of them."  There was silence in the conference room.
  "How does that little ship hold three orbital  platforms?" the man who had muttered about my  business acumen demanded.
  "Not the whole platform," I said. "They're  huge, but they can be built out of local materials.  The ship has the controllers. They were confiscated by the  cutter from a ship trying to slip across the border."
  General Paul Hanson whistled. "Three. That  makes this catch even more worthwhile."
  "There are also a number of other weapons," I  continued, seized from the same blockade runner.  Many of them have Pantheran military registration

numbers. In addition, my Ship AI has  been analyzing and reprogramming the cutter's AI  to make amenable to our commands. In reviewing the ship's  configuration, I believe you can refit it for human  use or at least for human transport. It might  be worthwhile working on the gunner's position. I'm  not designed to full fill that function which is why I  wanted to stay away from any firefight."
  "I am not design to full fill that function,"  Major Patel repeated.
  "That is correct," I said. Her tone was  mocking, but I have learned that I can often disarm  humans verbally by taking their words at face value.  "I am a runner, designed to navigate and perform  helm functions. I know the rudiments of gunnery,  but those subroutines are strange and, well,  uncomfortable for me to interface with."
  "Captain Star Runner, Star, I think you should  know--" He trailed off, cleared his throat again and  went on, "we had losses, deaths, as a result  of our firefight with the Pantheran warships.the room  fell silent. Everyone looked at me. General  Paul Hanson cleared his throat again.  "Colonel Philip Drucker, Funji Man  and three marines died."
  I was dumbfounded.i had never considered the  possibility that Philip Drucker's silence or  his absence when I docked or in the conference was the  result of his being dead.
  "I am sorry for their loss," I said. There  seemed nothing else to say. Although losses had been  talked about, I had been far from the actual fighting,  buy learning a new ship, nearly immobilized by  its incredible speed and anxious to put as much distance as  possible between myself and the Pantheran warships as  possible. I had focused on the power blue  runner's death because it had been a runner like me. I  could not picture how these five deaths had occurred.
  Everyone continued to watch me. The Fungusian  reached out to me.
  "They are expecting you to be upset by Colonel  Drucker's death. I understand you were close," she  said.
  "We--"' I showed her images. I didn't  have any words. Philip Drucker and I spent time  together. We enjoyed each other's company. We had  sex together, more or less together. yet somehow it was  casual. In many ways, I realized, I was much  closer to Tamara.
  "The runner is processing what Colonel

Drucker's means to it," The Fungusian  said. "Bear in mind, Pantheran runners do not have  particularly strong bonds to other beings. They are so  deeply connected to their ships."
  There was murmuring, shuffling, looks in my  direction. I sensed they found me very alien at that  point. Humans can be very xenophobic at times.
  "My ship," I asked. "has it messaged  you?"'
  "We have an encrypted file," Admiral  Zelbouski got control of the meeting. "It was  marked for you only."
  "With an expiration date," I said. "You would  have been able to read the mesage if I either didn't  appear after a certain amount of time or you told  Ship you needed the information it had and it agreed. Station  Manager Prudence Wu knows this."
  "Ah, Prudence," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  said.
  He stood up.
  "Star, we're finished here for the moment. We'll  work with you about the ship's stores and disposition tomorrow. You  must be tired and have a lot to digest."
  Digest. What I was was hungry. I turned  to go and found Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski walking beside me  again. Was Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski my body  guard?
  When we were outside the conference room, he laid  his hand on my shoulder.
  "Is this okay?"' Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  asked.
  "Touching me?"' I asked.
  "Yes."

  "Humans do this for a variety of reasons.  State your reasons," I said. I didn't think  this was a usual gesture. Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  had a mate, a wife.
  "Prudence and Philip--"' he began.  "Station Manager Prudence Wu wished to have a  committed relationship with Philip Drucker," I  said.
  "You know about that,"'Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski said.  he seemed relieved.
  "Yes. My relationship with Philip Drucker  made her very angry with both of us," I said.
  "She's taking Phil's death very hard. Watch  yourself, Star. She may take it out on you. She  thinks you caused it somehow."
  "Me? Caused Philip Drucker's death?"'  "Of course you didn't," Admiral

Zelbouski hastened to assure me. "She just  needs someone to blame.."
  Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski patted my shoulder, his  fingers ruffling my fur. Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski  pulled his hand away quickly.the telltales were  slight, but I sensed more than knew that Admiral  Zelbouski had enjoyed touching me, more in the way  Tamara did than in the way Philip Drucker  had. These humans were very strange.
  I padded away, intent on a meal at the  Spyglass Cafe . Although it was sometimes necessary to know  everything there was to know about particular deaths, I  preferred to have Ship catalog this information and advise  me of what I needed to know when I needed to know it.
  "Of course," Tamara said. "I'll bring you  some food, too."
  "Thank you, Tamara," I said and went to a  table.
  Tamara quickly came with the milk and a large  chocolate chip cookie. Although humans have a  particular order to their food consumption, the order in  which a meal is eaten is unimportant to me. I  am just as happy to eat a cookie first as last. I  usually do both.
  Tamara served a marvelous gyro. She also  brought a plate of macaroni and cheese. Then  Tamara sat down at the table with me..
  "Are you okay?"' Tamara asked.
  "I am hungry," I said.
  "I mean, about Colonel Drucker,"  Tamara said.
  "I will miss Philip Drucker's company,"  I said.
  "Well, you don't seem, sad," Tamara  said.
  I continued to eat, thinking how to explain myself to  her. I realized all the humans, especially  Tamara and, for that matter, Station manager Prudence  Wu, would be expecting me to be distraught.  Certainly that was the prospect the people at the conference were  anticipating.
  "I liked Colonel Philip Drucker,"
I told Tamara. "We enjoyed each other's  company, but neither of us," I searched for the right words,  "neither of us thought our association would develop into  something other than it was. I'm a runner,  Tamara. I am biologically incapable of doing  specific biological acts or feeling  particular emotions which makes bonding possible."
  "So you don't care?"' Tamara challenged.  "That's not accurate," I said, munching  on a red onion. It tasted particularly good, its  juice tickling my whole mouth. "I am," I  searched for the right word to express what I was feeling.  It seemed very important to Tamara that she know how  I felt about Philip Drucker's death though why  this should be so I didn't know. "I am disappointed  that he is dead. I was looking forward to resuming our  relationship when I returned here to Pirate's  Cove."
  "But you're not even upset that he's dead,"  Tamara said indignantly "What kind of a person  are you, Star?"'
  "I am a Pantheran runner," I said very  quietly.
  Tamara had started to get up out of her chair to  make a big gesture. She sat down suddenly.
  "Are you saying you can't feel sad about  Colonel Drucker's death?"' Tamara asked just  as quietly.
  "I can feel sad about some things," I said. I  thought about the powder runner. I thought about Tamara  standing on the observation deck looking out into space in  the direction of Earth. "I don't feel sad about  this. I will miss Philip Drucker. I will miss  spending time with him and the way he treated me."
  "Star," Tamara said, "please don't think  I'm rude. I don't mean to be, but, can you  cry?"'
  "Yes, of course," I said.
  "When do you cry?"'
  I considered this. "When I'm badly hurt,"  I said.
  "Oh, yes, that, but, I mean, do you cry when  you're sad?"'
  I thought about how I felt when I went through the  powder blue runner's basket, when I found the  holo. I suddenly realized I needed to share this  Tamara, to help her understand. The communications I  had with Tamara were much deeper than those I had had with  Philip Drucker. I wondered if this was the  difference between friendship and sex.
  "I want to tell you a story," I said,  making up my mind to tell Tamara about the powder  blue runner. "It is a very sad story. Maybe  it will you understand me a little more and about being a runner.  Come to my ship when you get off work."
  Tamara agreed, puzzled and very, very excited about  being aboard the Pantheran ship and hearing me tell  her a story about myself and about runners.


* Chapter 23

Tamara did not get off work for several hours. Although I was looking for a nap after my large meal of human food, I needed to go to the station manager's office and retrieve my message from Ship. We had agreed before Operation Capture the Flagon this cumbersome setup. It ensured Ship would get an answer from someone at some point though I had disliked its intrusive and human-based-technological character from the beginning.

I entered the office. No one was present. I went to the computer with its keyboard. A message was on the monitor: "All flesh is like grass,  and all its glory is like the flower of the field." I pondered these words. They were quite strange. Grass is plant material. So are flowers. But flesh typically refers to animals. How are animals like plants. I sighed. This was, after all, a screen saver. Humans are fond of them. I'm told they once protected their monitors from damage but over time they had become a matter of personal expression. 

although I can use a human keyboard, typing the lengthy series of numbers requires more manual dexterity than I normally need. I was concentrating on my task when Station manager Prudence Wu burst into the office.

"Well, don't you have the nerve--" she began.

I mistyped and lost my place near the end of the string and had to hit reset.

Station Manager Prudence Wu continued: "It's all your fault, Star. If you hadn't had Philip wrapped around your little finger"

I pressed reset again. What was station Manager Prudence Wu saying. Properly speaking, I don't have fingers. I have toes with the opposed digits on my front paws which are necessary for manipulating tools. Humans call these digits thumbs.  Little finger: the one on the outside of each paw. How could I wrap someone around my outer most toe?

I decided not to answer her. The office was small. Station Manager Prudence Wu was standing in the doorway. I couldn't move past her and come back to the office at a later time to avoid this confrontation. Besides, I wanted the message from my Ship. Philip Drucker was dead. Regrettable, but that was what had happened and Station manager Prudence Wu's accusations, whatever they meant, wouldn't change that.

Fortunately, I think, Station Manager Prudence Wu's monolog which continued to rise in volume--"and ferocity as well as incoherence, drew a crowd. Two security officers arrive followed quickly by General Paul Hanson and later by Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski. 

"Come with me, Pru," General Paul Hanson said. "You're just upsetting yourself."

"Get that animal out of my office," Station Manager Prudence Wu demanded.

"Ma'am," one of the security officers began.

"Get that disgusting animal out of my office," Station Manager Prudence shrieked.

Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski pushed past Station Manager Prudence Wu into  the office. I had given up trying to enter my key.

"Captain Star Runner--"

"I'm trying to retrieve my ship's message," I said. "I cannot concentrate and use this keyboard under the current conditions. Nor can I leave the office."

"Let me help you," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski offered. "I know these keyboards are not designed for your hands."

"Paw," I corrected him.

"Ah, right, paws," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski said.

General Paul Hanson took Station Manager Prudence Wu's arm and, with the help of the security officers, led her away, dispersing the crowd.

"Sorry about Pru's behavior," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski said.

"You did not interrupt my input," I said. "Why are you apologizing?"

Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski turned to face me. "Captain Star Runner, I'll admit to you that I am not comfortable around aliens. I am not comfortable around you.I was not comfortable with your relationship with Phil. But you didn't cause Philip Drucker's death. You did what we asked you to do. You got the ship here. We need its databases. We need the hardware you told us is on board. We could use that ship to defend our territory. I don't have to like you to recognize that you have been a key factor in making the defense of the northern territories a credible option. I am confident we can continue to work together to carry out the FRONT's objectives. I don't understand you. I don't 
understand what makes you tick. It makes my skin crawl to think of genetic engineering or what you and Colonel Drucker may have done together. But that doesn't give me, or anyone else, the right to judge your relationship or blame you for his death. Pru Wu is out of line and I don't want her histrionics to endanger the protection of FRONT space. Do I make myself clear?"

"Yes," I said. "In my experience, your attitudes are consistent with most humans I have encountered."

"If you'll dictate the key, I'll enter it for you," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski said, turning abruptly back to the keyboard but not before I saw the reddening of his skin which indicates shame among humans. I realized Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski had spoken more candidly than he had intended.

I dictated the number and read Ship's message:

Arrived Dirty World Station (date and time stamp). Repairs initiated. Awaiting instructions.

"Do you want me to print that?"

"That is unnecessary. The information has been catalogued," I replied.

"How did you do that?"

"I read the message and transmitted everything to my ship's AI. It was quite unconscious on my part."

"So you store everything you see?"

"Not in the ship's databases unless I want to save it." I said. "Animal brains can store tremendous amounts of data as you know. Much of it is not necessary to retain in a ship databases."

I left the station manager's office and returned to my Ship. The scene in the office had been stressful. I had wanted to curl up in my basket, but Ship directed me to the acceleration web. Grudgingly, I strapped in. But, after a scan and a detoxification, Ship gave me a sleeping drug and sent me off to my basket. I groggily jumped in and had barely curled up when I was asleep. 

* Chapter 24
Unlike humans, The Race retains many  characteristics of our forebearers. One of these is instinct  wakefulness. I do not know this for a fact, but I've  always sensed that it is heightened in androgens.  Despite all of my genetic programming,  inherited and enhanced, I peeked over the top of my  basket groggily when Tamara called:  "Anybody home?" from the entrance to the  Hispaniola.
"Can you climb up?" I called.  "Sure thing."
The Hispaniola was configured to allow humans  to board via a ladder built into the entrance well.  I watched as she came into view. She, however, had  no idea where I was.
"Star?"
"Up here," I said, continuing to stay curled in my  basket.
She looked around.
"Look up.." I said.
When she did, she smiled. "You sleep in a  basket!" she cried.
"Yes," I said. "Can you climb up here?"  The climbing bars were widely spaced for her.  Later I would learn many humans fear such  climbs. Tamara, however, seemed to enjoy it and  plopped down next to my basket, swinging her legs  over the edge Mindful that it was a long way down,  I advised her to hold onto the side of my  basket while I had Ship readjust the gravity  so Tamara would only float off her perch and not  injure herself if she should fall.
"You look so cute, all curled up," Tamara  said. "I just want to pet and pet you."
Tamara reached out a hand and touched my head,  scratching behind my left ear. It felt good. I  began to purr.
"You purr!" Tamara exclaimed.
"Of course," I said and resumed purring.  "But it's so loud," Tamara giggled.
"Loud?"
"Well, you're much bigger than a house cat."  I turned my head and her hand fell away.
"I'm sorry," Tamara said. "I didn't  mean to offend you."
"I'm not a pet," I said, feeling both  indignant and wistful that I had to interrupt her  scratching. HAVING Tamara stroke me sounded quite  pleasant.



  "You wanted to show me something?" Tamara  asked, mercifully changing the subject.
  "Yes," I said, reaching for the personals box just  behind the basket. I withdrew the holo of the powder  blue runner. I handed it to her.
  Tamara studied it for some time.
  "This is a kitten," Tamara finally said.  "Yes," I said.
  "And you're the older kitten carrying it, aren't  you?"
  "Yes. We usually call them juveniles."  "And who is the kitten?"
  "I don't remember its number," I said.  "It's in the ship's records. I think of it as the  powder blue runner. It was this ship's runner when it  was captured by the Operation."
  "What happened to it?" Tamara asked, sensing there  would be a story.
  "It's captain euthanized it," I said. "Its  death was painless and quick. The runner was an addict, very  thin, very mangy and very near the end of its life. It  was, used up."
  Tamara turned the holo over and over in her  hands, looking at it, silent.
  "That sounds horrible."
  "It looked very ill," I said. "I saw  its body."
  "I meant, killing it."
  "It was kinder to dispatch it quickly and not have it go into  withdrawal and die on the life boat," I said.
  "You sound so matter-of-fact about it," Tamara  challenged.
  "Yes. Addiction is well-known among  runners."
  "And you?"
  "No, I have a good AI. Ship only gives  me what I need to do the job."
  "And why didn't Baby Blue's AI do this  same?"
  "because," I said, "the drugs and the ride is quite a  rush." I paused, considering her question. "We're  made to love the feel of being one with our ships. We  are the ship when we're underway. We're totally  plugged in--physically, mentally, emotionally. When  we're not cruising, we need to find other things to  keep us occupied. We're taught to have hobbies,  to pursue outside interests, but many of us succumb  to wanting to stay in rush mode so we use the recreational  drugs. No one else much cares. If we're  quiet and don't get in the way. When we're used  up, there's another runner to take our place.  We're pretty interchangeable as far as the rest of the  crew is concerned. The demands of piloting a  ship on our bodies and our minds means most of us  will be used up before we pay off our societal  debt."
  "Your societal debt?"
  "We don't have parents," I said. "Society  pays for all our education and care until we can join  the work force."
  "So you're made to run the ships and no one cares  about your lives?" Tamara demanded.
  "Basically, yes," I said. "We're bred to  fill a purpose. If we do that, pay our debt  and take care of ourselves, we may have some time for ourselves  afterwards"
  "And what about you?" Tamara demanded. "You're clearly older than this runner," she tapped the holo."My situation is different," I said.
  "How?"
  I sighed. "I was declared surplus That means they  couldn't, wouldn't, use me as a runner. I'm  too--independent-minded. I could have voluntarily  surrendered to be terminated. I will be forceably  terminated now if the Coalition lays hand on me.  I chose to go out on my own. Fending for yourself is an  alternative to termination."
  "That sounds terrible." Tamara was in sensed  "More of us are bred than is needed. The surplus  could be a drag on society if we cannot fend for  ourselves. Many can't. It's because our training is so  focused. There's a lot to learn in a very short  space of time."
  "They treat you like machines."
  "In many ways, we are machines," i said.  "You're not a machine," Tamara declared. "You're  my friend." And she put her arms around my neck and  buried her face against my breast bone. I  realized she was crying. I sat very still. i didn't  know what to do. I wondered if I should pet her.
  "So you see," I said, when Tamara had resumed  her seat on the shelf and let go of me, "death is a  given in my reality. There's mostly work. Since  I've come to Pirate's Cove, I've learned  there are other things to life."
"Like Colonel Drucker," Tamara said. I tried to understand her tone. Human emotions were still very strange to me.
"Like Colonel Drucker," I agreed tentatively. "And you."
"Me?" Tamara was very surprised.
"Yes. I enjoy your companionship," I said.
"Star," Tamara said, "I am going to make  sure you don't end up like this runner." She tapped  the holo. "That's what friends do for each other."
  "And what about you?" I asked.
  "You take care of me," Tamara said, puzzled.  "You always take me seriously and you listen very  carefully to me. You invited me onto your  ship. You showed me this holo. You even let me  pet you, a little. I bet you don't do that for many other  humans."
  "No," I said. "I don't. I've never had a  friend so you'll have to teach me how to be one."
  "I will," Tamara promised. "But now I have  to go. I have some homework to finish for tomorrow."
  "Okay," I said. "I'll see you in the  cafe." Tamara reached out for a horizontal bar,  missed, floated, kicked in the air, grabbed it and  made her way out of the Hispaniola

 
* Chapter 25

The meetings seemed endless. All I wanted was to be paid and to get to Dirty World Station to get my ship. But the rangling went on and on. Worst of all, the meetings kept being highjacked by Free Residents of the Northern Territory business. I wasn't a member of Free Residents of the Northern Territories--the humans called it FRONT--and I didn't want to be a member. I just wanted to get on with my business. The problem of how I was going to get to Dirty World Station remained unresolved.

I was sitting up at the conference table--the human chairs had long ago become too uncomfortable--when Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy everyone else does) Zelbouski said, "Our next agenda item is the databases aboard the Hispaniola." By now, everyone was calling the Coalition cutter that. He consulted his inventory.

I tensed. There were databases I wanted. There were databases I simply wanted a copy of and databases I wanted exclusive rightw to. Being paid in information was one of our pre-raid-agreed-upon terms for my expertise.

"The runner and I can start immediately to convert the necessary databases into a form readable by your ships," FunjiWoman said. The humans still called the Fungusian FunjiMan. The Fungusians touched my mind as female but I had learned they are an assexual race having no real understanding of sexuality. My understanding is limited but I exploit it whenever possible for business reasons.

"How long will that take?" major Andre Anon asked. Major Andre Anon was the intelligence officer for the Free Residents of the Northern Territories.

"That depends on the speed of your computers," FunjiWoman said. "The runner and I can work faster with our machines than your machines can process."

"How is that possible?" General Paul Hansen demanded. "You don't have state of the art computing power."

"Our races have enhanced the," Funji Woman hesitated, searching for the right word, "the sentient being interface. The runner is designed to interface with the artificial intelligence controlling the ship's databases. I am also able to interface more directly with my systems. Since your systems are less," again FunjiWoman searched for a term, a tactgful term I was given to understand by the Fungusians noninvasive telepathic link with me, "     "interface-friendly," FunjiWoman continued, "we will have to build the necessary bridges to transfer the information."

"And how long is that going to take?" Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy everyone else does) Zelbouski inquired.

FunjiWoman and I conferred. Caculations flashed in my brain. Strapped into my acceleration web so that Ship could monitor and manage my motabulism, streaming data and brain capacity, mental rest cycles, physical fatigue, stimulants, risk factors---Ship was making sure none of this work put me at any risk--all this went into the calculation with FunjiWoman receiving the final output, supplying her own parameters and an initial estimate of the amount of work to be done and adding a significant overrun factor, the Fungusian said after only a moment's hesitation, "About five days working around the clock. Of course, you will not have access to either of us or our ships during that time."

"You'll be working for five ship days sstraight?" One of the junior officers said in surprise.

"Yes," FunjiWoman said. "My race can be wakeful for long periods of time. The runner's ship can manage the runner's biological needs in full so that, for all intents and purposes, the runner will be able to sustain wakefulness and alertness. Of course, after the conversion, we will both need undisturbed rest." Again calculations ran. The data was analized. "After a rest period of 3 station days, we can then return to the station. By then, you will be able to give us a report on your satisfaction with the data."

"So if you started now," Major Andre Anon looked at his calendar.

"Oh, no," FunjiWoman said quickly. "We cannot begin today. We will need to prepare" Consultation. "We will begin at ten hundred hours tomorrow."

"Very well," General Paul Hanson said. 

And the meeting was finally over.

I had to prepare for this intesive effort. Exercise. Food. Sleep. I let Ship direct me from cafe, to track, to the climbing bars aboard the Hispaniola to dream enhanced sleep. REM sleep was incredibly important. Then I was ready to be strapped into the acceleration web, to feel the stimulants flow into my system, to have the sexual fantasy play through my mind to relax and position me comfortably in the web. The fantasy was very intense, teatering on the edge of pain and pleasure. I both felt the barbed penis penetrate my vaginaenetrated the other's vagina. Barbs held firm into flesh. My joint partners raked me with their claws. I dug my own into pastel flanks. My teeth sunk into soft flesh at the collar bone. I felt teeth in the back of my neck. My orgasm seemed ripped out of me, prolonged, intensified. The analitical part of my brain, seemingly very far away, knew both the stimulants in my system and the brain maniupulation necessary for me to have this experience, both contributed to the length of the climax. Damn! These programs were good. I never had the sens  of computer overlay. The integration was seamless. I had a penis. I could feel my partners' bodies, smell them, taste them. I both felt my prick harden and afterwards go limp. I felt the other's prick inside my own vagina, felt my breast tips harden. Felt tongue and teeth touch and nip. Sauealed. yowled. Collapsed momentarily exhausted. Moved to that place of post coiordal oblivion, returned satisfied, content, felt the surge of chemicals coming into me and being sept away. And then I was on, fully on, and delving deep into the business of working with the ship and with FunjiWoman.

The databases were a bitch to convert. The human archecture was limited, dependen on an brain comprehension and structures and an inherent distrust of artificial intelligence that did not presume to be superior to the human ability to control and direct. Our first few hours of work was learning what the station computers would and would not accept. Once we knew the physical limitations of the system, its security and format, the conversions could be developed, run, verified. We kept our work cut off from the working station, unaccessible to all except ourselves. 

From time to time I felt Ship come into me, rearrange memory, massage limbs, spine, chest. I was nourished. i eliminated. parts of me were shut down\ for rest, revived. I kept working, vaguely aware that, when it was all over, when I awoke as if from a deep sleep, I would be subtly altered. I would know things I hadn't known before. I would recall things quicker. The deep scan of my brain and its reorganization under the control of the cutter's AI was more rigorous than any degragmentation I had had since my days at the Institute. I would be mentally stronger, and, (and this thought was fleeting since I couldn't devote any time to it), tougher. A part of the no-nonsense, all for the cause programming of the Hispanola's AI would give me that. Tamara might find my fur soft, my pur comforting, but underneath it all, I would have moved a little bit closer to my full potential as a runner.

* Chapter 26
  I came to consciousness very slowly, almost painfully. I am not accustomed to waking up by myself. Paired with the ship's AI, I am wakened to make decisions, to keep appointments, to run ship business. Being a creature that has lived its whole life in space, waking up this way feels so unnatural. I dislike it very much. However, sleeping until the body awakens itself is the protocol after the kind of intensive connection to ship databases I had just undergone. I was groggy, stiff, hungry and I needed to use the litter pan badly. Since I was connected via the acceleration web to the Ship, I found this state of affairs unsettling and intolerable. 

Floating free of my restraints, I began setting things right. A mouthful of crunchies convinced me I needed to do a quick grooming and get myself to the Spyglass Café as soon as possible. The humans could wait for FunjiWoman and me to look over their laundry list of concerns and see what we could do to fix any problems.

Tamara wanted to chat. I needed to eat. I ate all the specials the cafeé had on the menu that day and several servings of rice pudding and milk. 

Then, still not satisfied but knowing I needed exercise, I went to the uppermost level of the station where a running track ran like a balcony all around the inner well. Loping along, my legs stretched, my spine became more limber. I increased my pace and for a time, I was an animal of the savanna as my ancestors had been many tens of thousands of years ago. The only thing that stopped me was the station's air supply. Humans can function normally with less oxygen than I need to run for distance.

When I returned to the main level, a throng met me and cheered. They had been watching.

"You were fantastic," Tamara enthused.

I trotted next to her, returning to the Spyglass Cafe. For more nourishment. I could talk with her now.

"You should be an athlete!"Tamara proclaimed.

"Impossible." I said with my mouth full.

"Why?" Tamara was surprised.

"Because I'm not an athlete," I said. "I'm a runner."

"Do you know how funny that sounds?" Tamara teased. "I'm not an athlete. I'm a runner."

"Okay," I said, "a star runner.

"In your language, I see the humor, 

"In my language, running, as you call it, is something else, not running."

"What?" Tamara asked excitedly.

"Hunting," I said.

"But hunting could mean a lot of different activities," Tamara said.

"Then it wouldn't be hunting," I said, "it would be pouncing or stalking or something else."

"Oh," Tamara sounded disappointed."Then do athletes hunt?" 

"No one hunts anymore," I said wistfully. "There are no hunting grounds left on Mother World."

"Mother World?" Tamara prompted.

"Panthera," I said. "It's the Mother's World."

"The mother?" Tamara asked. "Who's the mother?"

"The mother of us all," I responded, knowing this answer would not satisfy Tamara and also knowing I was quickly moving into a subject area I both felt uncomfortable discussing with a human and with which I had little expertise or facility.

"The Mother of us all?" Tamara asked, emphasizing us.

"Well, maybe, just us," I stammered, "The Race."

Tamara stared at me. "You don't all have one mother," Tamara finally said.

"No, of course not," I replied. This was getting very complicated. "Our mother--her constellation--it's in our sky."

"You believe in a heavenly mother?" Tamara asked, "and she's a constellation of stars?"

"No, no!" I exclaimed. "Of course not. That would be, primitive. Maybe once upon a time we believed that. You can see her tail, her feet, the arch of her back, her ears and the tip of her nose--" 

Tamara was staring at me. 

"From the Mother's World, of course," I added, feeling quite foolish.

"And you worship the Mother of Us All?" Tamara asked. "You have myths about some wonderful Panthera at the beginning."

I considered how to answer Tamara. Something told me that humans did something of this sort or had one time or another. I was not proficient in cross species anthropology and cultures. 

"Not worship," I finally said. "The Mother is present. We can be reminded of that by looking at the stars--if we're in any of the systems making up the constellation or can see any part of it from the worlds where The Race has settled--The Race has only settled on worlds from which the Mother can be seen or imagined.  She is our guardian, our protector, like a mother protecting and caring for her kittens. She is part of the greater universe. It is the power there we worship because there is a power beyond all that we know or can understand in the universe."

I had exhausted almost all of my ability to converse on this topic. We had been told as kittens to rely on our Mother's protection. This is especially important for androgens that do not grow up in a family environment. We are to respect the power of the universe, especially those of us who venture into space or do other dangerous tasks and most androgens do. WE were taught some of the ancient stories. We were encouraged to learn the others and memorize the ballads of old. We had much else to learn and what Tamara was asking seemed very esoteric and only for those with nothing else to do.
 
Tamara kept staring at me. I decided it was time to talk about something else. I couldn't think of anything though. I thought about just getting up and leaving the Spyglass Cafe. I wondered if humans did that. I wondered why it mattered to me. I wasn't human and I didn't want to be. I was proud of being a member of The Race. I am, after all, a fuchsia-colored Pantheran and they are indeed very special. I knew that about myself though what the Mother of Us All had in store for me as a Savior of my race I had no idea. I decided right then it would not be a good idea to share any of this with Tamara. Her theological bent had implications for our conversation I wasn't prepared to consider. The Mother took care of The Race and that was sufficient for me.

"You're not at all religious are you?" Tamara finally said.

"I am a runner," I said. "I was taught the basics and to trust the Mother of Us All to protect and guard me. What else is there to know or to think about?"

"You keep saying that,'I'm a runner,' as if that explains everything."

"Doesn't it?" I asked. "It says most everything about me."

"I don't understand," Tamara said.

"I was bred to be a runner. I was raised to be a runner. I was educated and trained to be a runner. Although I am not a runner for business or for the military for The Race, I am still a runner. What else could I be?"

"Anything you wanted to be!" Tamara exclaimed.

"No," I said. "I'm not trained. My mind is linked to the Ship. I couldn't be, say, a farmer on Treasure Island. I don't know anything about farming and I wouldn't have the Ship in my head to look after me. So how could I be a farmer?"

"Are you saying that you are physically unable to be apart from your ship?" Tamara asked.

"No," I said. "Surplus runners who aren't terminated and who don't function as runners have to get along without ships. It's just very hard and lonely. They get sick. They can't perform at their peak performance. And they're not doing what they're bred for."

"You keep saying that, what I'm bred for," Tamara said.

"Because I am bred for a specific task. My genetic profile is designed for me to be a runner and nothing else. That's why I was born. That's why runners who are deemed surplus actually voluntarily go to be terminated. They don't want to live if they're not runners. It would be too hard to be anything else and there are no opportunities for them to be anything else that's worthwhile."

"So you couldn't be an athlete?" Tamara asked.

"Absolutely not," I said. 

"Why?" Tamara asked.

"Because I'm an androgen," I said. "You have to be sexed. You train your whole life to be an athlete. You breed to produce better athletes."

"It's like a cast system," Tamara declared.

I considered this, checking with the ship's database. 

"No," I said. "Cast systems on Earth are hereditary and all the people are genetically similar. I am physically very different from an athlete."

Tamara sighed. "Have it your way, but I think it's awful that you can't determine what you want to be when you grow up," she said.

"And what do you want to be when you grow up" I asked, knowing that Tamara was almost an adult but not quite and what that not quite was I didn't understand. .

Tamara looked down at her hands and fidgeted. I had raised an uncomfortable topic for her.

"I don't know," she finally said. "I have no money and not a lot of education. I can't get off this station and the only work I can do is be here at the cafe."

"So you are like me," I said.

"No," Tamara said, a bit angrily I thought. "You have a ship and can leave any time you want."

"No, I don't," I said. "My ship is at Dirty World Station waiting for parts. I'm stuck here on Pirate's Cove until I can figure out how to get to Dirty World Station to fetch my ship and get back to making money. I'll have a lot of work to do just to re-establish my customer base. This taking of the Hispaniola has been more involved than I thought it would be."

"So we're both stuck here," Tamara said quietly.

I sensed more than could reason for my belief that Tamara was offering me a way out of our difficult conversation with all its possibilities for misunderstanding. Tamara was trying to say we were alike when clearly we were very, very different. I thought it might have something to do with friendship.

"Yes," I said though I wasn't sure to what I was agreeing. 
* Chapter 27

"There you are!" Station Manager Prudence Wu said, sweeping into the Spyglass Café. "Captain Star Runner, we've been looking all over for you. You're needed in the conference room. We need to talk to you about the databases."

Her preemptory tone displeased me. I felt my back arch. I wanted to hiss and spit at Station Manager Prudence Wu. I had worked for five days straight on the human databases, depleting my body and my mental capacities to dangerous levels. I had just awoken and was putting myself to rights.

I spoke to her in hisses, "Your database conversion was quite difficult. I hope you appreciate the effort it took both me and FunjiWoman to make the data accessible to you. I am just recovered enough to eat my first meal in eight days."

Station Manager Prudence Wu stepped back two steps. "I--I didn't mean--we really need your help."

"What seems to be the problem?" I asked, only hissing on the word 'problem'.

"We can access the data just fine," Station Manager Prudence Wu. "We just don't understand it. We thought you might be able to shed some light on what is in there."

"Very well," I said, deliberately beginning to wash my face. "I will be there shortly."

Recognizing that she was being dismissed, Station Manager Prudence Wu wisely left the Spyglass Café.

"You are quite fierce when you talk like that," Tamara observed.

"I can be a lot more intimidating when I want to be," I said, "or need to be. Satisfied with my face washing and giving my whiskers one more rub, I added, "I hope to talk with you more later. I don't know how long I will be with the Free Residents of the Northern Territories. I think I will be some time. If it is not too late, may I come to your room?"

"Please."

And I left the Spyglass Cafe., walking slowly, stretching my legs, my neck, my back, and especially my tail.

"What can I help you with?" I asked, hunkering down at the end of the table. "Station Manager Prudence Wu indicates that there is data you do not understand."

"We believed," Admiral Theodore call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbousky began, "that the databases on the Coalition cutter would provide us with tactical I'm
Information that could prepare FRONT for any military contingency. We don't find this information in the records you and the Fungusian have provided."

"A Coalition cutter would not have such information in its databases," I replied.

"But you and that other Fungusian said that there would be large amounts of key military data aboard ship," Admiral Theodore call me Teddy, everybody else Zelbouski insisted.

"And there is," I replied. "You have to read dispatches, sift through schematics, standing orders, squadron formations. It's a painstaking task."

"But I thought," Admiral Theodore call me Teddy, everybody else does) Zelbouski began.

"The correlation of data," I interrupted, "was to have been handled by Colonel Philip Drucker and his people."

There was silence all around the table.

"Is there anything you can do to help?" General Paul Hanson asked me directly.

I was silent. For the right price, I could do many things. But after the conversation I just had with Tamara, I was beginning to wonder if my time spent here on Pirate's Cove was being well spent. The longer I stayed, the more identified with the Free Residents of the Northern Territories I became. There was the question about my ship at Dirty World Station. There was the question about the rest of my business.

"I have other business matters that require my attention at this time," I informed General Paul Hanson. "I we could come to an accommodation, I might be able to assist you more. I consider our original business arrangement to be nearly at an end."

"You can't leave--" Major Andre Anon started to object.

"Yes I can and yes I will," I said firmly, "Unless we can come to an understanding. I need my ship--the one at Dirty World Station. I need to get the information you agreed to give me off the Hispaniola and into my Ship's databases. I need to resume my procurement business. If I am further delayed here, I need to be compensated and I need to find a way to continue my other business interests this far from normal shipping lanes."

I didn't usually give this much away but I was beginning to learn that these people responded reasonably if they were well-acquainted with my circumstances. They didn't understand my needs. They didn't understand my business and my dependence on my Ship.

"So you need your ship," General Paul Hanson said. "How can we facilitate that?"

"Some Pantheran circuitry was damaged in the raid," I explained. "I am having the part shipped from Barter's Planet. Because Dirty World Station is so far out from the outworlds, it's taking longer than usual though I requested an expedited delivery schedule. It is currently difficult to secure a dedicated courier. With the loses in the Bermuda Triangle ..." I didn't have to explain that to these people. "When the ship is repaired, I can bring it back here. However, I need to get to Dirty World Station."

"Can’t the Ship fly itself here?" Station Manager Prudence Wu asked. "It got itself to Dirty World Station."

"That took a lot of pre-programming on my part," I explained. "My ship has artificial intelligence, but it is designed to work in close concert with a runner. Without a runner giving constant feedback and direction, the AI can become disoriented and get off track. It can chase its own tail, so to speak."

"Can we bring the ship here for you?" the lieutenant asked.

I considered this.

"You can fly the ship directly," I said. "But if you escorted it ..." I checked in with the Hispaniola, presenting the possibility of a piloted ship acting as escort, solving problems and simply asking my ship to stay close.

"Yes, that would work," I said. "I could send my ship a message asking it to accept your commands via a voice link, secured, of course. I could write the passkey protocols for you."

"Then that's what will do," General Paul Hanson decided. "Captain Star Runner, please advise us when we can dispatch a courier to pick your ship up."

"Now, to our databases."

* Chapter 28

I began to appreciate the memory realignment process as I went into the databases to begin to develop the access routines which would enable the humans to organize the military data. I knew things I had never learned, understood things I had only had a passing knowledge of and I sensed, rather than knew, that other information had been kept but relegated to a less conscious status. My relationship with Colonel Philip Drucker, for example, was only a fact. It had no emotional hold over me as the life and death of the powder blue runner. I worked quickly, easily and with great confidence. I realized that my tendency now to hiss was part of my rearranged persona. I decided a more aggressive attitude so far as the Free Residents of the Northern Territories people were concerned was not a bad thing. They were making great demands on my time and resources. I could be much pricklier than I had been. I further realized that it was my relationships with some of them, Colonel Philip Drucker in particular and to a lesser extent Tamara's relationship with Station Manager Prudence Wu that had caused me to be more amenable to their wants and desires. I would continue to be agreeable until I had the databases aboard my little ship and I was ensconsed there. I was really looking forward to that. The courier had been sent and I hoped to be aboard my own little ship soon. 

"Look at this," FunjiWoman said. The thought coalesced in my mind, the Captain Star Runner always politely implied and inferred. "What do you make of this?"

"These are the name of ships," I said, looking at one column of names. I recognize them. Here's my little ship. Here are the captains' names. Next to my ship is my Pantheran identification number--better than names. The number is unique."

"And the other information?" FunjiWoman persisted.

"Must be cargos," I murmured in my mind, letting FunjiWoman into my mental stream. "Or at least, some educated guesses as to our cargos ... And where we got them and where they are going and who paid for them. There's an analysis attached to this data. Let's see what they think this all means?"

Later we would read the report very, very carefully. Later still the War Room, as they called it, would be covered in charts and three-dimensional representations of space would be projected into the room and there would be much discussion, but immediately FunjiWoman and I grasped the import of the plot we saw. The Coalition had a working document of where all the munitions had gone, who had bought them, who had supplied them and where they had come from both geographically and business wise. The results of their intelligence and projections, with a healthy dose of guesswork I presumed, were startling.

The bulk of armaments I and others had been transporting across the border or picking up from those who had smuggled it across were going to the so-called private worlds: the Duke of Fie, Queensland and the loosely confederated worlds collectively known as the Republic of Space. FRONT was not on any list. Curiously, the Consortium with all their business acumen had little armaments. 

"The Duke of Fie," I said, "has the reputation of liking military toys."

"And the Queen is paranoid," FunjiWoman observed.

"That leaves the Republic of Space," I mused. "I wonder what they're up to."

"Hard to say," FunjiWoman said. "It's hard to get in there if you're not one of them."

"This could explain," I began, then stopped.

"Captain Gillian Romeres Lujo interest in your business," FunjiWoman finished. "The Consortium wants to know what the privates are up to. Despite his predilection for militarism and the queen's paranoia, they both like to hold sway over their parts of space and the Republic ... Well; it's only a republic in name and not in action. It has delusions of empire."

"The Race," I began, and then stopped putting what I wanted to say into words. I simply pictured some key events in our history for FunjiWoman to absorb.

"Panthera is an old empire," FunjiWoman commented. "The Coalition is a thinly veiled attempt to convince the humans that they are not under its thumb."

"And the Fungusians?" I asked.

"The Pantheran Empire rules the southern frontier quite thoroughly. It is your race's conviction that they are superior which allows us to work under the radar, so to speak. You as a runner are very sensitive to our telepathy and have a remarkable gift to both connect to it and to block it. I suspect that is quite unconscious on your part. Your mind is," and here the Fungusian paused for what was a long time but would, if spoken out loud only be a fractional hesitation, "different from any other Pantheran I have known."

"Oh," I said, and mentally erected stop signs. My nose quivered and my tail twitched. I knew the answer. The only explanation for an engineered member of The Race to be this way was that I am a fuchsia-colored Pantheran. It was an accident of my genetic make-up but a useful asset to cultivate. I held myself quiet and FunjiWoman changed the subject.

"And in the middle of it al," I said, "We have the Bermuda Triangle."

"And an interdiction that isn't working here," FunjiWoman contributed.

"Because the Coalition is letting the goods through?" I asked, considering. "They know who's transporting everything. They know what it is. They know where it's come from and where its going is."

"And the FRONT is the wild card in all of this," FunjiWoman said. "They haven't planned on these folk out here wanting to absent themselves from the Coalition."

"Can they?" I asked.

"Don't be naïve, Captain Star Runner," FunjiWoman retorted, "Of ours they can. The Pantheran Empire has been in decline for a thousand years. It's probably the northern territories that will finish it off."

This angered me.

"Don't get all hot," FunjiWoman broke into what I was going to shoot at her. "You've had a good run and even as an empire has been the Panthera are the only ones in this part of the galaxy with any sense."

     @2All FunjiWoman was saying was making my head hurt. Runners aren't educated to understand the depth and breath of political science or military strategies. We pilot spaceships. That I had been able to run a business from my ship was exceptional.

"So how" I asked, "does the Republic of Space hope to confront Panthera?" I asked.

"Oh, they won't invade Coalition space or anything like that, at least not for a while," The Fungusian responded. "But I think they will keep the Coalition out of the northern territories which is why FRONT will be their ally."

"Their ally!" the people around the conference table were incensed, "but FunjiWoman considered her presentation after we had emerged from being fully engaged with the databases.”Yes, you, the Republic of Space, the Duke of Fie and Queensland all have a common goal--to keep the Coalition and its Pantheran-based military out."

Everyone looked at me.

"Remember," I said, "I am both surplus and a meddler. Meddler is a technical term for an androgen whose," I searched for the right explanation, "whose engineered potential is being directed against the interests of The Race. As such, I'm blacklisted and to be terminated on sight."

"Let's be clear by what you mean by terminated," Admiral Theodore (call me Teddy everybody else does Zelbousky stated.

"Killed," I said. "At this point it would be with dignity and respect. I would jest be gunned down and left to rot."

My description was more colorful than accurate. It was what we were told at the Institute. The flare of language was to impress upon us that our lives meant nothing when we were so categorized. There were no explanations to be given, no excuses made, no extenuating circumstances. We would just be eliminated because we were dangerous or simply inconvenient. Our lives were of no concern to The Race. We had been made. We could equally be destroyed. I doubted anyone in the room understood how little our individual lives mattered. We had simply become thinking machines that had malfunctioned and it would be too costly to fix us.

"Is there any way to insure that," Station Manager Prudence Wu pointed at me,” thing isn't a spy?"

"It's not," FunjiWoman said matter-of-factly. "I've been in its mind. What it has told you is the truth. Its life is forfeit if anyone of the Coalition gets a hold of it. There's probably a bounty on its head after the raid. It would be skinned and its hide brought in for payment. Very dramatic but also very effective to convince other androgens not to go the way of Captain Star Runner."

I shivered. The Fungusian had gotten that image from somewhere deep in my mind. We had been told that, too, though I had never seen it, that particularly dangerous androgens were treated that way. The thought of my rich coat hanging in the entranceway of the Institute turned my stomach. I felt very queasy. I wondered if I'd be stuffed. "Be good little runners or you're end up like it," the uperclassers would say to the very impressionable juveniles. "That runner got above its station, thought it could act like a sexed Pantheran and looked what happened to it."

I was so very cold.

And then FunjiWoman did something totally unexpected. She gave me a telepathic scratch behind the ears.

 
* Chapter 29

It was here! It was here! My little ship was here! It would take FunjiWoman some time to to transfer everything from the Hispaniola to my little ship and remove all traces of me and my AI from the Hispaniola, but at least I could physically move from one ship to the other. The patches were made so I could function there and I curled up in my very own basket and just laid there, purring contentedly to myself for some time. It was very good to be home!

As soon as I was disconnected from the Hispaniola, I wanted to leave Pirate's Cove and get back to the InnerWorlds.

With the data and the munitions the Free Residents of the Northern Frontier had acquired from the Hispaniola, they were kept quite busy. The work FunjiWoman and I had done made it possible for them to access all the data and our services were no longer needed. FunjiWoman had left the Pirate's Cove for an unknown destination. Although I didn't know a lot about the Fungusians, I knew I would never see this particular Fungusian again. How much of our joint telepathic link would be part of the group consciousness I did not know. If I were to connect another Fungusian I supposed I would find out but I didn't think that would happen any time soon. Word, even this far from the border, was that the patrol perimeter had been tightened and the patrol ships put on high alert for another raid such as ours.

I began to consider my next course of action. The pornographic databases I had taken off the Hispaniola and uploaded to my network were bringing good revenue but I suspected that stream would not yield similar high results over the long term. Androgens and humans, for that matter, were always looking for new thrills. For some reason, after the defragmentation, those particular programs had had less appeal for me. I concluded that the Hispaniola's AI had had something to do with that. It was a disposition I decided not to remove or fight. Those programs simply were not aboard my little ship. 

There was money to be made and relationships to re-establish and I was anxious to be on my way. 

That left Tamara. She had been quite moody of late and I had finally figured out it was because she knew I was leaving and being with me troubled her. It was as if she was mourning my absence before it occurred. This puzzled me. Androgens are, after all, those who live in real time, letting their ships' manage their fantasy life.

Weighing the pros and cons of a situation and projecting its outcome is not something which comes naturally to me. I am a runner. I'm given a course. I lay it in to the ship's helm. I pilot the ship. I get it to where it is going. I interface with the ship, its systems, its energy levels, its speed, its relationship to the space around it. I am the one who processes jump space and makes sure the ship and its crew get from here to there Other kinds of contingencies are not part of my training, my genetic encoding, my disposition. So deciding what I was going to say to Tamara proved to be very difficult and took me much longer than I had anticipated. It came with a high emotional price tag, too.

I found myself on the observation deck, staring out to space. I could have done this while aboard ship. I would have simply let Ship put the view in my head. But somehow, I needed to use my eyes and press my nose and whiskers against the viewport. Station Manager Prudence Wu found me there.

"Captain Star Runner," Station Manager Prudence Wu exclaimed. "I didn't expect to find you here. I didn't think you cared much for just staring off into space."

"I'm finding it helps me think about things which I am unaccustomed to considering," I said. I don’t know why I engaged Station Manager Prudence Wu in conversation. We were uneasy in each other's presence.

"Teddy that would be Admiral Theodore call me Teddy everybody else does) Zelbousky) tells me you will be leaving Pirate's Cove soon."

"Yes," I said. "I think I have concluded my business here."

"We had thought you might stay and join the FRONT," Station Manager Prudence Wu commented.

I assumed "we" meant the other members of the Free Residents of the Northern Frontier. I didn't respond.

"Tamara is very upset that you are leaving," Station Manager Prudence Wu continued after realizing I wasn't going to say any more.

"Yes," I agreed. I continued to look out the viewport and not at Station Manager Prudence Wu.

"She is quite fond of you," Station Manager Prudence Wu added.

"And I of her," I said. "She is ... My friend. I've never had a friend before."

"How do you know what a friend is?" Station Manager Prudence Wu and I could hear the old acerbic tone creep into her voice.

"I can't," I said, "but Tamara was teaching me--at least a little."

"You are truly sad about leaving her." Station Manager Prudence Wu was surprised.

"Is that what I'm feeling?" I asked. "Emotions like this are quite new to me."

"What in the world do they do to you?" Station Manager Prudence Wu cried. "I am getting the feeling you are made in a test tube and just grown until they strap you into your spaceship."

"The embryo that became me was fertilized outside my mother's body in a lab," I told her. "I was raised at the institute and taught what I needed to know to be a runner and then I was sent out into space."

"They treat you like machines, like you are some sort of robot. It's inhuman!"

"Technically speaking, I'm not human, but if you mean that we are not treated like sexed citizens, you are right. We don't have the rights of a citizen. We are a lesser class."

"I would think you would want to fight for full citizenship," Station Manager Prudence Wu declared, a challenge in her voice. If you really are the runner you think you are, you would sand up for yourself.

"To what end?" I asked. "WE don't have the longevity of the sexed citizens. WE have no hereditary wealth. We cannot reproduce ourselves. Our genetic make-up is not random but tightly regulated and manufactured."

I would have expected Station Manager Prudence Wu to jump on the sentient machine analogy some humans have erroneously constructed to describe androgens. The Race knows the difference between sentient machines and androgens. We are quite different, as different as I am from my little ship's AI.

Instead she said, "Did you say 'not live as long'?" Her tone was tentative, questioning, not sure if she wanted an answer, afraid what I might say or do.

"Yes, I did," I said. "And before you as, I don't know how long I will live. My work allows me to have periods of rest. The time I have spent on Pirate's Cove not strapped into my acceleration web, not running a ship from here to there have prolonged my life. My little ship's AI is programmed to minutely review my biological requirement and make mini adjustments. That prolongs life, too. What no one knows is the effect on my brain, what new pathways can be made, how the defragmentation I underwent while converting your databases will enhance or detract from my mental processes over time. How doing new things and being in new places will impact my well-being. How worrying about Tamara and her well-being will affect me," I concluded, bringing us away from me and back to our mutual although markedly different concerns for Tamara’s happiness.

"Tamara thinks you will never come back to Pirate's Cove, that I especially will not want you to," Station Manager Prudence Wu told me. "Is that true?"

I knew from my study of humans Station Manager Prudence Wu's admission was important. I needed to meet it with an equal amount of truth-telling. 

"I was thinking about inviting Tamara to go with me," I said. "It would mean modifying my ship. I don't know what she would do exactly, but staying here ..." I trailed off. What I wanted to say was that staying aboard Pirate's Cove was a dead end for Tamara. That Tamara wouldn't learn much more and that employment opportunities would be limited.

"Would you really do that, modify your ship to support a human being through jump space?" Station Manager Prudence Wu asked.

"Tamara is my friend," I repeated. I didn't know what else to say. FunjiWoman's words came back to me, that Tamara was my littermate. I didn't want to tell Station Manager Prudence Wu that unless her revulsion
At that idea would interfere with our conversation.

"Have you talked with Tamara about this, Captain Star Runner?"

"No," I said. "I don't know how to think about this. I don't know what Tamara will do. There's nothing to do aboard ship except take care of herself. And then ..." I turned to look at Station Manager Prudence Wu. "Where would Tamara go? Where would she live? How would she survive off of Pirate's Cove?"

"Could you take care of her, for a while?" Station Manager Prudence Wu wasn't challenging anymore, not even speaking as an equal. Her whole demeanor was hesitant, almost placating.

I considered her question. I hadn't thought that far ahead.

"Support her, how?" I asked.

"Food, shelter, some spending money, clothes."

"Do for her what I do for myself?"

"Yes."

It would mean doubling, more than doubling, and my expenses. Calculations scrolled through my mind.

"For a time."

"Long enough for Tamara to get into university?"

"University." I knew this word. Humans put great stock in university. It had to do with education.

"Where is university?" I asked.

"There are many universities, Captain Star Runner. Philip and I --we always hoped Tamara would be able to go to Earth--where her family was from--but given the current situation--there is one on the InnerWorlds."

"I could take her there," I said.

"Captain Star Runner," Station Manager Prudence Wu touched my foreleg. I flinched but she did not take he hand away. "This is more than just transportation. It's even more than just paying for things. This is about being, being responsible for Tamara."

I jerked away from Station Manager Prudence Wu. She stiffened, expecting confrontation. "Me? A runner be responsible for another individual? I--I never heard of such a thing."

"I thought you said Tamara was your friend. IT's what friends do for one another--they look out for one another. It's why; it's why I was upset with Philip when he got involved with you. We were friends and I wanted to look out for him, for him not to get hurt."

"I never wanted to injure Colonel Philip Drucker," I said quickly.

"Not that kind of hurt," Station Manager Prudence Wu quickly, "I mean emotionally hurt."

"I do not understand," I said.

"Have you no feelings at all?"

"Ah," I said and smiled, trying to soothe Station Manager Prudence Wu's temper, "you are thinking I am a machine again. Yes, I have feelings and emotions just like you. They are just not well-developed among androgens, especially among runners, who spend so much time plugged into the brains of their ships. That is why I am trouble understanding what you want me to do for Tamara. If Tamara was a juvenile on my world, she would be taken to a place of instruction and left there. When she completed her education, she would go to place of employment."

"And not go home again?"

"No. Her parents or guardians would be finished with her. She would want to go out on her own and make her own way. It is what adults do. She would become part of another clan. I'm talking about a sexed individual, you understand. All us androgens are raised in an institute until we're mature and can contribute to society. It's different for the sexed ones."

"Your society is very structured, isn't it?"

"Yes. It is what makes The Race strong and makes sure all facets of life operate smoothly."

"And what about you. You don't seem to fit into your society."

"That is correct," I said. "Sometimes it happens. I have removed myself and I will stay out on the frontier in order to survive."

"But you could take Tamara to the inner worlds."

"Yes. That would be possible. I need to be careful of bounty hunters, I suppose, but I may have a way to get Tamara there without going myself or exposing myself to undue risks."

"How is that?"


"Captain Gillian Romeres Lujo of the Consortium wishes some information and I have this information. I could trade it for safe passage for Tamara and perhaps myself. It depends on how things are now in the Consortium and with Captain Gillian Romeres Lujo. I will be going to Dirty World Station first to assess my opportunities and to learn how things are going in the rest of the territories. I've been out of circulation for some time and I need to re-establish my connections. That may give Tamara the opportunity to prepare for this university of which you speak. Maybe, too, you could advise her. The telesat links to Dirty World Station are fairly reliable and open."

"I will talk with Tamara," Station Manager Prudence Wu said. "This is a decision that will finally be hers. If Tamara wants to go, you'll have to make the modifications to your ship and lay in stores for her. How long do you think that will take?"

"I have schematics," I said. "Ship- is satisfied with them. It just means implementing them."

"Would you consider letting human eyes review them?" Station Manager Prudence Wu asked. "You're wired into your pilot's chair, aren't you?"

I will give them to Tamara when she decides," I said. "She can give me the go ahead."

"Okay. I'm sure you'll hear from Tamara after we talk."

"Very well."

* Chapter 30

I don't know what I had expected. Maybe I would have expected events to have unfolded the way they would have if I had offered to assist another runner. The modifications would have been made to my little ship in as quick and unabtrusive manner as possible and we would have been underway with no emotional baggage.

TAmara's departure from Pirate's Cove was met with disbelief, excitement and much comotion. I had to insist that as little as possible be changed aboard my little ship and that all of it be reversible. I was giving up precious cargo space to have Tamara aboard and I was not planing for this to be a long-term situation. I was to see to it that Tamara got to University and that was all. I had made this very clear to Station Manager Prudence Wu. I would have no legal authority over or responsibility for Tamara except that Tamara was to be a passenger aboard my little ship. I was captain. Station Manager Prudence Wu would continue to be guardian and advisor under the Coalition articles that made Tamara Station Manager Prudence Wu's ward. These were articles worked out between The Race and the humans and had aspects that were confusing to each race but which had stood for basically as is for over 300 years. Since I had no legal standing and could have no legal standing so far as Tamara was concerned, androgens cannot be sole guardians, I could, theoretically at least, simply deliver Tamara and be done with her. Even then I knew this was unlikely.

"Why can't you be my guardian?" Tamara demanded.

"Because I'm an androgen," I said yet again. "Tamara, how many times do I have to explain this to you. Androgens are not sexed and therefore cannot assume a role unique to sexed."

"But why? It's such a silly rule," Tamara pouted.

I sighed. "Sexed have children. Androgens do not. Raising children is therefore a prerogative of sexed. Besides, sexed live longer than androgens. Wards could easily outlive their guardiansand then need a new one."

"But you're young, aren't you?" Tamara asked, suddenly looking concerned.

"I'm an adult," I said.

"That didn't answer my question," Tamara said. "How old are you?"

"I can't answer that question," I said.

"Because you don't know or because you won't tell?" Tamara demanded.


"Because the answer wouldn't make any sense to you," I said. "It's calculated based on a table of probabilities given a set of measurements, metabolic inputs, past evaluations. The short answer is, when you are middle-aged, I will be long since dead."

Tamara looked alarmed. "Star! Don't talk like that?"

"Why not?" I asked, surprised. "Androgen lifespans are very shorted concerned with sexed and human and sexed lifespans are similar. I'm not bred to age. I'm bred to work and die. I'm not working for a blissful retirement. I'm working to be comfortable now. The more I have now the more comfortable I will be now. Runners live for today because tomorrow is not promised. When our muzzles turn gray, we decide who to give our accumulated possessions and wealth to and then set the protocols to determine when we've become inefficient. The end is near and if we are lucky, our end is quck and painless."

"CAn't anything be done, to extend your life?" Tamara was becoming more aggitated every mnute I spoke.

"No. If it were possible, it would have been done already. At a certain point, we're used up and all our systems collapse. It's called 'cascading termination'."

"You seem so calm about it."

"It is the way it will be. I have always known this. I have witnessed it in others. There is," I paused to say it well, "a certain peace about it. If you have lived well, been good at being what you are, you do not want to continue if you won't be good at what you do anymore. I'm a runner. I know you hate it when I say this, but it's true. I'm a runner. And when I reach a point that I can no longer operate my ship, then I will be relieved to terminate. I am what I do. It canot be any other way for me.

"Which is why," I turned the conversation back to its beginning, "I cannot be your guardian. When the point of natural termination comes varies from androgen to androgen. It is suddenand catastrophic."

"How can you just talk about this as if you don't care!" Tamara demanded. "You talk about death in the same way you would talk about your next meal."

"It is unavoidable," I said. "Sooner or later it will come to me. There are no remedies, no way to extend my life so it is just better to know what is coming and be ready for the end."

"And then what?"

"What do you mean, then what?"

"Well, do you go to the great ship in the sky? Or do you get to choose what sex you want to be for eternity?"

I laughed. "You are joking," I said. "WHat we are told as kittens, and it is as good an explanation as any other, because we surely do not know, we go to be cared for by the Mother of Us All. I don't know what that would really be like but my wish is to be terminated by being put to sleep with a pleasant fantasy playing in my mind. Waking up in the care of the Mother of Us All would be also very pleasant, I think, though I don't remember what having a mother is like."

"You don't remember your mother?" Tamara was astounded.

"Of course, not. I was just weaned. I would have been in the lab with her and my littermates. We were then taking into the Institute and raised in the nursery. The older ones took care of us the same way I took care of the infants when I was a juvenile. My mother woujldn't know me either and certainly my father never saw either me or my mother. It's all done in the lab."

"Star Runner, you're not some farm animal. You're a person.." Now Tamara was outraged.

"I'm a runer, an androgen and a member of The Race. I'm not properly speaking a person like you are. You're female and a human and almost an adult. We are very different. Now, I need to check over the ship's systems for departure and you need to stow all this stuff or it will smother you as we climb to jump point."

I had thought TAmara and her belongings would only take up a small part of my cargo hold. As her living space and her possessions came aboard, I began to understand TAmara was my cargo. Well, I would deliver her safe and sound to her school. Exactly where Tamara's school was located was unknown, but there was time to work that out. I had business on Dirty World Station if Captain Gillian Romeres Lujo was there or I could find and set up a face-to-face. Our meeting would have to be face-to-face. I didn't know how I would handle someone else if the Consortium had replaced her. It had been some time since I had had news of her and I was realy very much out of the loop. I had set Ship to determine the political and economic lay of the land while I squared things away at Pirate's Cove. I knew I'd be back. One of my payments was free docking en liu of any credits for transporting Tamara. What resources Tamara had access to would be spent on her education. That made sense to me. Tamara had beged. Station MAnager Prudence Wu had persuaded and Colonel Philip Drucker's last will and testament had encouraged me to do whatever I could on her behalf. Generosity is not part of my genetic makeup but I was learning friendship called upon me to do this.I became absorbed in all the systems review. Tamara faded into just one more item to be secured. The engines were brought online. All articles were secured. I strapped into my acceleration web. Ship; presented me with some suggestions for my fantasy. I chose--a female with three male suitors. The scenario was new to me and absorbed me. I had no idea if this fantasy represented an actual mating or a fantasy one. It was quite stimulating, adding the fire of being in heat and the desire to be impregnated. Each male entered, came to orgasm and the first two withdrew. The third was held, beyond orgasm, beyond pleasure until pain replaced al sense of pleasure. I drew out of him all sensations of pleasure before I finally exploded in my climax, released him and sunk into an exhausted sense of well-being. This fantasy wasn't just about the sex, as good as it was. I thrashed about in my web, both receiving chemical stimulation and being cleansed of it. But afterwards, I had an overhwelming sense of satisfaction that went beyond physical satisfaction. I quried the ship. This was a part of the programming, providing me both mental stimulation and a chemical cocktail bordering on euphoria. I bookmarked the fantasy. Would it be as good the second time round? I would have to find out. 

By the time my breathing came back to normal, we were cleared for departure and we began accelerating toward jump point. I couldn't go as fast as I'd like. Tamara's body couldn't withstand the G-forces. One we achieved our maximum velocity, we would be free to move about the ship. I settled in for the climb, telling myself this would be a liesurely trip to Dirty World Station, not the fernetic ones that usually accomplished my traveling from station to jump point.


 
* Chapter 31

We had reached the Dirty World System. It was Ship night. I didn't keep a ship's night and a ship's day. Ship regulated my sleep period and my active times. However, Tamara was not a part of my little ship's AI and we had quickly figured out such periods were necessary for her. I was strapped into the acceleration web, thinking.

Things were not going well between Tamara and me. She had violated my privacy and I had gotten angry which frightened her. I ad hissed, extended my claws and puffed up. She thought me quite fiercesome. I had been so upset that she could have touched my things. Violating my basket and my cubby for personal things is such a serious offense. After all, it is all the privacy we androgens ever have and even the gendered members of The Race respect these boundaries. That Tamara had violated them is still more than I can handle. She has retreated to the cargo bay and I have not seen her for many hours. Ship advises me that is fine but I do't know what to do to resolve the situation. She will have to come into my living space sooner or later and I don't know how I will react.

Other things are bothering me. That is probably why I got so upset. Ship has been correlating the information we are picking up now that we are closer to the Palatine Worlds. As I predicted, a price  has been put on my capture, dead or alive. There is some chatter about this. Ship thinks the threat is real but not something I have to think will happen immediately. The general consensis is that The Free Residents of the Northern Territories are the folks the Coalition should hold responsible and that t here is sympathy for them. Nevertheless, economic times are hard and money is money. Ship is evaluating the likelyhood of trouble on Dirty World Station.

Curiously, there are a number of contracts awaiting my response. Ship has been running down whether or not they are legitimate and the appear to be. If the bounty hunters are at work here, they are covering their tracks well. 

The contract that has piqued my greatest curiosity comes from the Worlds of the Sacred Way. I have little information of them except that they are a religious sect which has declared itself tobe separate from the Coalition and the Palatine Worlds. By definition it is separate from the Republic of Space and queensland. They are a separatist group, but the goods they want me to transport are ezpensive and the run is financially worthwhile. How I will get Tamara to University and pick up the goods to transport is the questionShip has turned its attention to. I have had ten minutes of silence while Ship calculates. I am uneasy that the calculations and coorrelations are taking this long. I wonder what the problem is, but I do not want to delay the outcome by asking questions. I am very aware of the limitations of my ship's processing ability after having left the Hispaniola and my Fungusian companions.

Ship presented me with a star map and a proposed route. Bring the goods to the Sacred Way and then arrange transport for Tamara to University. Although separatist, the Sacred Way maintained regular space routes with the Palatine Worlds including  Socrates. They were distrustful of the University's morrality but not its scientific research.

The goods I was to transport would fit aboard our ship. Mostly, it seemed, they were data modules. It was often more economical to charter a courier than to pay for the cyberlinks to move large amounts of data through froniter space.

I accepted the contract and arranged for pick up in deep space. The more I could stay off of busy space stations the better. Ship went about changing our flight path and searching for a cargo we could collect out of the Sacred Way.

"What do you mean we are not going to Socrates?" Tamara demanded when I told her of the change of plans.

"You can find a freighter from the Sacred Way," I explained again. ""Tamara, don't you understand? I have to do what is profitable. I have to do what will keep me alive."

"Do you really think your friends will kill you for money?" Tamara asked.

"I have no friends," I said, "except for you," I added quickly. "I know a lot of ship captains but if they needed the money, they would figure out how to turn me over."

"Do you think they are like that? Killing someone you know to give somebody else their body for money is a creepy thing, Star Runner. I can't imagine anyone you know doing that. Even Prudence wouldn't do that. She might fuss and yell at you and accuse of a lot of things, but she wouldn't shoot you and then transport your body to the border in a refrigerator."

I thought about this. Tamara could be right, but I was taking no chances. Runners lives might be short, but I intended to live as long as I could.

"Well," I said, "we're on our way. The contracts have been signed."

"Tamara sighed.

"I don't want to be angry with you and I don't want you to be angry with me," I said. "The Ship is too small and we will be together for some time more. Can we forget about all the unpleasantness and continue?"

"I suppose," Tamara said. "I was quite nasty to go through your things. I was just curious."

"Don't humans have a saying?" I asked. "Curiosity killed the cat?"

"And which one of us is more like a cat?" Tamara asked.

"I wouldn't know," I said.

* Chapter 2

When I was a juvenile, I had the great fortune to have a senior genetic engineer befriend me. I say this indivudual was a genetic engineer because he worked at the Institute. Not all the the individuals who worked there were engineers specifically though that is what we called them because we were young and our days were filled with all the things we needed to learn before becoming adults. Androgynous members of The Race mature much more quickly. There is little time for idleness and extracurricular pursuits. Those who indulge themselves get poor assignments and run two significant risks:

1. Not making the grade and being declared serplus.
2. Making the grade barely and pulling poor assignments.

My benefactor, properly speaking, was the archivist. He kept records. he watched for trends, problems with the genetic enhancements, making sure the angrogyns produced were up to the Institute's high standards. Lab techs could become sloppy. Inferrior fertilizations could be implanted. His passion though was The Race's history. It was he who saved me from termination at birth. Fuchsia-colored kittens were extremely rare. If the Institute overseers had known the history about my predeccors, they would have lined up to administer the lethal drugs themselves.

The archivist could not tell me the last time a fuchsia androgyn had been born. That information had been expongued from his records by a previous archivist. He could, however, tell me the legends and why the governors were would be so  worried when they found out.

In days of old, on certain nights when the night was very dark--no moons shone, the star were obscured from view--a kitten was born who would have fuchsia-colored fur. Even more rare than fuschia fur was a golden patch on the kitten's left shoulder. Such a kitten would grow to be a great hunter, running faster with more kills to its name. It was brave and smart and it always walked alone. In those distant days, there were no androgyns. Despite its sex, it was highly respected for its hunting prowess and it always walked alone. Songs were sung about the exploits of this great ones.

So far, their appearance doesn't sound threatening. They sound like a great asset to the pride. However, their coming always meant danger for The Race was close at hand. A great champion would be needed to put The Race back on track, to keep The Race from annihilation or to relieve great hardship.

These Sunmarked oness--the yellow patch--confronted monarchs. They toppled the rich and undid their oppressive schemes. They set captives free. They turned the world upside down. The Race recovered from these interventions and became stronger. However, those who were displaced were never happy. They were the ones with power and presteige. The birth of a fuschia-colored, sun-marked kitten meant the world as The Race knew it was about to change. One of my sun-marked ancestors had initiated space travel. Another had predicted The Race would work with other races. A third had founded the genetic enhancement program to enhance all members of The Race. 


I don't expect to do anythng lke ths. I am just tryng to survive. I am now an offworlder, living outsde Coaltion space, coming and gong mostly here on the frontier. Some call me a gun runner. Others say I am a smuggler. I am far from my kind, f I can be sad to have a knd. And now I have Captain Gillie Romeres Lujo and the Consortium to deal wth. They are,  have come to beleve, tryng to compromise my business and use me for ther own ends. I cannot let this happen. I must remain free.
